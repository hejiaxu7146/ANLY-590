"The food is fantastic.  Great atmosphere and staff.  The tables have lit candles and some fine dining music is playing.  They have daily specials. If you happen to visit on a night where their special is the Rigatoni Bolognese, do not pass it up.  It is fantastic. 

My wife and I each tried their salads.  The Cesar and the Chopped Italian salad are fantastic.  All portions are large in comparison to most restaurants.  

We didn't get to try the deserts this time around but they look incredible. 

Definitely will return.",1.0
"Prime Cleaning is absolutely amazing. They did a wonderful job and are reasonably priced.  There was no song and dance with their pricing either (problems I had before with other companies.) 

Donovan, the technician, was extremely professional and helpful. I'll post a picture later. 

Overall: Amazing and Honest company.",1.0
"We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the ""lot"" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when\/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.

Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, ""small"" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are ""very large"".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to ""snack"".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).

We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since ""papa"" means 'potato').

I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.

The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).

While I agree with the other, previous 17 reviewers that this is a very nice restaurant, I am not wowed enough to give it 5 Stars.  Those who read my reviews know I'm not generous with my highest rating and you've got to earn it.  For those looking for something different, tasty and served with good attitude, this restaurant is just fine.  If you're a big eater, don't expect to come here and not want something more afterwards.  No one there looked unhappy and we weren't either ... just not full.",1.0
"Passed by here while heading to First Markham Place's food court, and had been attracted by the sign of ""afternoon tea at 2pm"".    This place is used to be my fave noodle place; Kenny's noodle.  Haven't been popping in since Kenny's changed hands.  Friends have been recommended this place, and saying that their dinner is good!  The decor reminded me of Kenny's once I stepped in.  The server was friendly and gave us the menu for afternoon tea right away.  We had the chicken burger with fries and chicken and ham spaghetti in cream sauce; both $4.99 each including drinks.  The chicken was crispy and the bun was toasted just right.  The topping of lettuce and tomato were crisp and there was right amount of mayo.  I was actually just wanted to have a bite but finally I had finished half of it, and leaving the spaghetti nearly untouched - no more hassle cooking tonight :p They are having special on lobster; $10.99\/lb!!  Afternoon tea ranging from $2.99 to $6.99 includes drinks.  Good deals....... yummy food ......... excellent service!!",1.0
"I stopped by for lunch and grabbed a quick bite... The wait from order to food wasn't long at all... The waitress at the bar made some small talk and was very sweet... 

The croissant I ordered with ham and swiss was delicious... I loved the ratio of meat and cheese to bread... Sometimes with croissants, it's hit or miss... lol  I was very unimpressed with the tomato bisque... The first couple of spoonfulls were really good, but then it just turned sugary out of nowhere... I couldn't finish it... 

The parking definitely leaves a lot to be desired... And the lot could stand to be repaved, so watch your wheels as you navigate... 

If I'm in the area, I might venture in again... It wasn't bad, but it didn't knock my socks off either... Maybe I'll order something different next time...",1.0
"Real Men Don't Eat Quiche.(1)  So fine, I'll just turn in my man card for a month.  Only served on Saturdays and the ingredients change according to availability.  This generous portion of quiche in bacon spinach form was enjoyed by 3 of the 6 people at our table.  It came with a bowl of diced melons.  Not to say it is the only good thing to eat here as everything ordered at the table disappeared quickly from our plates.  Including a shared stack of pancakes of which I had one.  But the quiche alone is enough reason to get there on a Saturday.

This was my first time at the new digs.  The small parking lot is saved by having street parking along the canal.  There are more tables here but on this Saturday late morning there was never more than a couple of empty tables at any given time.  With the layout large groups have to be broken up.  Service was spot on.  And the owner was visible in the dining room most of the time helping out where needed.

"So glad we decided to check out this new restaurant! We went for lunch so it didn't end up being super crowded. The service was amazing- our drinks were constantly full.  The guacamole was fantastic and if you order one thing on the menu, seriously, make it the street corn. That stuff is unreal. The tacos we tried, Baja and Pollo en Mole, were good but nothing to write home about. Our only complaint was the music. We didn't think it was too loud like other yelpers suggest, but it they were playing sad, slow country ballads. Not exactly what I would think of for their atmosphere and definitely not my preferred genre.",1.0
"This was my first time staying down in the old part of Vegas. Or even going to the old part of Vegas for that matter. I found a good deal for The Plaza online and figured since we were only going to be there a really short time it would be ok, even if it was a  dive. It definitely was NOT a dive. VERY nice rooms!  The bed was super comfortable and pretty big. We almost had a nice view but had a little bit of roof in the way (seems to always be my luck). Not bad at all for $50 a night. 

My only complaint is that the walls are really thin. The neighbor's TV was pretty loud in our room.

I'd definitely stay here again though!

As far as the casino goes it was just meh. We hung out down there at around 1:30-2 am and never saw a cocktail waitress the whole time. I was so thirsty we ended up just going to the room. Also it's really annoying that they do not have those little ticket redemption machines and that you have to go up to the cashier to cash out your tickets.",1.0

"This place is wonderful! Very accommodating and provides a great option for making acupuncture more financially accessible (and therefore able to be taken advantage of weekly or more), all the while respecting the profession and not cheapening it.

"I almost gave this place 1 star, but since our waitress didn't question our alcoholism [too much] and added more tequila to our drinks upon request, I decided to give it 2.

We had just landed in Vegas and were craving huge margaritas and snacks. Since it was almost noon (that's 3 oclock dc time okay?), we were seated right away. The cheapest margarita was $9, which in Vegas is not a lot at all, but if I'm going to pay $9 for the shittiest alcohol they have, there better at least be a lot of it in my drink. There wasn't...so we asked the waitress if they could add a bit more alcohol (obviously asians age well so maybe she thought I was like 18 or something and gave me a virgin). She basically rolled her eyes, but brought it back with a nice shot on top. Cool. 

We ordered only a few guacs and quesos for the table and she basically rolled her eyes again (sorry this was our first day, not ready to be big spenders yet). Both tasted fine, nothing special. HOWEVER, each dip came with a plate of like 10 stale chips. R U serious??? But luckily enough for us the bowls that the guac and queso came in were edible so obviously we crushed those.

Also, the waitress was confused x1000000 when we split the bill. All we did was put down the amount each person owed next to their last name on the receipt so I'm not really sure why she didn't get it.",1.0

"Ordered green chili burrito, enchilada style. What can I say, I should have stuck with the main item in this place, fried bread, but I had a craving for green chili meat, nice and stewed. Too bad I didn't satisfy the craving here. The green chili was way too mushy (maybe too much flour in the sauce?) and it had only small pieces of meat, I had to fork around trying to find them.  My wife ordered the chicken enchiladas, she liked the red sauce, solid flavor, chicken was shredded and tasty. My aunt ordered the combo plate of green chili: she liked the refried beans and rice, huge flour tortilla, but she had the same opinion of the green chili,   mushy and not enough meat. My aunt did say she had previously tried the fried bread and thought those were great. The place itself was super clean, nicely decorated for the holidays, service was fast and friendly. Based on the cleanliness and excellent service, I'll definitely try it again for the fried bread.",1.0
I must have been expecting too much from the previous reviews I read because this place was everything but fantastic. The bartender was completely out of it and had a hard time remembering anyone's tab although I could count the amount of people at the bar on one hand. The food was mediocre at best. And to top it all off when we went to cash out we learned that half of our bill didn't belong to us...save yourself and find a different dive bar to spend your money at,1.0
"The stars are for the front desk woman, who was always smiling and very nice.  I had my vehicle towed here following an accident at which my front left tire randomly came flying off while I was driving.  They had my car for almost three weeks and my car LOOKS great.  However, the next day there was a creaking noise and I brought my car back.  The mechanics took it right away and then came out to the waiting room and told me that all three of my other tires were loose, but they tightened them and it's good to go now.  I was happy it was an easy fix BUT considering they had my car for 3 weeks, and my car was there because my front left tire had come off while I was driving, SHOULDN'T they have checked my other tires?  Also, everyone knows that rotors should be replaced in pairs, but they only replaced my left one.  The entire thing just makes me question whether they truly assessed my vehicle as a whole, and not just the obvious left, front side.",1.0

"I've been here twice in the past few weeks and I have to say that I've had a very consistent experience. The pad thai - or phud thai, as they call it here - is pretty standard. I would warn against being too liberal with the spiciness levels as they do go up quite quickly and dramatically. The serving size is quite generous and I like to share it with someone else. Usually I find that a salad or another appetizer plus the pad thai is enough for two. Their salads are not particularly interesting - the mango salad consisted primarily of sliced mangoes, which is a stark contrast to the usual mango salad where you get a bed of lettuce topped sparsely with mangoes.
 
Overall Salad King is really inexpensive and the service is fast. The trade-off is that there are communal tables - where you'll probably end up if you're in a small party - and that the restaurant space can be quite loud. I've found myself yelling both times I went there so I've resolved to only go back to Salad King when conversation isn't the focal point of the meal.",1.0
"This place is exactly what the name says... A dive. Therefore, if you're expecting something more, then it sounds like you let the obvious notion slip right by you. It is a small bar that is an open space. They have great drink specials everyday with $2 shots, drinks and beers!  They are well known for their skeeball machines (and tournaments) and hosting OSU Buckeye game watch parties!  This place gets really packed for OSU games. It is hit or miss sometimes outside of that, but I have seen it really packed on Saturday nights because they do have a good DJ that plays a wide range of popular music (old and new!).

This place isn't much for decor and ambiance... But again, you need to remember that we are talking about a ""dive bar"" so they do live up to that name perfectly.

I don't know what the malfunction is in the women's restroom though. The sink countertop is constantly covered in water all the time. I always feel the need to clean it, but it's like this every time!",1.0
"They would get three stars if it weren't for one thing... SEASONING!!! Everything we ordered was completely lacking in flavor and didn't have any salt and pepper on it. We started with the golden wings that were good, but not great. I ordered a focaccia with balsamic sirloin, mushroom, onion, and cheese. Sounded good, but it just tasted like balsamic grease. I also went with half sweet potato chips and fries. The fries has no seasoning and needed to be cooked a couple more minutes to make them a little crispy. The sweet potato chips were ok, but again no salt and pepper. My fiancé ordered the onion rings, and of course there was not a single grain of salt on those onion rings. The food was disappointing to say the least.

Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, but I don't understand how anyone can run a kitchen and let all of the food leave your kitchen without salt. I wouldn't come here for the food after this experience, but would consider having a couple beers here.",1.0
"I've been out to a few different Duckworth's locations now and they seem to do a good job at keeping their atmosphere and service above par without being ""cookie-cutter"" by any means. 

I came out to this location after work one day and took advantage of the all drafts $3.50 special. Great place to come out for a few drinks with co-workers, but also looks like a fresh joint for low-key nightlife. I haven't had their food here yet, but assuming it is on the same quality level as the other locations, you won't be disappointed.

Again, the atmosphere and service shine here. TV's all over for good sports coverage on associated game days.",1.0

the show side is at like 8 or 10 where you sit there and watch them do there stuff
and the other side has like a dinner and you watch like some of the mini shows that happen
I do have to say this does deserve 5 stars mainly because I rate this place based on if I would return again after watching it....

"Without a doubt, the best buffet in Vegas now.
No contest.
Puts other casino buffets to shame.

People reading this 3 months from now will think I'm a lying prick, but let this document serve as a testament that at this point in time and space, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesar's is the most kick-ass buffet in town.

As we all know, things in Vegas have a way of changing, sometimes from minute to minute.  When the next mega-resort opens, the crown will certainly change, but it will definitely take a page from Bacchanal's playbook.

Caesar's has upped the bar for what Buffet's can and should provide.

It ain't cheap, over fifty bucks a head for dinner, but you get Kwality, with a capital ""K""!
Rumor has it that Caesar's spent over $17million on the remodel and food upgrades.  The money was well-spent.  Selection is mind-boggling.  Most items are made in small batches to maintain quality and freshness.
I also like the fact that the kitchen seems to allow some discretion with the menu.  Not all the offerings are directed towards the Western palatte, and as many of the cooks are Mexican, Filipino, or Chinese, some offerings are more ""ethnic"" than what you'd expect.  I had a Mexican menudo soup that rivaled anything served at my local tacqueria!  When I told the timid midwesterner that it was tripe soup, she nearly fainted... 
I like that the kitchen takes chances like this.  All of their food may not appeal to the average joe, but there's interesting and tasty stuff on the menu if you keep your eyes and mind open.

During peak Vegas season, plan on eating at oddball times (e.g. 6am breakfast or 3pm dinner), if you don't like waiting in lines.  Otherwise, plan on at least a 2-3 hour wait.  Caesar's does have a neat computerized reservation kiosk that will text you when to return, but it only means that you return to a 30-40 minute line...

So either spend like a whale at Caesar's to get comped line passes, or plan accordingly.  You have been warned.

One warning, stay away from the peanut butter stuffed chocolate cookies at the dessert bar.  
Those little bastards are more addicting than heroin.",1.0

It's basically just a really good, nice, modern pub. Huge whisky selection, and everything else. We were a group of 8, so we ordered all kinds of stuff. I had bites of samosa, Shephard's pie, green salad, scotch egg, and it was all just AMAZING. Also the drinks were strong, and the service was good. 

Also, at first there wasn't a table, but we got a 4 seater, and grew it into an 8 seater within the hour. Also, I thought our check would be expensive, but it turned out pretty average to be honest.

"Looking for that eclectic oasis in the downtown area?  Maybe you're looking for a tropical fix, anytime of the day? Well Frankie's Tiki Room definitely has what you're looking for! I chose this joint one night, partly because my friends have said some pretty amazing things about this place. Man, I'm glad I chose it!

Frankie's is located west of the I-15 on Charleston.  If you've passed the gas station and Wendy's, you've already missed it.  Bright pink neon lights line the side and front of the building.  Trust me, you'll see it! The building looks like an old adobe style building with a half circle arch entrance.  Along with the joint's name on the building, the archway is labeled with ""Kahi Maluhia Loa I Ka Honua.""  With all my years of high school Hawaiian 101 classes, the only meaning I can think of is ""Peace on Earth.""  Keep in mind that Hawaiian is super conceptual and can have many meanings but I think they meant to wish everyone good peace! 

Once you enter the tiki guarded doors, you are literally taken to the entertainment version of the southern Pacific islands.  The lights are super dim and intimate. The place is filled with the Pacific island theme: wooden carvings, netting, fisherman's glass balls, thatched hut awnings and of course, tikis!  The seating area offers variety for everyone.  There's bar tops, high tops, table seating and booths.  Along with low lit green, yellow and blue ceiling lights, the main color in the room is red.  Red glass candle holders on tables and red lights against the walls, creates a fiery, lava look.  All in all, this place offers a very on point theme!

On the night I visited, the bartenders were Mike who had dreads and Nate who rocked an epic beard.  When it came to the service, they were AH-MAZE-ING! Super nice, they introduced themselves to me and my guest.  These guys were attentive, personable and really made my experience a great one.  As my first visit, I enlisted them to choose some of their most popular drinks. Here's what they recommended to me.  Keep in mind that there are more ingredients in these drinks.  The menu only displayed the main ones:

Fink Bomb: A mellow blend of coconut rum, 160-proof rum floater, melon liqueur and pineapple juice. The bartenders recommend mixing the floater in. Man, this drink gives you a kick! The 160-proof rum floater is super strong and brings a spunky life to this libation.  Thank goodness for the sweetness of the coconut and pineapple combination or I'd be sleeping in the booth!

Kahiki Kai: Coconut rum, banana liqueur and pineapple juice, garnished with a cherry and cut of pineapple. This drink is the tropical punch you've been waiting for.  The pineapple juice offers a pleasant tart flavor, accompanied with coconut and hint of banana.

Malekula: Coconut rum, Tuaca, melon liqueur and pineapple juice.  The coconut rum is super prominent in this drink.  Accompanied with the melon liqueur, your sweet tooth with certainly thank you!

Bearded Clam: Light rum, simple syrup, mint leaves and passion fruit juice.  This is your classic mojito with a tropical twist.  First sip is a bit tart; however the passion fruit really changes the flavor in the after taste.  Super awesome!

At the end of the day, I had a wonderful time at this place.  Minus the smoky atmosphere, you have great bartenders, a chill vibe and super awesome drinks.  I don't know why it's taken this long to try this place out but I can tell you this: I will definitely be back!  If you're in the area, you need to check this place out!",1.0
"This place over charges. My compressor on my ac went bad.  I needed a new one. Instead of a price break down . I got a menu of prices from 4800 to 2400 to put in a new compressor . The diffrence from the 4800 come with  2 yar warrenty vs 2400 comes with 6 months warrenty.  A new compressor  only cost around 1000 and a new system is about 4000.  I dont  recommend this place if you have ac problems.  I went somewhere else and have a new compressor, fan, capacitor put in and only 1700.",1.0

"Sleezy and a scam. The guy expects to keep your old wheels after you buy new ones from him. His guys in the back even agree that he's an unethical business owner. He does have decent prices but I'd take the time and a little extra money in order to buy from Discount or other tire retailers. The wheels I tried buying didn't fit right and needed a spacer.

"Not bad, Cosmo.  Not bad.  Decided try out RRL with the wife and a few friends to figure out what all the hype is about at that ""new place in The Cosmopolitan"".  Hit up a 6pm reservation to try out some of the eats on the restaurant side and decided to focus only on that this time around (in other words, we skipped the show and decided to grub down and budget on that instead).  We were immediately greeted and ushered through a few doors before settling in at our dinner table.  THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE RESTAURANT ONLY!  Here's what I experienced:

- Service was ON POINT.  Our waiter and various servers were very attentive to our dinner party and accommodated us whenever we had a question about the menu, drinks, decor, etc.  I would say this was probably the best thing about my RRL experience.  Service is not usually a top priority to me but the staff did damn well and reflected the price I was paying tonight if not more!

- Watch your wallet; the price here is STEEP.  The $$$$ above this review is a correct assessment of the price points you will commit to when visiting.  Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind shelling out some hard-earned cash for good food.  However, we just came for dinner in a party of 4 and was hit with multiple ""taxes"" including auto-gratuity (18%), an entertainment tax (even though we didn't go to the show), service tax (??) and sales tax (which is a given).  What?  Felt a little blindsided there with all of the charges but I guess coming over to sing a song with the glass harmonica player yielded some kind of extra charge........ remember, restaurant side only.

- The food and drinks.  The food, although served ""tapas style"" and pretty small, was actually pretty good.  I enjoyed the Uni and Lobster Perciatelli, the Branzino on creamed spinach and topped with raisins, and fresh oysters with a side of horseradish butter WHICH WAS THE BOMB BTW.  But the highlight of the night was the BRUSSEL SPROUTS.  Hot damnnn!  You must get this when you come here.  Period.  Those dishes were the culinary highlights IMO and although they didn't amaze the crap out of me for the price, it was pretty damn tasty.  THE DRINKS were pretty good as well.  Reminiscent of cocktails at H&R or The Laundry Room, these drinks hit the spot too.  I opted for the Pisco Punch and it was a nice chill drink to sip on throughout the night.

- The entertainment, although we didn't get to see the show, spilled over into the main room where we were eating for a little bit.  We got to hear a few tunes from the live band, some singing\/beatboxing from a performer, and some carnival-like antics.  I would consider coming to just watch the band play but if I get hit with entertainment charges for doing that, then I probably would come less often.. (can't you tell I'm still a little irritated with that ent. charge...) Anyway, from what we saw, it was entertaining and kept us occupied during dinner for a short while and enhanced the ambiance a bit.

Overall, I give the RRL dining experience a 3.5 (rounded up to 4) star.  The ambiance and service was stellar and the food was pretty good but the price and size of the dishes and extra random charges definitely offset the positives of our visit.  I know it's the Cosmo on the strip and all but the charges added on to the bill that wasn't anticipated soured it for me (third time about the ent. charge.. grrr... okay, I'm done now haha).  Like I said, I don't mind spending top dollar for stellar eats but it wasn't a mind blowing awesome experience that would garner an immediate second look. Maybe I will come back to catch the midnight showing of Nocturne at the $27.27 price point but I don't think I'll be back any time soon to dine in only.  I'd rather catch some quick drinks, sit around and listen to some jazz tunes, and converse a little with friends before venturing elsewhere for the night.  Will update on the next visit.

Edit: Looked into the entertainment tax and decided that I shouldn't kill the messenger.. still irritating but that's the way the mandate works, I guess. Nice place and grubs but unfortunately the tax imposed for entertainment w\/o seeing the actual show is still a buzzkill.",1.0

"Every time I come to Arizona, I always have at least one dinner with my dad.  Usually it's at a place around the corner from his house, sometimes it's at a sushi restaurant, sometimes the AYCE Brazilian BBQ.   This time he picked SumoMaya, and I am so glad he did.

It seemed really out of place in a business park, but once inside I decided it was one of the best restaurant layouts I've ever seen.  There was a (fake) tree right behind our table, and the whole restaurant was open to the outside lights, yet enclosed so it wasn't too hot.  The kitchen was also open so you could see them making the food.

Our server was super friendly and helped us pick out some dishes.  I have to say literally everything that was put on our table was amazing.  We've dined at SushiSamba before and you can tell the chef came from there, as some of the dishes seemed to come from there.  Our favorite was the tuna tacos, of which we ended up ordering another round at the end of the meal.

I just can't say enough good things about this place.  Even the basic sushi rolls were amazing.  Can't wait to go back!",1.0
"The way this was talked up, I was imagining a large town with multiple displays as the name is Christmas Town USA.. however it was nice to see, especially for a small town gathering.

We got there early to avoid the traffic, and boy were we glad that we did when we left!  The traffic was backed up all the way down the interstate from the south, and the entrance from the north was completely barricaded off.  We visited on Christmas day and arrived when it was still light out.. approximately 4:45\/5 PM.. when it's not dark yet and the lights aren't on, it doesn't look like much.. an unfinished development we some lights and some original older brick ranchers with classic tree, red bows, and nativity sets.  When the lights came on at 5:30, we waited about 15 minutes until it finally got dark... and man what a show!!!  Love the lake with the Christmas trees lit up all the way around it, the first house next to the McAdenville Common Market, the ""Believe"" bench, ""Merry CHRISTmas"" sign, and many more statues, decorations and light displays.

Been there once, don't think i'd venture back.. but it was worthwhile, family-friendly fun and something nice to do.  I especially liked how the entire town participates in the festivities from the elementary school to church to firehouse to homes, both new and old.  I would possibly return for the Christmas tree lighting or Yule Log celebrations with choral concerts in the future.

On another note, I missed the Billy Graham Library Live Nativity Scene this year and would love to check it out next year.  The Ballantyne Hotel & Lodge Gingerbread Lane was deliciously exciting!",1.0
"Located in an obscure mini mall in Henderson, I came here with my friend on a drizzly day in July. 

When we arrived the restaurant was pretty empty. Just one other table was occupied, so the waitress told us to sit wherever we liked. Henry's has a home-y vibe. Lots of large booths and tables available to accommodate large and small parities alike.

Our server approached us quickly for our drink order and returned swiftly with our drinks and carafes for each of us. As someone who requires lots of refills, I was a fan of this. 

Everything on the menu looked great so it took a while to figure out what we wanted. Our server helped us out by letting us know what her favorites on the menu were. She also explained that everything is made from scratch, so I was already excited about our meal.

My friend ordered the Savannah burger with waffle fries and I ordered the fried shrimp with crispy fries and cole slaw. The food came out and it was delicious. My friend's burger was enormous and despite his hearty appetite was only able to finish half before throwing in the towel. My shrimp was tasty and fresh.

"Listen. I understand that I'm reviewing a Dairy Queen so I shouldn't be expecting much in terms of service. But honestly, I really don't want to go back to this location because of the terrible way the employees deal with customers. 

I came here on a Friday night in February with my boyfriend. We were getting some ice cream for ourselves and to take to some people back home. The place was busy, yes, but there is no need to have 4 teenage kids working one shift while in reality only two are taking orders and making ice cream.. Anyhow. 

We first walked in and went to their frozen case to pick up a box of Dilly Bars. I picked one out of the box and walked to the counter so we could complete our order. While holding the box, I realized that there was some sticky sauce on the outside. I didn't even say anything to the employee, I just sat the box on the counter and wiped my hands with a napkin. Before I could place the order, he snatched the box away from me and told me to go get another one. He didn't offer that I could get another, he demanded. Awkwardly, I got another box and ordered an ice cream cone with sprinkles. Before we could tell him what else we wanted, he walked away and came back with the cone. We intended to order three more blizzards, but had to order them one at a time because we couldn't manage to get the order out without the guy rolling his eyes and slumping over to the ice cream machine to make a blizzard. Are you serious? Do you really not need any business? He seemed so annoyed that we kept adding items on to our order, but if he just stayed and listened to the whole thing he wouldn't have created more work for himself! Essentially he just made himself mad and took it out on us.. He even made sighs when we were asking for what we wanted. What a joke. I paid for our ice cream and left. Seriously terrible customer service. Of course the ice cream is good, but it's Dairy Queen so it's pretty universal whether you get it here or across the country.

The last time we had to go, I had the spinach hollandaise crepes. The crepes tasted fine, but they barely put any hollandaise sauce on. There might have been a teaspoon for two crepes. The spinach on the insides looked brown and tasted old or frozen. We also ordered a side of sausage. We were charged $4.00 for 1 patty...that's ridiculous!

I have been to this place numerous times over the past ten years and it's only gone downhill the past few years. For the price I expect a decent wash and dry.... what you get is dirty wet rags smearing more dirt and streaks onto your windows (inside and out), half-ass job of wiping down the inside (seriously - don't advertise that you are going to wipe down the console if you are not going to wipe it at all), uncleaned mats thrown back into your car in the wrong places, and a very unenthusiastic staff. 

During my last visit (and why I will never return and why I finally decided to Yelp about this place), the employee who was to dry the car wiped a quarter of one rim after I asked if he would wipe down the rims since they were so dirty (I offered to pay if this service cost extra) - he then dropped the already dirty rag on the ground in a puddle, picked it up, forgot about the rims, and started wiping down my car with it!

"****Watch Your Pennies, and Your Dollars***

Reserved a standard car w \/ no upgrades and unlimited mileage for a trip. Prior to reserving, I joined Hertz gold plus rewards to get any additional discount available. Arrived at hertz, lobby was packed. A woman walked along side the line and asked were there any gold plus members. Of course I said yes. She informed me that I didn't have to stand at the back of this line, I could go to the gold plus member location. So off I go. Walk into the booth, sales person asked my name and said you can pick up your car at at #'d stall. That was easy!
Get to the car, it looked fine as far as I was concerned. I get to exit booth where they electronically scan your vehicle before leaving lot. At this point the attendant asked if I want to prepay for gas. Not being a frequent renter of cars, I ask...How does that benefit me? She says that when I get back, ""We will fill the tank up at a rate of $3.11"", which is cheaper than the street. I agree. There's no price quote before they run my card. I get a long folded receipt, my mistake was in not trying to hold up the line, knowing what my daily rate was, I didn't look at it. I get home and look at the receipt...WAIT A MINUTE!!
I was charged for a vehicle upgrade, SiriusXM radio and $60 bucks for gas prepay. 
I call the Hertz center where I got the car from, explain to them what the discrepancy was. 
This  ""CHICK"" on the phone says ""well why did you leave if it was wrong?""
I try to explain to this ""BIRD"" that I reserved what I thought was a Nissan Altima, Or comparable car, a standard vehicle. I received a Chevy Malibu which as far as I am concerned was a standard vehicle. It doesn't list anywhere on the vehicle what class it's considered nor does it list upgraded features. On top of that, you don't get the detailed billing statement until you're two(2) tires off the lot!! 
She ask me to hold, I get transferred to their corporate office. The individual says she doesn't know why they transferred me there but she will have the supervisor from the location call me. I wait about an hour, then drive back to Hertz. I explain again!! I was very clear in what was wrong. The attendant says ""well, the system says this is what it is"". I tell him that I don't care what your system says. I have an emailed confirmation with all the terms I agreed to. He asks to see email. I show him and he says o.k. Makes changes to the system and gives me another long folded receipt. I go through it and I see he did take off for the SiriusXM radio but not the vehicle upgrade. I approach again and explain that my confirmation was at a very specific daily rate for a standard car. He asks to see email again and says well you have a full size car which is more $$. I say ""then give me the standard vehicle at the rate I originally agreed to"". Needless to say, I kept the same car at the lower rate. This was more of a pain in the butt than I care to write.

   Upon returning the car, just knowing that the tank was about $15 - $20 bucks shy of being filled that I would get the difference back @ a rate of $3.11 per gallon.
 Wrong again!! Now I was explained the add'l $60 deposit differently, Now it is for the convenience of them filling it up, no matter where the tank was. When I questioned it, the attendant starts talking about.. because you went over 100 miles a day, so forth, and so on, just jargon! I explain that I had unlimited mileage. I get more jargon.

  It cost me an add'l $60 bucks for the ""Gas Tank Riddle"" when I could have filled it up just outside the airport for no more than $20 bucks. This is after the hurdles I already had to jump through to get the price I was originally quoted.

I use to love this place but my last few visits have been less than pleasant. That's probably being nice. 

They are quite pricy but it use to be worth it as the food was that good but this last year something has dropped. My first issue with this restaurant came on a game night, now I have been here many times before but never on a game night. A few of us decided to go out and I recommended Saddle Ranch. It was happy hour but due to game night they did not honor those prices,
I was unaware of that but we stayed. My drink was massively watered down. Normally their drinks are quite strong but that night barley tasted any alcohol in my drink. My friend got nachos and was asked if he wanted to upgrade it with steak and avocado, he said yes. Needless to say ended up being $30 worth of nachos with a handful of steak bits and maybe a tablespoon of avocado, very disappointing. I felt bad for recommending it and blamed it on being a game night.

Brings me to tonight all I wanted was a side of fries and a half a cookie which is my favorite. I called in the order and went to pick it up so I don't have to wait there. I got home started to eat the fries,....they were mushy and crispy on the ends like they had been sitting there all day and were put in the microwave. When I moved on to the cookie it wasn't half-baked it was raw. A pile of cookie dough in a box. When I called the restaurant to complain and asked for a manager I could not get a hold of anyone. Two phone calls later finally got someone on the line, I asked for a manager and was transferred to the Event Coordinator. Called for the fourth time finally got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on, he offered to make me a new one if I came back which I did not want to do since I was already home. $18 for fries and a cookie and both were awful. He took my name and number and said he would have the corporate office call me back so we will see how that goes. In conclusion this restaurant has gone downhill and every time I go food gets worse. I should have gone to Walmart and got cookie dough and a bag of fries and it would have been better than what I got.",1.0

"Ate here with my mother and brother while I was in town visiting my family. 
Wow, when I lived in Cleveland this street was just a quiet little stretch of nothing behind Mitchells Ice Cream, now it's a hoppin' block of restaurants! 

Love the indoor and outdoor seating, and the open front, we sat up front and had a nice kind of half indoor, half outdoor experience, which was perfect for the cool and lovely summer evening. 

My mother had  Pinot Grigio, and I had Chardonnay, and both were lovely and well priced. 

The cheese plate was tasty, good cheese options and lovely little accompaniments, the fresh fennel is a great touch. If you like soft, creamy cheeses try the Delice de Borgogne, you will not regret it. 

I had the mussels, my mother had the shrimp, and we split a strawberry salad, and all three were lovely. The mussels that day were sriracha and kale, and they were great. I love all of those ingredients, so it was pretty much a match made in heaven. The salad was lovely too. My brother had one of the flatbreads and was also happy.

We shared a creme brulee for dessert. The flavor of the day was creamy orange and it was also lovely. 

Noticed some people complained about the waitstaff, so just wanted to add that our waitress was lovely. Seated us immediately, came around to check on us just the right amount of times, wasn't too pushy, etc. 

Great spot, will definitely return when I'm next in town!",1.0
"Overpriced, bad service and we went really late after 9 p.m. so no excuse for crap service when four waiters just stood around. Waitress was rude and impatient when I asked her which pizza's better between a couple of choices I was debating on, as she was abrupt and only recommended a spicy one when I kept telling her spicy doesn't matter.  She brought my friend's wine in little glass vase and reached over dishes to pour it quickly into her wine glass already on table then walked off...She didn't pickup the glass and didn't ask my friend to taste it, which is not the norm at other places I've been to.  Pizza had very tiny slivers of prosciutto, lots of cheese and sauce. Flavours weren't bad and I realized it was too salty because of the anchovies so not their fault, but I much prefer other Neapolitan pizza joints.  When we left, an old big woman whom appeared to be an owner at the front didn't say bye and only stared at us rudely.  I'm not impressed and for a $16 pizza before tax so $21 after tax and tip, I don't think it's worth it.",1.0

"Came in to buy a lock and a rack, was able to leave the bike there for about an hour and have the rack assembled for me for a small fee. Very helpful guys in the shop and I didn't feel any judgement from them considering I was bringing in my moms old mountain bike that she gifted to me recently - i wouldn't even be mad if they did. And as any good business, they pointed out a couple items to fix, which I plan to return to have them work on!",1.0
"I walked in just as they were closing after driving an hour there.  A man came up to me and said they had closed but when I explained to him that I just needed to walk through and knew exactly what to pick out but all I needed was the order number for my installer he said ""come on in"" very nicely. He pointed me to a woman behind a counter (who I assume is the one not answering the calls when I had called earlier on my way to find out what time they closed.....it just rang and rang). She looked at me with a blank stare and said ""we are closed"". I explained that the man let me in...yada yada yada. She looked at him and said ""you help her then"" and he politely said ""I can't I am with a customer"" then the two of them began to bicker which made me feel very uncomfortable.  Then, he came up to me and handed me a hard hat and piece of paper and quickly gave me instructions on how to get the information I needed. I walked in and headed right where I needed to be. About 2 mins later another woman came up to me and said ""miss...do you know we are closed?"" to which I explained again and she was rude on that she seemed annoyed and wouldn't look at me and briskly walked away. I then saw the slab I wanted and asked her a question about it (she was nearby) and she was being very passive aggressive with me and once again recommended I just go ahead and an appointment. I got so frustrated I simply said ""no thank you"" and walked out. 

I was too much trouble and they were rude about it. Bottom line.

"The place is good and the hotel rooms are also great. What I did not like about the whole thing was they tricking us into a 'timeshare presentation'. They will just tell you that you need to fill a 'survey' and there is a free brunch and some gifts. Well, the gifts are not really 'free' gifts, its discounted show tickets in Vegas. So spending 3 hrs on this 'timeshare presentation' (they take you around the resort to sell their timeshare property) for a free brunch and tickets, don't make sense at all! All my friends and I were so irritated by the end of it. They do not tell how long the whole thing will take, and one would never guess a 'survey' taking 3 hrs to say no to it.

"The guy who took my order was extremely friendly and pleasant, as for the girl at the counter who I picked it up from? Not so much. The pizza was pretty good, a slight crisp on the bottom, no thick crust on the edges. I think the toppings could have covered the sauce a little better especially since I ordered extra cheese and there was nothing extra about it. Also a little too much sauce for my taste. Overall though it was good and I would likely order again. If they were a little more generous with the toppings (especially when the customer pays for extra) they could give Geraci's a run for their money.",1.0
"I thought I had experienced a good cut of meat until I went here.  

I'm not big on atmosphere but if I'm going to pay for a nice meal, then it matters.  This place has a perfect old-school leather and wood boardroom feel.  The menu is simple- steak, seafood and sides.  No trendy fusion fare with unicorn horn or rainbow dust.  This place simply serves the best meats with best ingredients and meticulous preparation.  The sides were basic but tasty and perfectly complimented the entre.  

Yes, it's a franchise but it's a damn good one.  It's not cheap however the quality and service make it worthwhile.  The only problem is that it practically ruined me for other steak houses.

"My friend who was visiting from the US asked me if we could get some Canadian delicacies. And yes, the first place I thought of was the Maid's cottage.

They are gooey and crunchy at the same time!!

The restaurant itself is a cute little place located on the historic Main street of Newmarket. They also serve up some delicious breakfast food. The seating is very limited though. The staff here are very friendly and just wonderful to talk to.

Cool mix of modern decor and hipster peeps, Captain Planet playing on the flat screens. I honestly came here for the cool latte art, but the food was just as good!  had salmon eggs benedict that came w\/ a side of fruit, potatoes, & also ordered waffles w\/ jam\/whipped cream. Wish we tried a smoothie cause I think it was named after Celine Dione, haha. We also saw so many people ordering the breakfast poutine which looked amazeballz.

"OMG. This place seriously gave me the best pizza I ever ate. My family decided to stop by after discovering that Pizzeria Bianco was on a ""Must-Try Pizza"" List. We ordered a Margherita Pizza to-go and while we waited, we were served some bread and olive oil. Now I've had my share of olive oil before and this stuff was FRESH. Like freshly pumped out of the olives fresh. It was light and refreshing and absolutely delicious. The pizza itself was so thin and delicious with the fresh basil and the thin crust. Soooo good.

Everything is made fresh so you cannot call in your order and pick it up in 20 minutes. You will have to go and order in person and wait. But it's SUPER quick. Just go and enjoy some bread while you wait. You will not be disappointed. =]

"I've been here a few times, and as far as dry cleaners go, it's nothing special.  People go to dry cleaners because they are either cheap or convenient, so they're a dime a dozen.  I can't tell the difference between shirts cleaned at one place or another.

Having said that, this place leaves me a bit unsettled when I've been there in the past.  Never walked in and had someone greet me in a friendly, professional way.  Usually it seems like I'm tearing someone away from something more important. 

This is also the only dry cleaner I've been to where they ask you to pay up front --- I know that seems weird, but every other place in Steele Creek, South Park, University area and Ballantyne I've been to asks for payment after they've delivered your clothes to you.

One really frustrating thing about this place - other than getting a weird feeling like I'm not wanted when I go in there - is this place doesn't put it's name or phone number on the receipt. The first time I went there, I didn't go back to get my stuff until about a week later. I checked my receipt for a phone number so I could call to make sure they weren't going to be closed when I got there to get my shirts.  At the time I was taking some of my cleaning to a couple places, depending on my errands for that week and where I was going to be.  No number.  No business name.  Nothing to distinguish this receipt from any other dry cleaner in the area, so I was puzzled for a little while --- where the heck did I drop off my cleaning?   Kind of weird, but more than anything just pretty inconvenient.  I have hundreds of names and phone numbers in my phone, but I didn't have this one in my address book yet, and you might think that might be a good piece of information to have on there.",1.0
"Ok - I have read other reviews and YES the food was good but heck after 45 mins waiting for a table and then another 45 minutes at the table waiting for food... well our taste buds were diminished, maybe it was the dry mouth we suffered waiting endlessly for refills, or the lack luster wait staff, common one girl was in short shorts that should never be on someone her size (puked in my mouth).  Its the kind of place people go to just because they went in Cali or CO.  If you have no place to be and want to wait hours for OK breakfast then this is the place for you!

"My review is the only one you need to read. This is a good breakfast buffet. Wicked Spoon is better. The Bellagio buffet has really gone down-hill, don't even bother. If you have to do a buffet then either this one or Wicked Spoon is the way to go.  I can't believe I got suckered into going to the Paris buffet which I know is awful, and there's a long line like they're giving it away for free (they're not). Luckily I'm a diamond status Harrah's member so I don't wait.   

I digress.  My favorite 3 breakfast places in Vegas are Bouchon at the Venetian, Bacchanal at Caesar's, Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, and a little diner on Fremont with the best darn diner food ever. Can't remember it's name but it's on the end of Fremont and had the original phone number ""1"" you can figure it out. Best pancakes etc.....",1.0
"Tried a variety of things here and overall everything tasted okay but nothing really stood out.

Guava coconut and Pomegranate Lychee drinks at $5 each - more like an exotic fruit slushie but tasted pretty good.

Chicken\/beef satay at $13 for 6 pieces - the peanut sauce it came with was amazing but the size of the skewers could have used an upgrade.

Chicken roti for $8.50 and $2 for each additional flat bread - really small portion but very tasty and still pretty good value for the $8.50. I still thought the sauce was missing a little something. Maybe a little spiciness would have given it some extra kick.

Pad Thai for $8 - nice decent size shrimps. The sauce had a sweet flavor to it and once again dish is on the smaller size but good value for $8.

Pineapple fried rice for $7.50 - more of the same once again. 

Mango pudding $6 - the mango was an actual mango and not the pudding I was expecting and it was a really sour mango. Don't recommend.

Sago dessert $5 - don't know what to say about this one but I really didn't like this dessert either and do not recommend. 

Coconut rice pudding $5 - loved the sweet coconut shavings. My favorite dessert of all the ones I tried.

Das Essen war toll, keine riesigen Portionen, aber auch nicht mini Zeug auf dem Teller. Ich hatte davor noch nie diese Mischung aus Flammkuchen und Calzone gegessen, war toll. Der Wein, den es dazu gab auch.

Wir saßen übrigens unten in der Cantina, da sieht es am modernsten aus, und ruhig war es auch. Als wir später beim Gehen durch den Hauptraum gekommen sind war der knallvoll und entsprechend laut und rummelig, mehr Stehtische und so. Hatte eine tolle Atmosphäre, italienisch halt. Im Obergeschoss gibt es noch mehr Tische mit richtigen Stühlen, da geht es wohl etwas geruhsamer zu.

All that annoyance aside, the pizza is actually good but you're definitely getting ripped off as a slice will run you a cool $5+ depending on toppings.

"This is disgusting. And I am not just talking about the food. Everything. First off, disgustingly greasy. Took one bite, and a waterfall of butter and grease poured out of my burger. Couldnt do it. I ate the fries - decent but nothing special. Got up to get napkins. No where to be found. Had to ask for napkins?! They are too cheap to have napkins readily available? Its definetly not for environmental reasons as this place doesnt even have recycle bins. When I asked if there was a recycling bin for our cans, she instructed me to throw then in the garbage. 

Anyhow, went back to my seat - actually I think it was a foot stool - to watch my friend struggle through his burger. He ate half and tossed it too. Why do people eat this crap? I wasnt expecting to eat healthy, or even clean for that matter - but this is next level raunchy. Everything from the food, seating and service was just dumb. Worst $25 spent in my life. Big Smoke Burger is way better. The look of the restaurants, the food, the service - way better. Even Macdonalds is nicer.

The downsides are many, unfortunately. The decor is beyond dated and not particularly clean. We asked to use a table in the corner as our group got larger and the owner sternly told us we were not allowed. That table sat empty all evening.

Instead of running a tab and letting as pay up at the end of the night, as every other pub in town does, the owners stand over you and demand payment the instant they put your drink in front of you. My husband ordered food and had to pay before it even showed up. It was as if the owners thought we were all going to bolt out the door without paying the moment their backs were turned.",1.0

"Luckily we learned about the small taco shop on Groupon. We drove past the Glendale location and we thought it was closed. Had to call to double check the hours. Once we walked in, we were greeted by the manager or owner, very welcoming. He offered us some chips and guacamole. Came to find out there was no refill on chips and we had to pay for the guacamole...  I would have liked to enjoyed some chips throughout my meal, not just the first 10 minutes. Me and my boyfriend don't drink soda, so he offered a drink we took water. He brought us the water, but in a PLASTIC CLEAR CUP. Like the ones Circle K gives you. However the tacos we ordered were AMAZING. I had the Carne Asada street tacos. They were delicious. We ate and talked. about 20 minutes later, still no waiter for a refill. I had to get up and walk to the bar for more water. Finally the check comes... we paid in cash and we had decided what the tip was going to be. The change came and the waiter\/manager\/owner took some of the change as his tip...

"This has got to be one of the worst Wal-Mart's I have ever been to. My friend just moved to this neighborhood so we decided to go to this Wal-Mart so he could get some items for his new home. It was late, around 11:40PM. We needed to get some things from electronics but when we got to that department we realized they had it blocked off. We asked what was going on and they told us that their location now shuts down electronics at 11PM. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! THIS IS WAL-MART! The point of having a 24 hour location is for convenience. They even had the makeup department shut down too. 

Which brings me to why I'm giving this location 2 stars instead of 1. I went up to an employee (SWEETEST MAN EVER!) and ask if he would let me go into the makeup department and get the face lotion that I had primary came to Wal-Mart for. This employee knew he shouldn't and even stated he wasn't suppose to, YET he still allowed me to go in there and get the lotion I came for. The fact that he risked getting in trouble to help me find what I needed blew my mind. That man deserves to work for a better company, a company that appreciates their employees that actually care about their customers. That's what I consider going the extra mile. HE DESERVES A RAISE! I wish I knew his name, all I know is that he was restocking the lotion when I approached him and he told me he just got back from vacation so he wasn't entirely certain why they had shut down those departments at 11PM.

There was a family who jumped in line but they took notice and made sure we were seated first. We got our drinks very quickly and the waitress gave us refills before we even asked. There was a nice variety for breakfast. They had meat, salads, fruit, an omelet station, and your typical breakfast food. They also had a good amount of desserts for it being a breakfast buffet. They had cupcakes, cake, and their soft serve machine was on. 
Someone in the party has a nut allergy and this was one of the better buffets for that. Note: it is not deadly, but it is present. They only had two items with nuts that I saw. One was with the toast and croissants and another was in a separate dessert section with cake and pudding-type desserts. This was amazing to see, since many buffets have tree nut items spread throughout the buffet.
This is also an easy buffet for those in wheelchairs. They had tables, not just booths, and the aisles and walkways were wide enough for a wheelchair.",1.0

"What a spiritual, uplifting Catholic Community!

From the opening notes of the hymn, ""All are welcome in this place"", I knew how special Saint Patrick's was to me.

where love can dwell
And all can safely live,
A place where
saints and children tell
How hearts learn to forgive.""

There are so many things I want to share about coming here for 5 pm Mass. First is coming into their sacred space and hearing a first class Choir and musicians practicing . Their group also includes a pianist, a person on Keyboard and a very young College age drummer.  They were great, and not just for the practice, but throughout the service. They all worked well together and didn't overwhelm the senses. The music of Paul Hillebrand and the heavenly voice of their Cantor Jill Bagshaw are incredible and needs to be experienced to be appreciated.  

""Let us build a house where prophets speak,
And words are strong and true,
Where all God's children dare to seek
To dream God's reign anew.""

Second is the friendly parishioners who sat around me, including some long time friends. Even though Father Eric was away on vacation, the folk at Saint Patrick's didn't seem to miss a beat. Their ministry to the poor of spirit here in the valley is well known, particularly their efforts at Justa Center.  But it's also the nearly four dozen other ministries, where they offering themselves as the hands and body of Christ, which makes you realize how special this community is.

""Let us build a house where love is found
In water, wine and wheat:
A banquet hall on holy ground,
Where peace and justice meet.""

I've come to Mass here many times and the Liturgy is wonderful. I have never felt this way in any other Catholic Church.  It is so moving, to stand up and have the entire church hold hands for The Lord's Prayer, and I do mean everyone. It's special and I only wish I could convey how moving it is to feel the spirit in this church when it happens. It's just amazing to have over five hundred members standing, holding hands and reciting not a prayer by rote, but with feeling and love that makes it so special.

This place has been awful since day #1 I don't not have all the time in the world to list everything or problem that have occurred including the roach that is on half way under the ceiling fan in the front room to the water being shut off every other week due to a apartment issue that Heaven call a water main break. I have never seen so many roaches in my life. The front desk staff is very rude after you sign your lease they don't care cause you are stuck in a contracted agreement. The staff give your apartment keys to outside agency's to come in your apartment alone to spray for bugs even after you tell them not to allow anybody into your apartment. The washer\/dryer that is in the unit is low budget and do not work rite it only run up your bill. Dog shit is everywhere cause the owners barely clean up after their pets.

"Two major concerns regarding Ronnow Lawn Sprinkler Inc: 

1) The technician arrived an hour after his scheduled window.  He was supposed to show up between 11am and 1pm and arrived at 2pm.  I finally had to call at 1pm to find out if he was still coming. 

2) The Ronnow technician was quick to ascertain I needed an entirely new control panel for my sprinkler system.  I was on lunch break, didn't have a lot of time, and agreed because the panel was old and my grass was dying.  The total repair cost was $340 for the panel and 15 minutes of his time to repair it.

Once I had time to research it, I discovered the average cost of a standard control panel is $75. The technician installed a ""commercial grade"" panel for my shrubs ($200) Completely unnecessary. 

If you decide to use this company, take a moment to price-check the parts and be clear on the cost of labor. 

My brother is a master mechanic in CA.  He advised me I shouldn't have paid more than $150 TOTAL for this repair.  Good luck and try another company.",1.0
"Last year I had them come out and fix AC when it was broken. They will send their white knights out if system isn't working; otherwise, it's a lackie. System was fixed and I was talked into a maintenance contract. 

This year I had them back to due a maintenance check. This time they sent a guy who was pretty new. He called his boss 3 or 4 times to check on things. He replaced a connector\/contractor part for $248!!!! He said system was low on Freon and charged $140 for 1 lb. He also said my TXV value was bad in the attic and it would be $1200 to replace it. I told him no way. Wife and I were talked into another service contract for 7 years at like $1000. Because we bought the maintenance contract the repairs were discounted. So a simple maintenance call that shouldn't have cost me anything now had me at $1092.

Called a second company, Ultimate Air LLC, out for another opinion.  Only cost me $79. They said the connector\/contactor part wasn't bad. If it was their cost to replace it was $169 not $248 like Alaskan. Also told me I could get the part at Home Depot for $30 and do it myself if I'm handy.

They said Freon level looked good. Their Freon cost was like $30\/lb. Also told me that the TXV valve was fine and didn't need replacing.

Guy told me companies like Alaskan Home Services create a sense of urgency to get you to think you need their service contract. He said every time they come out for a maintenance check they will find something wrong to keep their hands in your wallet.

He told me when the AC is out they send the white knight and it's the guy that knows what he's doing; otherwise, it someone that is new to the business. Well I guess that's true since the tech at my house had to keep calling the boss.

I called and talked with their service manager Art to demand a reduction in price. Didn't happen. He told me he wasn't going to apologize for their high prices either.

I cancelled my maintenance contract and got a refund.

Stay away from them unless you want to over pay for parts and service.",1.0
"My favorite hotel in Las Vegas hands down (next to Aria which is a close second). I'm a 20-something professional woman and this is perfect for girls and guys like me!

"I was very happy to see that a Panera opened in Phoenix. Panera was my favorite restaurant back in Michigan where I'm from, so I was glad to try it out. 

The food is good and while I agree the price is a little high, it is comparable from what I remember. The problem is the service. It seems like the staff has no idea what they're doing and they get easily confused. While I was waiting for my takeout, they had to ask what I had. It took nearly 10 minutes to get my Chicken Caesar Salad, and the restaurant was slow. I suppose they were growing the lettuce from my salad from the garden because it took so long.

"About a week ago, I just got off work from a long day and thought I needed some time to relax. I remembered my best friend who told me that this place was amazing to get your nails done. So getting there... I was trying to follow the directions with Siri when finding this place, and it kept saying it was near the gas station at the end of the street? Then after 15 minutes, I finally found it. It doesn't even say Diva Nails Spa at all!!! Just NAILS. 

So I got there around 6 pm, an hour before they closed. I walked in and I'm guessing the owner (male) was on his computer and greeted me. I told him I wanted just a manicure. I'm pretty sure I said it really loud and clear. He then yelled for his tech to come in and start on my nails. I was browsing at their colors and noticed she was turning on the water from the pedicure station. I then said ""oh no, it's just a manicure"" His face looked pissed off\/irritated and rolled his eyes. I felt like that was really rude and just to be NICE, I decided to do both since he quoted me $33. (I rarely get my nails done so I thought this was a decent price) 

An older lady, I'm guessing her name is Julie? She was really nice, but during my pedicure, I felt as if she was rushing, especially at the end.

Now with my manicure, I decided to do gel nails. She quoted me $52. My nails looked very un-even and not shiny. The color was not even the right shade. I asked for a bright teal color and even showed her a picture I liked from one of their designs I saw on Yelp. I even asked her if she can do an accent nail. She told me ""No, no we can't, one color is nicer"". At this point, I was pretty much over it and ready to leave. I was the only one there. It was very awkward since the male owner never acknowledged me during my time there, only when I left to pay. 
He only had a conversation to the other ladies before me. Also, another male tech who was there, kept face-timing his family or whoever he was talking to with his iPad. I think that is very unprofessional...please do that on your break and not to the public eye.

"This sushi joint looks and smells great but I left highly unimpressed. The waitress was flat with no personality, no time management, and said little to nothing. Most of her time was spent in the service well talking to some stereotypical ""bros"". The shrimp tempura roll was labeled $5.75 but we were charged $8.50. I wanted to bring this to the attention of our waitress but I couldn't chew and swallow fast enough to say something before she'd drop and run. The tempura roll was bland and made sloppily. However, the sushi rice was made perfectly, it was sticky and just a little sweet. Both the fried rice and yakisoba noodles were drenched in sesame oil and were only enjoyable after a liberal application of Sriracha. For $64, bad service, and just okay food I won't return and do not recommend this place.",1.0

"I really wanted to like this place because I love a great steak! My wife and I made reservations for date night (we are locals) and we set the reservation for an earlier time (6:30) to beat the rush. when we arrived we looked for a parking space and all of them were blocked off for valet parking. We then proceeded to the back parking and again blocked off except for 40 or so spaces which were filled by what i would say was the staff. We had to park next door in the strip mall because I do not trust the valet to drive my truck, we then had to scale a 3 foot wall to get to the front door. We  went inside and were seated promptly as there was only a few customers inside. Once I saw the amount of staff standing around watching us be seated I understood the parking situation, I counted at least 17 waiters not to mention the support staff and kitchen help. Now for the service, the waiter was prompt but understanding his accent was difficult. We ordered our meal and asked for water to drink. The waiter then placed our order and came back to us and asked if we were Mormon I explained to him we don't drink and drive and we were not Mormon just responsible. Our meal came and it was mediocre the steaks were good but not $50 plus good per steak.

I chose the ""Officer's Choice"" because I wanted to give their roast beef the taste test. It passed! Great flavor! I love how thin they slice the meat and red onions. I also love that they keep the cheese a bit thicker. Every ingredient seemed as fresh as it gets. However, I don't recommend paying the extra $1.25 for avocado. The cashier gave us the disclaimer when I ordered ""extra charge, is a pulp spread.."" I still went for it. It didn't add anything but more mess on my fingers.

"My Parents are retired, honest seniors, that have always loved driving Hondas.  They have been saving for a while and have had their eye on the CRV.  Well the day finally came for them on 12\/5\/14.  My Dad, is a very modest man.  He's quite frugal, especially when it comes to buying a new car.  No need for all the bells and whistles! Everyone knows that Dealership Salesmen and Business Managers are pushy and pushy until they get that sale.  They treat you nice, crack jokes, the works....to get that sale.  The Business Manager makes that sale happen.  If you don't qualify by having a credit union, no worries, a Costco card works too. No worries, they will make your payment the number you want.  My Dad was asked if he wanted the extra warranty, he said ""NO"".  He was asked about a few other extras, my Dad said ""NO"".  But they will make it work! Finally...Contract signed, sealed papers delivered in hand. A few days later, my Dad is at the insurance company and notices that he after saying ""NO"" to the Vehicle Contract, was still charged $2200.00.  Also, a theft deterrent system was charged, but not installed for $995.00. That is a lot of money for my parents, even if it's broken down to monthly payments.  They are seniors on a very tight fixed budget.  I think the worst part of this is, the attitude and denial when speaking to the Business Manager, CORY CALDARAZZO and the Salesman, Michael Douglas.  I personally called to speak to Cory on the phone and told him that their had been a mistake.  He first said, "" Well, I can't make changes with you over the phone because you are not on the contract.  You can come in so that we can fix things and take care of it.""  My husband ended up leaving work early from Scottsdale, to meet my parents at the dealership and to speak with Cory.  Well, it turns out Cory is just a BULLSHITER! Their is absolutely nothing they can do at the dealership to make changes. It was just a HUGE waste of time.  What aggravates me the most, is that my Parents are in their 70's, spent the entire day worried sick, then left the dealership very upset.  That isn't the way to treat Seniors or just plain PEOPLE!  Why can't they just be HONEST from the beginning and earn their money the right way.  I'm very upset and disappointed that my parents have had the JOY of a new car ripped out from under them.

That is also where the smorgasbord of a salad buffet can be fount. It had over a dozen choices to choose from including many varieties of vegetables, beans, pasta and dressings. You could get full off the salad alone.

I had the ""Kartoffelsahnesuppe"" (creamed potato soup with slices of salmon) as a starter and it was delicious. It was perfectly creamy in texture and had a wonderfully strong yet not too strong flavor.

The ""Lachsfiletspitzen"" was soft and covered with a creamy hollandaise sauce was made well. The accompanied balls of I believe what was Rotsi were lightly crisp, fresh and also good.

Everyone enjoyed the food, which was FABULOUS. We also came on a Thursday, which was 1\/2 price wings (6 grilled BBQ or habenero wings for $3). My favorite things would be the ribs (which has dry-rub - once you try dry rub, you won't go back to sticky fingers from heavy BBQ sauce) and the mac&cheese (absolute perfection when mixed with BBQ sauce). The drinks were also decently priced and had a great selection.

"Went here on a weekend to pick up some lunch. The restaurant is attached to a mall which makes you think it might have more of a laid back vibe to it, but no, walk through the doors and everybody be wearing suits and dresses. FANCY. I actually put some effort into my attire that day but still felt a bit out of place. Oh well, placed our order then hit the mall while we waited. At home we opened up the goods and this is what we got...

-Chicken Pot Stickers: Been there, done that. The thinly sliced cucumber on top was a nice touch though. 
-Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup: Tasted okay even after being in the fridge a few days. Glad to find 6 medium sized shrimp in it. 
-Chicken Cheesecake: Stay away from this. Dry and had a lifeless flavor to it. The side of thick cut sweet potato fries were good though, I think they were tempura fried. 
-Sauteed Sea Scallops: Very good! Only had 3 scallops but the meal was just so creamy and tasty it didn't even matter. A little black pepper and my mouth was pretty happy eating that. 
-Creme Brulee: A delicious end to our tasting that day. Crispy sugary crust with a smooth custard and chopped up fruit that really paired well with it.

"Nice Thai ...

Trying to expand my that experience I tested the lemongrass soup, bean thread noodle salad. And crab Rangoon or fried wonton.

"My first Luna's experience was on Fat Tuesday- kind of ironic. We stopped in for take-out last night, much needed after a very foodie Mardi Gras weekend in New Orleans. 

So, everything is vegan, raw and ""living"" if you will. A lot of options for interesting dishes- we had the falafel trio and I ordered the Divinity Bowl. Interesting to see ""cauliflower rice."" Not enough curry flavor in the mix of vegetables- the sauce was at the bottom and it was minimal. The falafel was much more flavorful... I especially liked the vegetables that came with it, had an interesting bite to them. I'm no stranger to vegan or raw restaurants, and while the food was good, it wasn't the best I have ever had.

I do wish they had fresh juice- all the juice is in pre-packaged bottles- which seems impractical for an earth-friendly place. Apparently they don't accept old glass bottles, either. In my opinion, skip the bottles and go for a biodegradable cup, or better yet, put fresh juice in said cup. As a marketer I get the branding aspect, but I'm sure the customers are left with dozens of glass bottles that they don't know what to do with... although I have no idea why anyone would repeatedly spend $10 on a bottle of pre-packaged juice. I'd rather go to Earth Fare and get one fresh for $5.",1.0
"Yellow Rose is one of the rare bars in Charlotte that has a somewhat divey feel.  The atmosphere is very laid back and reminiscent of bars in blue collar towns.  I wouldn't say it's a true dive as the place actually appears overall clean.  While we didn't have the food, the bar service was fast and friendly, even on a busy Saturday night.  They have some great beer specials if you like the mass produced domestic stuff. Chubby's Karaoke also makes for a great time.  They also have several pool tables, but they are always busy. Fun place.",1.0
"One of my favorite lunch spots in the city.  

I've heard other say ""stay away from the sushi,"" so, I have, however, their hibachi is delicious and incredibly inexpensive for the quantity & quality of food you receive.  ~$8 for a small basic salad (nothing special), cup of soup (ok), and a GIANT platter of hibachi meat, veggies and rice.  Really really good.  Never too crowded in my experiences during normal lunch hours.  Staff are pleasant but not overly talkative.

"I just stopped in Thorps this evening for another haircut, this time with Quinley. Totally pleased! In fact, I scheduled my next cut with Quinley before I left. 

Even though I was mostly in for a trim, we talked about the heaviness of my thick hair and she made a big difference in lightening up the layers in my near-shoulder length bob. 

My last cut at Thorps was with Tara and she really cleaned up a grown out, trendier cut into a clean bob. She understood how to smooth the layers in my straight, yet thick hair so everything looked polished for the next couple of months. A stylist who works well with thick hair is a special find and now I've found two at Thorps! After blowing it out she carefully went back over bits that might be prone to flipping outward. We talked a bit about her preferences and I would highly recommend her for anyone looking for a beachy\/boho hairstyle - this woman definitely has a passion for voluminous waves, sea salt spray, and highlights. 

All in all, I love Thorps for these reasons: 
1. Great vibe - it's classy but laid back and the space is so roomy, I find it much more relaxing than your average salon. 
2. Price - it varies by stylist of course but I can get a reasonable price on a great haircut. I certainly believe in paying for quality but, as a woman paying for upkeep cuts on a fairly simple hairstyle, I appreciate that Thorps has some stylists who aren't so veteran as to be out of my price range. My haircut today was $30 and I left my last salon when prices creeped above $45 per cut. 
3. Product - they're obviously very choosey about the product they carry, use, and recommend. It all smells amazing, always a perk. 
4. Hours - in my book it's a huge plus to schedule a later cut, and enjoy a PBR with it.
5. Service - the people here are always helpful and generally friendly although sometimes a little cold. What's that about anyway?

"This is just not my kind of place. When you walk in, it's immediately sensory overload. There is stuff EVERYWHERE- hanging from the ceiling, all over the floor, and racks and racks of dusty clothes. There is a bunch of food at the front that looks good enough, but the place is so dusty, dark, and dirty feeling that despite how hungry I am, I'm never tempted. They give you free popcorn and tea samples when you walk in, which are decent enough but I just don't enjoy eating in an environment like this. 

You can rent costumes downstairs but the ceiling is extremely low and it smells even worse down there. I went down there this year to browse Halloween costume ideas but very quickly had to come upstairs because I started feeling extremely claustrophobic. 

I also brought a large bag of clothes here to sell once, most of which were in really good shape. The bag was probably at least 10lbs and for all those good quality clothes, they gave me $5. To be honest, I was quite offended because most of my stuff was definitely nicer than what was on the racks.

The door was never fixed, and we even fixed the kitchen counters that were coming up.  After we moved out they charged us for all the stains on the carpet even though it was noted most were there prior.  I had to call 5 times (they kept saying they would call me back  and never did).

"Horrible.  i caught bloat early on and rushed to our vet who decompressed his stomach and saved his life. He recommended this place to monitor him and possibly surgery if needed. Vet on staff they said surgery was definitely needed. They first gave us quote, vet said it wouldn't be more than 2k since we caught it early, but that we had to sign an estimate for 2.8k-4k, jus for wiggle room but he assured us it would be less than 2k. Well the bill came to 3,100 saying they had to remove the spleen (which was itemized at ($458 and they didn't tell us why they needed to remove it).  Whenever I called to see how my dog was doing i was on hold for long periods of time and then told to call back after-hours, since they had no update.  This is a dog who just underwent surgery and they were supposed to be monitoring him! i felt as though they don't care about their patients at all,.  They make you sign an estimate with a low and high end and then try to suck as much out of you.  I called several emergency vets afterwards and received a rate that was 1\/3 what we were charged and I am sure my dog would have been monitored more carefully.  The discharge papers were incomplete.  I had told the surgeon he was on Rimadyl and he told us to hold off and would write in the discharge papers when he could start again on it, well nothing was in there.  I called the next morning to ask and was on hold, hung up and and treated rudely. DO NOT EVER TAKE YOUR PETS HERE.",1.0
"We felt like Thai food for dinner so I decided to take a chance and order from Thai Cuisine Experts - which I ended up regretting.  We ordered chicken pad Thai and chicken green curry.  WE WAITED AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR OUR FOOD - I called several times and each time the person picking up the phone reassured me the driver (also the owner) would be there in a few minutes - only for another 40 minutes to go by. When the driver\/owner finally arrived, he told me I waited almost two hours because ""the roads were bad"" ...considering our food arrived at 7:40pm and the restaurant is about 10 minutes away, this excuse was just  unrealistic.

As we were sitting there, we noticed so many health code violations, including seeing the workers go in and out to the patio, touching money and plates of food without washing their hands.

We weren't the only ones who were disappointed with the service. Another customer actually came in and had a loud dispute with the manager about the wait time. What did the manager do? She chuckled! Wow! Then she told him to get out and never come back instead of offering to fix the problem. Finally one of the police officers in the restaurant had to break it up and told the couple to leave. 

When we got our food, we immediately checked it to find out the fries were COLD. At this point we were confused because we already waited 20 minutes to place our order and 45 minutes for our food, yet the fries were cold. Once I pointed it out to the server, it took another 3 minutes to make a fresh batch. How does that make sense? Not to mention they did ask us for payment before giving us the food... shady!

1x Cupcake of the month (pretty much chocolate overload)
1x cookie cupcake

Intentional or not, everything is way too safe here. Not much flavor. Did not register even faint blips on the savoriness radar.  

Pacing was horrendous. I'm willing to bet it was more the tiny kitchen than the serving staff (who were super nice). There seemed to be a ton of take out orders so maybe they have to make tough decisions. Whatever the Thai equivalent of those Sesame Inn crunchy noodles might not be the worst idea to tide people over. I also feel immeasurable pity for anyone who has to use the restroom here, as literally every single person in the restaurant will watch you walk in and walk out. Maybe they should convert to take out only or try to rent out the rest of the building they're in.",1.0
"Overrated. Supposedly best dance club on the planet. 
Pros:
1. Very good DJ, music selection, lights, and sounds.
2. Beautiful architecture and views.
3. Many beautiful ladies. 
Cons:
1. Dance floor is too small so it got too crowded. 
2. People keep bumping you while walking in\/out of crowded floor. Breaks your rhythm. 
3. Many people just stand\/walk. This is a Dance club; Not a Stand club. If you're not dancing, please go to pool area. Here people can listen to each other, introduce themselves, and then decide to dance. If not, there are plenty of fish in the sea.
4. Management denied access to outdoor pool area to get fresh air, talk, and maybe dance outside. 
5. Bouncers\/Security are rude. If you will deny access, apologize, state the reason, and smile. You only need to get tough After people don't respond to reason. Being rude is not a good Customer Service trait.

I was so excited to try them so we popped in for lunch.  It wasn't overly busy which makes me happy i don't have to wait in line.  We were seated immediately with Brandon, our waiter, over in a flash.  They have a wide range of menu items.  Luckily on Monday's their appetizers, burgers and pizza are half price ALL DAY!  Big smiles all around!  So of course I went with the Blue Cheese Bacon Burger but started off with their onion rings appetizer.  

The onion rings were absolutely perfect.  Crispy and light breading hugged the ever so tasty onion.  A heavenly chipotle ranch dipping sauce accompanied the appetizer which had just enough kick to keep my taste buds popping!  Can you tell I loved them?  But wait, I'm not done....

Still happy about my burger being half price, I was anxiously waiting to devour it.  I always order my burger medium so it has just enough pink.  And the judges give it a 10!  It was perfectly cooked.  Not to mention the crispy bacon, onion straws and sautéed mushrooms sitting pretty on the burger.  I would order that again and again.

You have to be open to the real deal here! Lebanese at its finest! No fake American altered cuisine! You get to watch them prepare your food fresh too! The food case was so beautiful in the center of it all that I had a hard time deciding what to order! Lol! 

I over heard someone not happy with their dish and the server was extremely accommodating to replace it for them right away! I could tell it was the flavor and not the dish!!!!! Remember, you have to have the palette for authentic cuisine! This is no run of the mill place!  

The owner went out of his way to greet us. Since my daughter frequents the place, they were very attentive, but I noticed that all the guest are treated that way too! I loved the flavors of my food so much that I had to score a container of spice to bring back to Arizona! They have a small selection of items you can purchase and the staff will educate you on how to use them. I've used this particular spice, not sure the name of it, the tag came off during my travels, on everything from my morning eggs to my chicken, fish and of course LAMB! Wow! 

Lastly, it is a great place for inside or outside seating, large or small groups except call ahead for parties over 10 so they can accommodate you accordingly. Great place for the family! The granddaughter was happy at the young age of 2 1\/2 yrs old!

Seems to be ideal for catering, but not sure if they offer that. Just ask!

"Truly awful place, so much so I've sought it out for a review. 

I forget the bartender's name, but I wish I hadn't. He should have been fired on the spot with what I saw.

Saturday night, me and two of my friends wanted to use our $20 coupon for drinks. There's a total of 5 people other then us at the bar. Instead of serving us right away, the bartender is cleaning up every empty bottle on the bar. No joke takes him 5 minutes to even recognize our presence.
When he finally acknowledges us, we order 3 domestic beers. After doing other stuff for a few minutes, he finally opens up 3 beers, we almost 10 minutes into being at a nearly empty bar, we have a drink in our hands. Unsurprisingly our $20 doesn't cover the bill. We still owe $3. I tip him $2 even though he doesn't deserve it. Whatever, overpriced drinks in Vegas, that is nothing new.

Well 2 minutes after we get our drinks a customer next to us is unhappy with a ""weak"" drink that the bartender made and he wants another one. With no other management in sight, the bartender completely loses his cool and says, ""I don't make any f'ing weak drinks. That's a bunch of bull s***."" They proceed to argue and we decide it's a good time to leave.

I smashed it into the floor and then went to the front desk and complained to one of the managers. The next day I went in to take a shower and I saw the guts were still smashed on the floor in there in the corner so they did not do anything about it.

The skinny 
I don't usually get coffee nor am I a big donut lover but my gf is so by default I frequent places like this. I never had a great experience here no one has ever wowed me which is ok I never expect it. The problem is they never seem to be average or ok with service I always seem to have one thing wrong with my order which is funny to me as usually order one thing med iced coffee with cream and 3 splendas (my gf's order) and they either give me no cream and 3 splendas or cream and 3 reg sugars. I never tell them I just fill out there survey in the back of receipt and let them know what's going on I'm sure I have left my share of bad remarks but nothing has changed, once the 99c coffee promo is up we will be going back to Starbucks although expensive, the baristas usually give u a smile and are friendlier (though not all).

To begin, appetizer:
Risotto cakes and potato soup. Both were very good. Lots of flavor. Both of us enjoyed the cakes aka little risotto balls more.

Entree:
I had the braised beef with mini potatoes, onions and carrots with creme fraiche. She had the salmon with crab and bacon polenta. Both were good but the braised beef was amazing! So yummy, I found myself wiping the bowl with my fork to get more sauce.

Desert;
I had the chocolate mousse and she had the berry cheesecake. Both of us agreed the mousse was the better of the two.

"I have been dealing with Laywines for years back in the day when I used a paper based system with the excellent Filofax product (Then I got the Palm Pilot and that was it for paper). Then Moleskine created the 2.0 version of a notepad and then meant we needed better pens beyond a BIC pen.

Somewhere down the line the Hipsters realized that having the right diary or notepad with the right pen became cool again. 

I have been trying to track down the discontinued Moleskine City Guide for Tokyo. These guides are perfect for extended trips to major cities with maps and areas to put planning details, jot notes, tourist details and restaurant info.

I called and left a voice mail and they returned it with a follow up to let me know they were out of stock and although they had other city guides, I was out of luck.

"My wife and I were in the area and had this place bookmarked for a while.  It's rare that a J-AYCE reviews are as swingy as Sakana but I was desperate for sushi.  I called them to ask if they were a Japanese owned and run restaurant (semi-important to my wife) and the lady on the other end said ""yes"" in a super annoyed teenager way like I asked if she was still going out with that guy she met while waiting in line for hot dog on a stick at the Meadows Mall food court last week.

Next thing you know...we see an all Korean staff, hear K-pop music in the air and I am all ""eff it, we're starving, let's eat"".  It was nice of them to keep all that Kabuki signage up to make the place easy to find :P  I am docking them a star just for that.  

We chose to eat at the sushi bar and our sushi chef was definitely one of the highlights of dinner.  He was personable, funny and asked us random questions throughout the evening like:

Chef: Did you just get married?
Us: No.  It's been over 6 years.
Chef:  Oh.  Just asking because you look happy.

Chef: Well why else would he take you here?

Chef asks me: Did you do something wrong to upset her?  Did you bring her here to apologize?  Maybe that's why you're here.
Me: (laughing) If I had to do that, we would be at a much more expensive place!

So on to the food.  They had an appetizer called ""The Shit"".  How could I not order this?  It was kind of a tempura fried California roll with some other ingredients I couldn't make out that came with a side of spicy mayo.  It was ok.  Foie gras wrapped in bacon...that would have been the shit.  

Their pork belly is the BEST I've had at any AYCE.  I had five orders of it.  I thought I was there for fish?

They have an amazing array of soups & it was delicious! Then, there's the desserts last and then the cashier. The food is so simple and so quick. It comes out right away! I ordered a half (a panini and soup) and it was less than $10! At the end, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry and bread. Knowing me...

"Overall, I would come back to catch the show but the food is nothing out of the ordinary. 

Location (5 stars): Located next to wicked spoon buffet on the second floor in the cosmopolitan.

Ambiance (5 stars): Whole restaurant set in 1920s gay atmosphere to incorporate a glimpse of the ""canto"" (show) with dinner. There are three different cantos nightly at 8pm, 10pm, 12am. The canto are about two hour long and cost ~$100 but the midnight showing is ~$30. Even though you are only here for dinner, an entertainment tax will be added to your bill since the canto start off in. There are many doors that lead to 6 different rooms. 

Food (3 stars): I had set high expectations for the food but rose.rabbit.lie did not deliver. The portions are indeed small since its tapas, but for the price to quality and taste ratio it was not worth the bang for the buck. We had caviar  taco, Brussels sprouts, Rockefeller oysters, rabbit fricassee, foie gras torchon, and I don't remember the name for dessert.

Caviar taco: World's smallest taco...1 taco about the size of a 1\/2 dollar for $15. Saltiness  from caviar mixed with freshness of the raw fish.  I would skip this unless you want to see something cute.

Brussels sprouts: I have been fond of this veggie and it was cooked to perfection.  Caramelized and accompanied with crispy chicken skin and cheese! If you are looking to add a veggie to your meal, this is your dish.

Rockefeller oysters: Nothing amazing comes to mind after trying one of these suckers which cost $4.50 each.

Rabbit: Personally, this dish was not for me. The rabbit was tender but the sauce was on the salty side.

Foie gras torchon: An interesting twist to foie gras. Cold foie gras accompanied with hot duck fat fries. Both portions melts in your mouth.


Service (3 stars): With a nice restaurant excellent service should be a bare necessity, but the restaurant did not deliver this also. It started out with seating us at our table. I had arrived early and was offered to with be seated or wait at the study bar. I opt to wait at the bar until my significant other arrive. We then waited for someone to seat us after our table was ready for about 15mins and no one ever called us. We had to ask about our table before we got seated. Our water glasses were never refilled and the waitress was occupied with too many patrons. She forgot one of our orders and it took a while for her take our order.",1.0

My fave:

YELLOWTAIL COLLAR: Super fatty full of flavor, slightly sweet with a smokey taste. All yellow tail and barely any collar bone.

SPICY POKE SALAD: sssooo good, refreshing, and light with slight kick to it. If you are looking for a light meal for lunch or dinner to pick at ala carte. This would be a fine choice (that is if you're choosing between the seaweed salad and the poke salad)

Kyle was such an amazing company the first time I came, and our waitresses (both times I came) were marvelous.

Kyle also gave us some of his famous ""secret lychee ice cream"" which unfortunately no longer a secret (sorry Kyle!). I asked for some the second time and it was nice of the waitress to check.

We stopped in to check it out and scored. This trendy little boutique is filled with many unique upscale accessories and clothes. I love jewelry that is different. This store has tons of beautiful affordable quality pieces for all types of taste. All jewels are neatly nestled on a display for easy access to try on. Plenty of mirrors on the wall to gaze and glance at the pieces as they lay on you. Now my friend was stocked about the clothing as she ran out with a full shopping bag of items she loved. What I really liked about the store is how neat and organized it was. Everything had a place and was easy to look through. The sales lady was super friendly.

"WARNING!  Horrible!!!  My boyfriend has been talking about this place since his visit to Vegas last year.  After our party of 3 was sat at a 2 top and asked to deal with it I was already annoyed.  After ordering and having our drinks brought to us, we were asked to stand up and move.  We initially thought ""Great! They are moving us to a larger table!""  Too bad that wasn't the case.  Instead they had us move to another to a 2 top table!!!! Are you kidding me?!?! Then after my boyfriend got his food he and finished 3 pops he found a dead fly embedded into his lemon.  They tried to claim it came in from outside and landed on their food therefore it's not their problem.  WTF kind of thinking is that?!?!!!! They refused to comp his food, and only offered to take it off his drink order.  Calling Health Department now!  We canceled my order before it even got to the table.",1.0

"Wollten eigentlich schon vor ein paar Wochen hier essen, da hatte der Laden aber geschlossen als wir kamen, obwohl wir 3 Tage vorher reserviert hatten?!

Heute wieder hier gewesen, Urteil: Totalausfall. Es hat schon damit angefangen dass wir in einem fast leeren Restaurant nicht unseren Tisch wählen durften, sondern wir mussten wieder aufstehen und uns an einen total dreckigen!! Tisch setzen, wo gibts denn sowas? Die Bedienung war sehr unfreundlich und konnte weder deutsch noch englisch. Es gab nicht wie sonst beim Inder die gratis Fladen als Vorspeise.

Waren mit einem Groupon-Gutschein hier für 4 Personen. Die vierte Person hat kurzfristig abgesagt. Mussten dann trotzdem 4 Essen bestellen, soweit so gut. Aber das vierte Essen plus Vorspeise mussten wir zu 50 % extra bezahlen. So macht man keine Werbung für sich!

Und hätte das alles nicht gereicht war das Essen auch noch ziemlich schlecht. Das Lamm war zäh, das Masala war null scharf, ebenso wie die ""scharfe"" soße die wir dann extra bestellt haben. Das Sikh war eigentlich nicht essbar, am besten war noch das Butter Chicken und die Vorspeisen. (Die waren aber frittierte Fertigware, da kann man nichts falsch machen)

Gewürzt war alles sehr lasch und lieblos, hat nichts mit indischer Küche zu tun meiner Meinung nach. Die Einrichtung ist schmutzig und versifft, ebenso wie die Toiletten.

"Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   

I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.

We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  

When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)
 
After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. 

The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.

No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school\/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).

FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.

I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.

There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.",1.0
"Ok, so finally on a plane and have some time to catch up on writing reviews.

So my partner and I recently road tripped up to Lake Chautauqua New York to spend some time with family and realized that Pittsburgh was on the way.  Having never visited Pittsburgh we thought we'd stop off for a night and check it out.  What a great city!  We were totally blown away and this restaurant was a big part of it.  This joint really hits on all cylinders!  The staff was welcoming and friendly, the drinks were extremely well crafted and the food and table service were divine.  We started with old fashioned's and a ""bees knees"" at the bar and were seated quickly for our 9:00 reservation ( yes this place is that popular).  We decided to stick to small plates and were rewarded handsomely!  The standouts from dinner were the brussel sprouts, steak tartare, and the ""pig candy"" (pork belly).  The brussel sprouts were crispy fried and absolutely drenched in butter and Parmesan cheese and the tartare was properly finished with an egg yolk.  The pork belly was decadent and not lost in the glaze that it was prepared in which was nice.  We were not disappointed by the wine list and truly had a wonderful evening here.

"I live in California and was in town visiting family.  This place sparked my interest being the only joint in Las Vegas on Yelp's Top 100 List.  I had to visit!

It is true-The owner Olivier takes his time to explain menu items if you have any questions.  I could feel that he loves being there.

We had the special of the day: The pork loin sandwich - tender slices of pork with a creamy sweet sauce, mushrooms, shaved parmesan, baby spinach and tomato on an extremely well made baguette (crispy crunchy exterior texture, soft interior).  Absolutely delectable.  The chocolate tart and pear tart were very delicious as well.  I'd like to come back to sample the quiche (they ran out) and the rest of the menu :-D.

No one seemed to know what they were doing and several times the person on the other side of the counter referred me to someone down the way.  You order your pizza at the first stop, sides etc at the next and then you get rung up.  They don't have a large selection of toppings and they don't seem to use premium ingredients.  Further, the antipasta salad was mostly lettuce and you couldn't even taste any flavor to the little bit of meat which was there.  The pizza had a burnt taste to it, more so than expected.",1.0
"My friend and I decided on a little preseason ""tailgating"" and came here for drinks and apps. As I walked in the door, I received some snobby looks from the host stand, but ignored it. The look was like ""what are you doing here"". Whatever. I found my friend at the bar and we caught up for a bit. It literally took them 8 minutes (I kept time) for them to acknowledge me and tell me the specials. After scanning the restaurant, I noticed some specials on their mirror from the other side of the room (no one told me about them). I ordered a peach and herbs drink (bourbon). The drink itself was good, but no real taste of peach, just bourbon. It was good, but I know I could've made a better one. My friend had a Southie she said was good.

We ordered the mussels with bread, fries and truffle aioli. Not kidding, about 1\/2 my mussels were empty :( The bread was soggy and it wasn't from the broth. The fries were ok. I noticed they put all the long fries on top and left us with crumbs on the bottom. Really? 

So my friend excused herself to the ladies room as I continued working to try and find a mussel with meat (the mussels were ok too, not fabulous). I'm not joking here...THREE PEOPLE asked if they could dump my empty mussel bowl...THREE PEOPLE! There were only like 4 more mussels to finish. I had to shoo them away. The guy sitting next to me even made a comment and I said this was something like a Seinfield episode (leave me to my mussels!). Lol! 

FINALLY, I finished and they were so happy to take my empty mussel shells away. Wow, had you given me the attention upon my arrival, Meat and Potatoes, I might not have wrote this review.

All in all, Meat and Potatoes is like a really hot guy: yes, you're hot and nice to look at, but very shallow, snobby and conceited. Yes, their food is good, but you better pair that with outstanding service, which we did not receive. With you being in business for all this time and with other restaurants giving stellar service, you should know better by now, Meat and Potatoes-hence the 2 stars.",1.0

"Had a very enjoyable dinner here during my girls weekend in Las Vegas. The service is very good. The servers pay attention and my water was never left empty (which doesn't happen most of the time). The lychee martini was very good, the alcohol was not overpowering with just the right amount of lychee juice. We ordered:

1.  the oyster shooters--- my first time trying this dish and it went down so smooth.

2. Yellowtail with jalapeno- fish was very fresh and the sauce was light and flavorful. This was very good!

3. Steamed Cod- This tasted just like sea bass. The fish was fresh and very meaty. Lots of flavor and very moist. It was garnished with pickled ginger- this was the best ginger I have ever had!

4. Steamed Seabass- After trying the cod, the seabass did not compare. It was served in a bowl with a soy based sauce- garnished with enoki mushrooms and bok choy. I didn't really care for the sauce. I felt that it took away from the flavor of the fish. 

Overall, the food was very good. Would be a place I would go back to again on future visits to Las Vegas. If I had to recommend one item on the menu from what we ordered, it would be the Steamed cod.",1.0

"Casanova is a cute little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. Unfortunately, I didn't know how small it was. I had a table reservation for 13 people and was seated outside the actual restaurant which was really the middle of the walkway of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It was extremely loud, especially since there is a bar not 10 feet away. It's also right before the food court so there was a ton of food traffic throughout dinner. I would definitely reccommend this place if you were in a small group, up to 4 at the most. They would most likely seat you inside where it is very adorably decorated.

For an Italian restaurant at The Venetian, the food was extremely affordable. I got the Timballo which is basically penne in a creamy pesto sauce baked with parmesan on top. It was so flavorful and very filling; I wasn't able to finish my plate. The bread they serve you is so good too and delightfully roasted and warm.

"I've been a professional athlete for 11 years and been playing a variety of sports my entire life.  Dr. Dettling is one of the best kept secrets in this field. I've visited a variety of Orthopedic Doctors over the years from the east coast to midwest and Las Vegas area and nobody really comes close to him. Not just for his extraordinary work but for how he treats his patients. I've never felt more comfortable with a Doctor like I do him. His staff is outstanding and goes out of their way to help you. Everyone in his office is great at what they do. I really like all of his staff members.

"I really struggled between a three and four star rating. I wish there were halves but the ""A-OK"" description on the three star seemed to fit with our experience at CHoP.

My boyfriend's parents were in town from Ohio and we wanted to take them to a nice restaurant nearby for Father's Day. We made reservations at CHoP for 7:30pm, showed up right at 7:30pm and then waited about ten minutes before we were seated. This bugs the crap out of me and reminds me of that episode of Seinfeld - ""You just don' t know how to HOLD the reservation!"" The wait wouldn't have been SO bad had there actually been a waiting area. You literally walk in the door and are faced with the hostess, who is basically working out of what can only be described as a sideways cabinet. Anywhere you stand, you were in the way of guests trying to leave, guests coming through the door and waitresses going to the other side of the room.

Once we were seated we were greeted by our waiter and got some apps ordered. The calamari was a smidge on the rubbery side but not overly greasy and the sauce was tasty. The parents got spinach dip, which was described as ""good, but there's too much spinach and not enough dip"". 

Sadly, they were out of scallops and something else that 1\/2 of our table wanted to order. Our dinner took about 25-30 minutes to come out because our ticket was apparently put in right after a ticket for 20 people. I can only comment on my entree and my boyfriend's steak because the other guests described their meals as just good. The seasoning on my chicken was tasty and it was well cooked. The macaroni and cheese was just eh. The cheeses they used didn't seem to add much of a cheesy flavor (weird, I know) and it was more gritty than creamy. The boyfriend's steak seemed to be charred on both sides but he said it was still tender. His baked potato was room temperature.

Both waiters kept repeating the other by asking for our drink orders in succession, each unaware of the other. Once they found out there was a slight verbal disagreement as to who would actually serve us. Made for a bit of an awkward experience for us.

And boy am I glad I did, I drank four glasses during dinner and got one to go. STREETCAR DONT EVER CHANGE YOUR SWEET TEA!!! 
We all ordered different po boys, my dad got the oyster shrimp and catfish po boy, my husband got the roast beef poboy after we confirmed that the gravy was indeed debris gravy like back home, and I ordered the po boy. All dressed. The po boys were all very good, though in hindsight I would have ordered something else besides the fried oyster one. For sides to share we also got the hush puppies, the fried okra, and the cheese fries with gravy. I was so pleased when the hush puppies came out hot with a pleasant spice level, and a lovely side of remoulade. Again the first good remoulade I've found in Las Vegas. Lola's needs to try to kidnap their remoulade recipe, because it blows theirs out of the water. The fried okra had a lovely spicy breading and the okra had perfect flavor and weren't mushy or gross. The cheese fries arrived with a cheese sauce with a side of gravy. Very good, but not sure I'll get again, since the other sides were so amazing. The Cajun cole slaw that came with our poboys was AMAZING. I'm a cole slaw snob and I LOVED mine, my two year old fell in love with the cole slaw as well. The fries are awesomely seasoned. 
As stuffed as we were we got an order of the beignets... Being a Louisiana girl I know this is crazy, but the beignets rivaled cafe du mondes. I know, I know, but true. Thick, yummy, hot, big, and the perfect coating of powdered sugar. The oil may have been a but on the old side, but after my second bite I didn't get that taste at all, I was just concerned on getting that beignet into my tummy. Yum! Wish we would've tried the other desserts too but we all already were ready to be rolled out the door we were so stuffed. I definitely recommend this place. Hopefully they will get a new location soon that's a little more comfortable to get to.

"I came down to Charlotte for a bar hop event. I am rating this on customer service only. Never stepped foot in the door. The first bouncer was a little rude and I didn't think anything of it. We went to another bar and decided to give this bar a try. On our tickets it said the event went from 11p-2a. The second bouncer said that they are not honoring that because he said the event went from 8-11. He was pretty rude about it. We showed him our tickets and he said ""well I'm sorry"". He was rude and never asked someone about it or even seemed to care if he lost our service. We continued on to other bars that said that they never heard that it ended at 11 and that it goes all night like our tickets said. I asked around about this bar and a lot of people didn't recommend it. Even though I never stepped foot in the door... The service at the front was horrible.... I will just say I will never step foot in there and they really need to improve their costumer service big time!!!!!",1.0

"Visually appealing and nice idea, this was described in a local review and a Mexican food Benihana. Menus were bulky and difficult to read in such a close seating arrangement (go there, you'll see what I mean). Food was bland, though my wife described the green sauce on the enchiladas as very good. Rice was undercooked (it's not supposed to crunch like that), and the server looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a spoon for the charro beans. Service was clumsy at best as staff seemed unfamiliar with the tablets and card readers used for ordering and billing. While my server got it on the first try, I saw another server at an adjacent table scan a patron's card at least a half a dozen times. When presented with the check, I saw that my entrée was $2 less than the price on the menu, but I was charged $18 for a $10 quesadilla. I pointed those errors out to my server who corrected one and let me keep the $2 discount. I imagine these are issues that will resolve themselves as staff become more familiar with their equipment. If this restaurant can improve service and bring the food up a few notches, then I believe it will survive. If not, it'll be another empty retail space.",1.0

This place is always very sparkling clean and organize.  I almost gave this places four star rating  The only reason  because of ""a couple"" of the cashiers.

And a pedicure was only $25!  I usually expect to spend more than that, so that was a good surprise.  Make sure you have some cash for a tip because you can't add it to your bill (not sure why not).

"My experience with Apple Xchange was just short of perfect.  

My iPhone 5 got stuck in the mechanism of a recliner, and the glass was crushed and damaged severely.  I reviewed several iPhone repair shops on Yelp and settled on The Apple Xchange - partly because of the great reviews and partly because of the Yelp coupon.  I spoke to Alan who said he could fix my phone on the same day.  Alan greeted me and quickly got started.  They had a comfortable waiting area with a movie running.  About 45 minutes later, one of the techs told me that my phone was ready.  I tested the glass and there were a few dead-spots.  Without hesitation, the tech apologized and retreated with my phone to the back room.  15 minutes later, he brought out my phone and it was good to go.

"NAIL SPA is amazing! I went in a few weeks ago and had deluxe pedicures with my gf and it was probably best one ever. Instead of lining pedicure chairs in rows in large room, each set of 2 chairs are in their own separate rooms.

I went today and just got a gel manicure from Kim. Love my bright neon color I picked (they have great selection of colors)!

I went in with a headache and left without one! He was so great, so knowledgable and knew exactly where my trigger points were and talked me through each one.

The two stars are for the nice staff and the good drink specials. They also have a nice outdoor area.

The food, though, is way below par. I love Thai food. I love Indian. I love fusion. But this is just confused. It seems like all the dishes are very sweet and many of the ""creative"" dishes are just a jumble of flavors. Tonight, I ordered the Krazy Pad Thai and it was soooo sweet and vinegary I couldn't eat more than 2 bites. I won't even tell you what it smelled like.

The waiter was awesome, though, and gladly brought out tacos instead. They were much better but still sweet, as were the beans.

"A local pittsburgher would love this place. It smells like a cafeteria, not a fine dining establishment . The crowd says it all.

First off the benches outside were faded and ruins the atmosphere. Store bought bread was served with oil, yuk. We asked for butter. It came in ice cold packets. Not classy.

The zucchini rolls were not appealing and they were poorly pan fried with greasy blobs of cheese inside . 

Crab cakes, flavorless, colorless and with mushy breading. Veggies on the side were pretty but tasteless. .

Soup was bland, ok but wasn't from scratch, it tasted like Sysco prepared all of the sauces here.

"The food here is excellent! Sometimes you want to indulge in good food, but then you regret eating all the fattening and unhealthy foods in the world. This place allows you to make healthy food decisions and you leave the restaurant not regretting a thing. They offer vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, and everything to ensure that everyone in your party can enjoy. Let's start with the drinks, my party tried the Cucumber Mint Lyfe Water, the Orange Ginger Chia Lyfe Water, the Mango Cucumber Lime Smoothie, and the Classic Lemonade. All the drinks were very unique in ingredients, refreshing, and delicious, you have to try them all!!! Next the appetizer, we had the Grilled Artichokes and these were hard to eat because I've never ate Artichokes before, but they were still very delicious. For soups, we tried the Squash Lemongrass and it was excellent, it is a very good choice for anyone who likes squash. Unfortunately, we did not try any salads, but I'm sure it will not be a disappointment the next time i go. For sandwiches and burgers, we tried the Grass-Fed Burger and the Pizzadillawich, personally, if you go here, try something besides the burger, not that it's not delicious, but that you'd miss out on all the unique dishes, and as for the PIzzadillawich, it was so worth it! Lastly, I chose the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach Penne. I chose to do the vegan option and got this dish with the Gardein Chick'n and it was not a disappointment at all, it tasted just like chicken!

"I love food but can't always afford to dine out at $$$ places so when Travelzoo had a deal for ENVY Steakhouse in Las Vegas I bought one: $79 for $140 worth of food. I made reservations on opentable.com and got 1000 points for it which I can cash in towards a dining certificate which meant I saved more money. ENVY is located in the Renaissance Hotel which is right next to the Las Vegas Convention Centre. 
The Renaissance a non-smoking, non-gaming hotel which is amazing considering you can find slot machines literally everywhere from Laundromats to your local grocery store. There is valet parking for free and you may enter the restaurant either via the hotel lobby or by the separate street entrance located around the corner to your right from the main entrance of the hotel.

To me Envy has the look and feel of a classic steakhouse with muted lighting and solid furniture. The seats are upholstered and well padded and seating consists of tables or booths. The menu reflects the same: Steak and Seafood and what I always find on menus of steakhouses: Caesar Salad, French Onion Soup and some entrees for those who want something other than steak. We started with Espresso Skirt Steak and the Peppered Calamari & Rock Shrimp. The Espresso Skirt Steak was nice. The beef was melt in your mouth tender. The hint of espresso was a little too subtle, it tasted more of the wine used in the deglazing; I could barely tell that espresso was there. The Calamari & Rock Shrimp were cooked well, tender but the sauces were a great disappointment. They tasted like they came out of a jar; one tasted like concentrated ketchup with some salt and pepper added and the other was obviously a sweet chili Thai sauce that was also out of a bottle. The portions were extremely generous. I made the mistake of not having steak at a steakhouse. I had the Grand Seafood Plateau and my companion had the Balsamic Lamb Rack.

The Seafood Plateau looked magnificent and everything was fresh and well prepared but really it was just fresh seafood boiled and chilled. There were oysters, crab legs, lobster, shrimp, clams, and mussels. The clam and mussels were a little over done. The shrimp was huge jumbo shrimp and the best part of the plateau. The sauces again were terrible, the spicy cocktail sauce was the same sauce that came with the Calamari and Rock Shrimp, a mayonnaise, and there was another apple cider vinegar type sauce that really didn't add anything to the seafood so I opted to just use pepper and lemon juice. Regular price is $55, so I was glad I was using a discounted voucher. The lamb was cooked to perfection but lacked flavour. The sides were underwhelming. We had Grilled Asparagus with Dijon Glaze and Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The portions again were huge and we could have done with just one side dish as both entrees had vegetables with them. The best was the garlic mashed potatoes. The asparagus and the glaze didn't go together and the Brussels sprouts were pretty basic.

For dessert we shared the Crème brûlée. Presentation was nice with some berries on the side. It was good but again not the best Crème brûlée I've had. It was ok. Our server was pleasant and helpful and even kept a running tab so that we knew how much we had left of the $140 at the end of our meal if we wanted to use it up. Overall it was a disappointing experience for the type of restaurant it was. The food was underwhelming and perhaps business has reflected that and the reason for the travelzoo voucher promotion. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the meal. It is not a place I would return to given the myriad of restaurants in Las Vegas.",1.0

"Avoid this Kidsquest Boulder Station location and go for other locations at Las Vegas if possible!

I was extremely dissatisfied about the child care service provided to my 19-month old baby from this center. First, during her 5-hour stay, not food nor drink was provided or attempted to be provided to my baby. My baby was crying like crazy when I picked her up. I need to give her formula immediately. She consumed it non-stop and stopped crying after that. I read the check-out form and no meal\/snack\/fluid was noted. Second, when I checked her in, the staff said a meal will be given to her since she will have a 5-hour stay from evening around dinner time. Obviously, it was just a lie. In addition, I was not reminded at all about the additional charge if I pick the kid up late. I was charged $25 even I was a few minutes late. Finally, the staff over there were totally unfriendly. I was treated like I have been giving them trouble. Their attribute was unacceptable and they were irresponsible for my kid's stay. I called the customer relations department and told them all these. They said they are going to research and talk to the director of this center. I will wait for their callback and may need to escalate this to Nevada Department of Health and Human Services of their inhuman treatment to my baby.",1.0

Cotton candy foie gras- unbelievable!  Sweetness of the light puffed sugar, mildly cuts into the deep rich flavor of the foie gras, making this so wonderful.

"Would highly recommend ballooning with Aerogelic!

Arrived at the pickup station (in Phoenix) on time and Shane, Andy, and Sean were ready and waiting. After quickly signing some waivers, we were on our way to the ballooning location. When we asked if it would be ok for a quick restroom stop, they had no issues, even stopping at a 2nd location when the 1st wasnt available. 

They prepped us with what to expect, where to stand when the balloon was being inflated and said if we wanted to help they would let us. The setup was the most interesting part...the work these guys do to get an 8 story balloon ready to go is impressive. After helping (such a fun experience) we all fit into the balloon and were up up and away. We soared to 3,000 ft getting amazing views of the area. We even got a chance to fly closer to the ground briefly back up letting the winds take us. We were able to see all sorts of vegetation, mountains, and suburb locations all making for interesting conversations. We were a group of 6 in a balloon (+ 2 for the pilots) and had more than enough room. During the flight, they were quite knowledgeable about flying, the area, and the history of ballooning (such a great ending to the trip). 

Side story: while flying relatively low, I dropped my sunglasses by accident and thought it was a loss (would have been 100% my fault)...but Sean was driving behind us and managed to get them back to me without a scratch!

"This place used to be amazing but it's really gone downhill. I've been a customer for over 2 years and at first I was very happy. Unfortunately, my last 4 visits have been so bad I will never be back. Here are some examples:

1.  For some reason my lash artist decided to remove the lashes and I had in place. Instead of the medium and long thick lashes that I usually get she decided to replace them with short thin lashes. When I left there were twice as many lashes on my left eye compared to my right and overall I had fewer lashes in place than when I arrived. I contacted local manager the store before I left they just kind of shrugged and said sorry you weren't happy with your service.  I finally got ahold of another manager who first told me there was nothing they could do. After some argument they had me drive all they way to henderson where it took almost 3 hours to fix the damage. 

2. This time I was called and told I needed to come in half an hour early because they made an error scheduling. When I said I couldn't because I was at work they told me they were going to cancel my appointment. I found someone to work for me showed up at the time they told me and when I arrived they claimed that they never called me. I had to wait over an hour before I was actually seen.

3. On this visit the Lash artist asked me if I wanted any changes. I said I wanted to same medium and long thick lashes that I always get. Halfway through my fill I heard her ask for thin medium lashes. When I reminded her that I was supposed to be getting thick lashes she told me they changed the terminology and the ones that were previously called think were now called thin.  At the end of my appointment for my lashes didn't look the same at all and when I commented she told me I was wrong and that is how they always look

4 Tonight, I again heard the lash artist ask for thin lashes. When I questioned her about the change in terminology she told me there was no change. She then proceeded to tell me that I wasn't allowed to get the glasses because my lashes were too fine. After much discussion that I have been getting thick lashes for the last two years they finally decided that I was ""allowed ""to get thick lashes. They told me half my fill would be thin and half my fill would be thick. They spent less than five minutes giving me thick lashes. My lashes today look exactly the same as last time and I am again leaving unhappy.

"Mmmmmmm Bagel Cafe! On our weekend of adventures Jessie B and I stopped here. She'd never been and I've long loved Bagel Cafe. (They used to have a location in Henderson.) It was a Saturday and pretty busy, but we only had to wait like 5 minutes. 

Jessie and I looked over the menu. I knew that whatever I ordered I wanted a garlic bagel to be involved. Bagel Cafe's menu is huge and everything is tasty. After much back and forth I decided on the shrimp salad sandwich on a garlic bagel and a side of potato salad. Jessie choose the tuna salad on an everything bagel with a side of pasta salad. I also ordered an ice coffee! It was huge, but seriously watered down. I was so happy when our food came cause I was so hungry. My sandwich was piled high with huge shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and red onion. Yummy! It was heaven in my mouth. The shrimp melded so well with that soft garlic bagel. Tasty! It came with my favorite kind of pickle, the half done dill pickle! (Swoon) I didn't really care for their potato salad which I remember being good. I think I've been spoiled by Weiss's potato salad. Jessie also gobbled up her tuna sandwich. I was so glad she liked it. 

The service was good considering how busy it was. I love that their dining room is large and you can even just hit up the deli and take whatever you want home. 

I always love Bagel Cafe. The food is beyond wonderful. You may think the prices are a little high, but for the quality and portion size it's so, so worth it. If you've never been go now, right now!!",1.0
"Tried this place the other night with a fellow Yelper! It's good to know that we have Chef Marmulstein in the area since he will be featured at the James Beard House.

Great atmosphere and ambiance at Salty Sow. Tried the crispy Brussels sprout leaves as a starter and that was great. Really enjoyed the crispy twist with the Brussels. Was a little upset since my first choice for dinner, rotisserie-roasted pork had just ran out. So my second option was the Asiago-Crusted Halibut, it was superb. My friend had the slow-cooked beef shoulder which came in a black iron pot.

All in all I enjoyed this place. Ordered the chocolate mouse truffle for dessert and YUM!",1.0
"What a great find! The service is for sure the best I have had in Edinburgh. The owner\/chef was very hospitable and chatty. Lovely Italian man who we ended up having some really interesting conversations with. The food was also very good! We had a special; chicken wrapped in Parma  ham smothered in a white wine sauce. They even made a special small pizza for the wee one! 

The people working here really fussed over our daughter which was a breath of fresh air. Most places don't really interact with children in this way. It really sets a positive good dinner atmosphere for a family. The owner even surprised wee one with a free ice cream dessert! Which was the icing on the cake!

The gulab vodkas were amazing and I had three! I'm Indian so I'm assuming they're supposed to take after gulab jamun which is an Indian dessert. They are really amazing...so please try!

Service was fantastic. The waiters went above and beyond for my sister and I.

"Oh boy. Given all the hype over David's Bridal in the US, you'd think it'd be a phenomenal one-stop shop with exceptional offerings. Not quite...

It took a while for anyone to greet us when our group of 4 came in for a scheduled bridesmaid appointment on a Tuesday evening. We signed in and were told we could freely look at the dresses on the floor and someone would be by to help us out. Went through, picked out a bunch, and..no one came. Literally had to hunt someone down before we got some help and settled into the dressing rooms. 

The sales associate who we eventually did find was quite friendly and helpful, though busy, having to simultaneously tend to other clients. She was quick to grab additional sizes and dress options in the requested colour scheme. Unfortunately sizes on the floor are limited for each colour, especially on the smaller end.

Then came the fine print as we were close to finalizing a Vera Wang option in the ~$200 range:

- The appointment was booked through the bridal show and therefore offered some sort of discount. Discount only applied for the bride on one item - but, the associate assured that if we were to finalize the purchase that evening, the higher ups would be able to arrange something
- We had 3 bridesmaids present and a 4th would need to schedule a time to try on the same dress. The sales associate couldn't guarantee any discounts if the sale wasn't finalized that night.
- The seamstress was called over to quote a fee for hemming only (not including any alterations to the top): $76.
- The order would take 16 weeks to come in. SIXTEEN!!!

Needless to say, we left quite underwhelmed. Lots of room for improvement here, David.",1.0

When I arrived the salon was neat, organized, and smelled great. Janet came out within a minute of me checking in and took me to the back. She was super sweet and friendly. During the shampoo she offered a complimentary hand massage or mini facial but I declined. She gave me a short haircut with long layers, blow dryed it  and even styled it for me!

"Absolutely terrible customer service. Complained about bugs and lack of service in July. Tech was on vacation, so couldn't get someone out until August.

"This is my favourite pizza place in Toronto. I always get the slices so I can't comment about the other dishes. My favourite is the Arrabiatta (sp?) which is a loaded veggie slice and is DELICIOUS. Their slices are always super fresh and they are absolutely gigantic. One slice is a large meal. There is no way I could eat 2 slices! I also think the price is excellent, the slices come in under $5. It's not easy to find a huge, hot, fresh meal with quality ingredients under $5 these days! 

I'm kinda surprised by the bad reviews here, this place is amazing. Staff is always super friendly, quick, and accommodating. Once I showed up after they had locked up and the dude counting the till saw me looking sad outside, and he re-opened the store just for me! 

I like their crust too, not too heavy, not too thin. I love how they offer to brush garlic oil onto the pizza crust, it's like free garlic bread. 

It's also open late, and it has a patio. And a liquor license! I love King Slice.",1.0

Cool dim lighting and a heavy rock \/ metal playlist was playing and it was refreshing instead of the top 40 at alot of places. We had the house beer (i forget the name but i think they brew it themslves) it was pretty decent and good price. around 10 more people started filtering in. the crowd is a bit more of a punk \/ metal crowd which is cool except for all the cigarette-bumming going on as soon as you step outside. Bouncer was cool, bartender with the tattoos was super hot and friendly. for fans of sneaky dees, wide open and hard luck, i'd recommend this place.",1.0

No one behind the counter understood ""no carbs"" because it is not a healthy cooking place. It's gyros. I ordered the lamb and it was fatty, flavorless and just not that good.

"Spring Valley Hospital is one of the five facilities operated by Valley Health Service, three of which I have worked in, as an ER nurse, during the night shift. Not that I don't love my job (I've been doing it for 20+years) but I can tell you that, having worked in 5 different states in my 20+ year career, Las Vegas has by far the worst medical care community. 

If and when you ever have to go to the ER. please keep in mind that, for the most part, the nurses hands are tied. Honestly, we really do advocate for the patients.

We don't want you to wait for hours in the waiting room, we don't want you to be evaluated in the waiting room where everyone can hear about the last time you pooped.

"Our 6 year old  daughter was a member of Karate Charlotte for about one year. We found the staff to be friendly and personable. She enjoyed going to karate and liked the instuctors. The problem was that in the time she was a member  , she learned very little karate. Many classes would entail standing on a line of 7 children waiting for a chance for one kick or punch with the feedback "" good job "" from a 12 year old . In her sparring sessions with other students she never got any feedback . Ever.  Time was wasted on activities that had nothing to do with karate and after paying an additional fee everyone would get promoted to the next level. During this 7-10 day period of promotions karate was put on hold.. Although Karate Charlotte is a business and you expect their focus to be on making money, the overt focus on long term financial commitments , from their customers , whether agreed to or not , made Karate Charlotte a difficult place to do business with. Do not agree to have automated credit card payments. Nice people , not very good at developing children in the martial arts , and questionable business ethics is how I would sum it up. Our daughter has been a member of another organization for the last three months and we are thrilled with her development. Learned far more in 3 months then at one year at Karate Charlotte.",1.0
"I've been so excited to see a Portuguese restaurant coming into the neighborhood since the first ""coming soon!!"" In the windows.   For weeks every time I walked by I whispered ""please have shrimp rissois on the menu, please have shrimp rissois on the menu, please have shrimp rissois on the menu"".

Our group of friends decided we would all go together and last night was finally the night! 

THE SHRIMP RISSOIS ARE LOVELY!!! Prayers: answered.  The beauty of these little handmade fried dumplings is the crispy breaded outside with the creamy shrimpy goodness inside.  They're high on my list of comfort foods. 

 I had the Bacalhau com natas... what a lovely plate of cod with a cheesy creamy topping,  generous portion too with black olive garnish mmm... The food was all piping hot when it got to the table.  The chorizos were flambéd right at the table!! (And all who tried it said it was delicious and not greasy) two of our friends had a steak and cheese sandwhich with a spicy gravy and a fried egg on top - that looked amazing... two had the pork and beef skewers and commented that the spice rub was just right, flavorful with heat, but not overpowering.  My sister in law had steak with potatoes and an egg, she was impressed at how perfectly the steak was done to her order (medium rare)... 

We didn't even wait for our mains to make our verdict - after the appetisers (the afore mentioned rissois, along with cod cakes and 2 chorizos) we had decided we were definitely coming back.  

The wait staff were helpful and attentive, I had trouble deciding between the two bacalhau dishes and with a single question ""do you like salty food"" our waitress helped me decide.  I've never had bacalhau com natas before and wasn't sure what to expect, while I want to try more dishes, I know that's a solid go-to for me next time I'm there. 

We were all surprised, with the size of our meals - 6 mains, 6 or 7 starters - at the size of our check - only £99!! It's BYOB but still, that was a nice surprise.  

We live in the neighborhood and Tugas is always fairly packed so I'd advise making a reservation.

"Unfortunately everything that my husband and I ordered was unsatisfactory. The burnt ends were extremely dry, and the crab cakes and chili were terribly bland. On a brighter note, the sweet tea was delicious.",1.0
"So, let's start with first impressions.  The decor is trying to be upscale but really looks quite cheap, because the materials are cheap.  All black and white and sparkly with absolutely no warm touches.  This feeling of coolness carried through to the service which felt slightly condescending.  We ordered the cajun calamari to start because I really wanted to try it, unfortunately it was slightly rubbery so overcooked yet somehow managed to have mushy wet breading as well.  The dipping sauces were sour cream and frank's red hot sauce and the calamari was sprinkled with generic cajun spice mix.  Not sure what I was expecting but I was unable to eat more than three pieces so we sent it back with all those complaints and all they did for us was take 15% off that item, so all in all I paid about $11 or so for an item we didn't even eat.  All the server had to say was ""that's weird, this is my favourite dish here, usually it's quite good.""  yeah, thanks for nothing.
That said, I gave this place 2 stars because the pizza was quite good, however, the beer selection leaves quite a lot to be desired which I find shocking for a pizza place.  All in all, if you want decent pizza and don't want to travel too far if you're in town for a game, you might be happy enough with this place if you just stick to pizza and don't mind drinking swill.  Oh, sorry I forgot they do have Guinness on the menu but were out of it that night, also not on tap.
The place doesn't even have a comment card or guest survey, so that combined with the service and the pathetic discount tells me they just don't care about their guest's experience at all and are ok with getting walk-ins only.  Worst business plan ever, manager should be fired.
I was also pretty shocked when I got the bill, approx $100 for two people to eat pizza and drink a couple beers.  I will never be back.",1.0
Unique experience. Super fancy fun place in the bottom floor of the Omni. The bartenders are top notch.

"TERRRRRIBLE Customer Service! The owners are rude and do not care AT ALL about their customers. I prepaid to have the bottom of one of my stiletto heels replaced and the owner said that he did not have the exact size and would have to shave off the standard size to match the other heel. When we returned, the heel of the one shoe did not match the other, and he told us he can't do anything about it. When we asked him why he didn't shave the bottom to match the other heel, he said he told us before that he couldn't do it and that we should have just replaced the bottom of both the heels. If he didn't tell us that there was a possibility to get it shaved to match, WHERE WOULD WE HAVE GOT THAT IDEA FROM? He realized after the fact that he couldn't shave it, because the pin would break, but did not mention that at all to us. He told us he could do it and then turned around and said, ""'I never said that!"" He lied, refused to give us our money back, and kept saying, ""Ok, go now...I don't care! Do whatever you want..."" I'm not sure how they are running a business when they don't care or value their customers.

"With all the fancy buffets and all you can eat sushi and world famous chefs in vegas, believe it or not, this place was my favorite meal of this trip.  I'm not sure if i was just over the busy flashy lights and glitz and glamor of the strip but it was just nice to have a simple, delicious, down to earth meal that didn't try to seduce you with a famous Chef name or fancy plating.

I ordered the étouffée ($21.99) and also had a taste of the house gumbo ($23.99) and the combo pan roast ($23.99) all came with shrimp, crab and lobster.  The shrimps where whole pieces they were nice size, the crab was jumbo lump and was shredded and mixed throughout, it added a lot of body to each dish, the lobster was just tiny pieces and personally i think i could do without it.

My favorite was the gumbo or the étouffée, they had a bolder flavor than the pan roast which was more creamy.  I could see why they said that their pan roast is the most popular dish, i just prefer a more savory flavor over creamy.  The pan roast was so creamy, it almost reminded me of a rich bisque.

Each dish is made to order in its own individual kettle, you can also choose your own level of heat, i ordered my Étouffée a level 5, the gumbo a 4 and the pan roast a 6.  I liked the spice level on the étouffée and the pan roast but wished the gumbo was hotter, but it wasn't my dish so no complaints.  I usually don't care for Cajun food, its very rare that i find a place that i like, i think its because its made fresh and the shrimp is cooked fresh, where as normally everything is stewed for a long time and the shrimp is overdone and rubbery.  But this one blew me away so much that i also ordered a gumbo to go and had it for breakfast then next day.

It's a small bar in the middle of Palace Station, which is more of a locals casino.  With only 17 seats even a seemingly short line was over an hour half, but well worth it.  Its open 24 hours so maybe you'd have a better shot during odd hours.

Overall the system was a good flow. Friendly customer service reps. I paid $40 for a wash and detail. My kids had made a mess with their shoes and they managed to get rid of most of it. Other than that area the car looked like brand new which is more than I was hoping for. It took about 45 mins from start to finish which I was happy about because when something is done right it will not be done any sooner. There is plenty of seating area while you wait.

"I have been a regular customer at Barro's for almost 25 years and I am sorry to say the new Scottsdale location on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. gets a one star from us.

The crust on the pizza was soggy at best and the celery  that came with the wings looked like a truck had run it over which was also how it was on our first visit. How can you screw up celery?
We will revert back to the Pavillions  location where there never seems to be a problem. I doubt the F.L.R. location will be around long as again like our first visit we were the only two in the place at 6:30 PM. I guess that should have been a warning to us.",1.0

Food:
The food at Auntchiladas is close to authentic, but that isn't necessarily their goal. They serve a variety of dishes, like the chipotle chicken and the fish tacos, that are somewhat Americanized but are still very good. The el pollo fundido and chipotle chicken are my favorite dishes. The beans aren't loaded with lard so they are not very fattening and the rice is excellent. I order queso or abondigas soup for an appetizer. The free chips and salsa are great!

Service: 
This is where Auntchiladas loses many of their customers. To be fair, we have had some fantastic servers, but the majority of servers have been rather unfriendly. The food comes quickly, but don't expect to have time to fully enjoy it. If the restaurant is packed, the waiter will rush your meal by continuously trying to take your plate. The female servers are often dressed to attract attention. We have been at the restaurant on afternoons where all of the women were dressed in bikini tops!

Maybe she should have WRITTEN THINGS DOWN at this point if she couldn't remember.

We get our burgers. They look sooo good, I want to devour it. I take a bite, it's like the best burger I ever had, until my next bite included a half melted bite of AMERICAN cheese. Gross. But you know, no one WROTE MY ORDER down. He cut into his burger which looked so tasty I wouldn't let him eat it until I posted a photo of it to Facebook. And it's covered in BBQ sauce. No, he didn't order the BBQ burger he ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Hmmm. She even asked him didn't he order a BBQ burger? Well, if you had WRITTEN THE ORDER down on a piece of paper you could have seen that no, he did not, he ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  

Both burgers had to be redone.  And again, she has to ask us what our burgers were. WRITE IT THE EFF DOWN IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER!! We get our burgers, simple cheeseburgers after an eternity, his is great.  Mine however, must have been grilled where the hottest peppers in all the world were because my lips were on fire to the point where I was crying. My dude asked if they season the meat and she said no, so obviously someone didn't clean the grill. Gee, thanks, for the most unpleasant burger experience ever. Our server did offer to make me something else. And wait a third time for food? No thanks.  I will have better luck at home at this point. 

Our burgers were generously taken off the bill, but we were still charged for fries and soup which COME with the burgers. Personally, I think after messing up both burgers once and having a replacement sent back for ungodly spicy-ness that a visit from a manager would have been appreciated or the entire bill save for our alcoholic drinks comped. 

Our bill came to $35.00 after our $10.00 cheeseburgers were taken off which would have made our bill $55.00 ish.  We tipped $10.00 for terrible service (we had to remind her about waters we ordered, drinks took forever to be delivered to our table-we could see them sitting on the bar, we had to ask for appetizer plates, the menus which LITERALLY are nearly half the size of the table were never picked up, and the ordering debacle..she did not deserve that tip at all!  It wasn't even busy, she had two tables, one guy and the two of us!) Of course maybe the cooks couldn't read her...oh, wait, she didn't WRITE ANYTHING DOWN, so there was nothing to read.... So who really knows why I got american instead of cheddar cheese. And I doubt she poured pepper spray on my second burger, but the tip I really wanted to leave is...

ERIN. WRITE. DOWN. YOUR. ORDERS. 
 
I wanted to write it on the check so the manager could see it, but I left a cash tip and didn't want to end up on Facebook looking like a cheapskate who doesn't know how to tip on a bill even with things taken off and a snarky comment which I saved for Yelp so everyone can see it.

My advice is IF you visit this place ask your server to write your order down so there is no confusion. Don't go expecting good, prompt service. The food is delicious...the stuff that comes out CORRECT from the kitchen anyway.  If you don't go out often and you want to treat yourself to a nice evening out to just relax and enjoy good food, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO THAT!

I can promise I will NOT be back.

"This park has become my favorite spot to relax as of late...
We Hendersonians are rather spoiled when it comes to walking trails. Not only are there plenty to choose from in the city, but most are well taken care of and offer nice ambiance along the way. 
This park has it all. The lake was the driving point for me. Perhaps being born and raised in the desert and being deprived of any hint of naturally occurring water has made me accustomed to such appreciation. You can feed the ducks or enjoy their company from a distance while you walk or ride your bike along the perimeter.
There are also basketball and volleyball courts, a sizable field and segregated tables that offer more privacy than the usual setting of many crowded together under a tent. 
Of course your pets are welcome as well.",1.0
You don't get your windows replaced every day but when you do I recommend calling Mark Garcia. I have never met a more honest and fair craftsman that does such quality work.

"I really enjoyed my drop-in class at Charlotte Yoga with Joey. This studio has one room for all yoga classes, so I was impressed at the turn-around time between the hot class and the power hour, switching out pretty quickly in 15 minutes. The hot yoga instructor was kind enough to do a quick Swiffer job on the hardwoods to mop up any leftover sweat pools, for which I was grateful. Glad to see they do this here, as I know not all studios do between classes! 

Most importantly though, the class was great. Joey had a great way of bringing intention to the practice upon opening, but still allowing each person to have their own experience. The music was at a comfortably loud and upbeat level, a tricky sweet spot to find. Loud enough not to be distracted by others' breathing or talking outside of the studio, not so loud as to not be able to get lost inside one's practice. The sequencing was exactly what I would have expected from the class description. 

Oh, and he was thoughtful enough to ask my name and introduce himself, always a nice touch to a new student!

Was rude and will never go back again! 24 years a loyal customer! Plenty of great places for pizza now! Better watch out for your customer service!",1.0
I'll start by saying the place has a nice wow factor to it. The ambiance is nice. One of wife's friends took us out for dinner this past weekend with our kids. We let them order as we're not familiar with Persian food. The kabobs of meat were great! Very tasty and moist. I have taken notice of a drink they have it's a carbonated yogurt drink. The more I drank the more I started to take in to its unique flavours. Wifey was not fond of the drink the pre meal edibles was also not everyone in our family. I didn't mind it as I just love food. I would have not known about this place if it wasn't for our friends. I highly recommend a visit.,1.0
"Faustos is a place just like robertos or don tortaco the only thing they do different is the beans and the types of chips they use.

"Very disappointed today. Even though they included a free nachos which was nice, everything else was unpleasant. The staff were very unattentive and noisy. They left most of the work to one older woman. They did not explain the toppings well. No napkins are readily available. After waiting for five minutes with no one around, they finally gave me my burrito. When i asked for napkins for my wife and I, they gave me exactly two. Burritos were poorly made and very soggy. The ingredients did actually taste good though. It's too bad, i usually like this place but probably won't be coming back. If they paid more attention to detail and staff training, perhaps they could turn it around.",1.0
"Outstanding service from the time I walked in the door until the time I picked up my car. Obviously no one wants to spend time in a body repair shop, no more than a person wants to go to the doctor because you want to go there to hang out. You go to the auto body shop because you generally have had a misfortune by your own doing or someone else's. You're already not in a good mood, or at least your best mood; there's a price you're going to pay. Automall Autobody did a wonderful job in managing the mood, offering me water on a hot day, quickly getting to the bottom line, and coming up with a fair estimate. The job was done right, and quicker than the estimated time suggested. This was as good as it gets in having an experience at an auto body shop.",1.0
"One cuisine I wish was more common in Denver is Caribbean food. So I was particularly excited to try it when I was recently in Madison visiting friends. Jolly Bob's was quite excellent. I had some tostones for an appetizer, which was a great surprise as I haven't had tostones since I had a Puerto Rican housemate in college. These weren't as good as those and the guacamole could've used a bit more spice I thought, but they were still a nice trip to fond food memories.

I had some delicious tropical drink thing that was pretty good, though it took quite awhile for it to be served. Service here generally was a bit slow.

For an entree, I had the jerk chicken. It was a decent version though I also felt the spices could be upped a notch. It came with a salad that I actually thought was better since it had this wonderful curry mango dressing that should be put on practically anything. It also came with some peas and rice. I asked for some dressing for those and it went very well together.

With their expansive patio painted in pastels, I had a brief thought that I was actually in the islands somewhere instead of Madison, Wisconsin. That means they did their job.",1.0

"Recently ate at the newer Elliott and Kyrene location (which was my first experience with America's Taco Shop). I am glad that I visited the other location first because had I visited this location first I am not sure I would have tried it again.  

I ordered chicken tacos at both locations and the food quality was the same, both were very good.  The down side to this location is its age. Not that it has to be completely new or updated necessarily,  but it feels very dirty.  Bugs in the light shades,  dirty window sills,  and the bathrooms smell horrible.  Unfortunately their seating is limited,  so we also had to sit next to the bathrooms... which was not a pleasant experience.  

Lastly,  I ordered guacamole at both locations.  It seemed much less flavorful here and had a consistency of yogurt (not your typical guacamole).

I'm writing this in hopes that others will be aware of the deceit that he had experienced while visiting this last time around and hopefully not be stuck in the same predicament. First, the marquee had advertised $38\/night, but of course there is fine print and that wasn't the case once parked and inside. So, he negotiated a verbal deal with the receptionist Deborah getting it down to $60\/night. At the end of the stay he was billed $100 more than what was promised. Assuming there a mistake he tried to remove the extra charge but nobody was there willing to help. There was no manager to talk to and he had to leave for his flight. He was left with a helpless feeling an a huge overpriced bill. Since then, messages have been left with the hotel to try to recover the money and nobody has returned his messages.

There are about 5 different sandwich options as well as a few empanada choices. All the sandwiches are served on bread similar to that of a torta and when it comes right down to it, they basically are tortas-served on a loaf rather than a round. Meat, cheese, lettuce, peppers, mayo...if it tastes like a torta, looks like a torta, it is one. And I think this is where the restaurant will stumble. Sandwiches here go around $9.00 (accompanied by a smattering of fries). For a slightly lower price, you can go to the numerous Mexican restaurants that serve a far superior sammy.  The chimichurri sauce is solid but they need to mix it up (different flavor profiles, etc) if they want to make it for the long haul.",1.0

"SO much better than the Mandarin! The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. Their chicken balls are actual chicken with a thin layer of batter (as opposed to other places where it's all batter and barely any chicken).

The sushi rolls are fresh and always cold, so you don't have to worry about anything.

The desserts were great. The chocolate cake tasted like actual chocolate. It wasn't too sweet but it wasn't bland like other buffet places. Wasn't really a fan of the cream puffs though... The cream just tasted off... Maybe it was premade, like from a can. When I had a crepe, I added just a touch of the whipped cream and strawberry sauce and it worked out really well.

I didn't really have a problem with the decor. To be honest, if I'm going to a buffet place, decor doesn't really play a huge part in the overall experience, as long as its not dirty. 
The staff was really helpful to all of the customers, although there were a couple times where I felt like they didn't really want to be there which I feel is not very professional.

Either way, everyone must go to this place. The food and desserts are yummy and you don't feel horrible about yourself after overeatting because nothing is overly heavy.",1.0

"Sunday-Wednesday for $26.95 you get AYCE along w\/ AYCD Hot Sake & Bud Light.

Do I REALLY need to say more???  Ok - you twisted my arm.

The meal was fabulous - the appetizers (I love green oysters), the rolls, the sake - everything was worth every penny.

My new ""go to"" rolls - Ay chi chi (this roll has habanero sauce on it!) and any of the rolls w\/ sliced lemon on them.  They do an incredibly thin slice of lemon - the slight hint of citrus really add something special that I haven't experienced at other sushi restaurants.

This is a bit out of the way for us, but again, we enjoyed the food so much we will definitely be back again...I'm not sure you can beat the value anywhere else in Vegas.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service could have been a little more attentive.  All of the servers seem to share all of the tables - which I guess in theory is great, but in practice I think they lose track of what tables they've attended to and which ones they haven't.  We did have to flag them down a few times to fill waters, sakes, and order more rolls.",1.0

Everything was taken care of, they were honest and up front about all costs... which is also RARE, and AMAZING. Their price was very fair, especially for 3 guys!  

I did read another review that says they charge a bit extra for credit card use and this is TRUE. However, as a small business owner I can appreciate the want to not be charged an arm and a leg for credit card processing. They take cash and checks no problemo (and cards - but like I said, a reasonable fee goes along with it). 

All of my things were wrapped up nicely, they were very efficient with their time\/guys\/materials, and they got to and from locations quickly and safely. On top of it all they were very personable as well. Many thanks to previous Yelpers that greatly influenced my decision to use these guys.

"I am a big fan of both the Summer Pops and Movie in the Park events here. I'm not so much of a fan of the other events (ex. Great Grapes, Bourbon, Beer & BBQ etc). In short, the park is great for picnic style festivities. It's nice to sprawl out on the blanket, enjoy the music or movie. BUT it's a nightmare for any food\/drink stand up events. The space is very crowded. And it simply doesn't worth the $20-30 admission those events typically charge, only to be frustrated by the lines and the crowd.

Summer Pops Tips:
1. Summer Pops now are $10pp, $15 for the July 4th (7\/3\/2014 this year) event. You can buy online up until Friday afternoon, or you have 3 stations to buy from on day of. ""Gate"" opens at 5pm, and there are going to be some crazy people who think they need to rush and cut in front of you and run to stake their spots. Try not to be the crazy person.
2. Bring something heavy to put on the corners in case it's a windy day, but otherwise the blanket won't fly away. I managed to find some leftover bricks lying aside and a large fallen tree branch.
3. Low chairs please. Don't be THAT person with the full size tailgate chair, because you're blocking everyone else behind you.
4. Consider being there at 5pm to get the spot, then LEAVE. It's HOT, HOT, HOT out there. Enjoy a nice dinner nearby (you can even walk so you don't leave the prime parking spot you got). That way you can support the nearby eateries (I used to wait tables in Southpark years ago, and Sundays in June were horrible for business), stay out of the heat, and still be back in time for prelude.",1.0

We bought a new home in Desert Ridge and the previous owners had put a lot of time and money into the landscaping, including cactus, palms, flowering plants and banana trees. After 2 weeks of living in our new home, I noticed the plants looking pretty sad. I had no idea if the irrigation was working or not, since this was new to me. 

I called 3 irrigation companies, all 3 were answering machines, I left messages and to this day(2 weeks later) have not received a follow up call from any of them. I had waited 24 hours for a call and found Pro Irrigation Services. I called, Josh answered, he had someone here THAT DAY, he even showed up AFTER 5pm when most people are going home, fixed the issue and explained everything to me. He charged a very fair rate for parts and labor and everything works perfect! I will have them out this fall when things get slower for them, to update my system and make sure that it's all working properly!  

Don't waste your time calling all the other ones and don't waste your money trying to find someone who is the lowest price, it will cost you more to have it done over RIGHT!

In my opinion, this show is for people who are a little square and want to see something risque while they're in Vegas, but really an average episode of True Blood  is more risque than anything you'll see here.

I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving, we saw the manager Casey and the esthetician explained to her what happened.

We went on a Wednesday night, recently (unfortunately, the previous wednesday night DJ is no longer at this club). It was cold, but there was no coat check. I have honestly never heard such awful music in my life on that night with that particular DJ. It was so bad, that my friend suggested we leave a complaint. The DJ mixed SUM 41 (WHAT!!!) with a house track, and then decided to play Queen, and then go back to dance. Like what are you doing... No one was dancing. Long story short, I asked 3 different people to speak to management because there were 3 managers, but no one would let me. The hostess said: ""Like, I'm sorry you feel that way"" (like a broken record). And then said, ""Well, I like it."" Wonderful service.

We all had the 4 course tasting menu, which for $90, and all things considering, I thought was a very nice price.  Especially since the third course, the filet, I would guess at 10 to 12 oz.

"I absolutely wish they had a Mad Mex in New Jersey.  This place is pretty much all I look for in a Mexican restaurant.  Apparently, there are about 7 Mad Mex's all in the Pittsburgh area.  The weird thing about this one is that it is located at the bottom of an office building.  Our group started at the bar.  The bar area was actually pretty packed on a Tuesday night - mostly during Happy Hour time.  There was only bartender working and she was completely overwhelmed.  It took a while to get a drink.  They definitely should have had at least one other bartender working.  They had a decent draft selection and everyone said the margaritas were pretty good.  I did not try one.

2. Red Salsa - I liked the red salsa but I felt like it could have used a touch more spice.  Not bad, though.

3. Queso Dip - we also had some sort of queso dip that was good.  It was my 2nd favorite - nice and spicy and who doesn't like cheese?

4. Black Bean Dip - typically, I'm not the biggest bean dip fan but this was excellent.  It had some melted cheese and it had just the right amount of spice to it.  I was surprised I liked it so much and I would definitely order it again.

I housed a ton of chips and dip - probably too much but I enjoyed it.  For my meal, I went with the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito and I went with chicken as the filler.  Also, the burritos are ridiculously cheap at less than $10...and they're huge.  It's served American style - this is kind of like my own term - meaning it doesn't come with melted cheese and a side of rice and beans.  It's served in a huge tortilla wrapped up with only a little bit of some sort of chipotle sauce on top.  It also came with a ton of guac, sour cream and salsa on the side.  It's amazing how many places are stingy with those but not Mad Mex.  They totally hook you up.

The burrito was pretty freakin' good.  Nice and spicy and came stuffed with a ton of fillers.  It was also huge - I have to stress that.  Not many people will be able to finish a burrito in one sitting.  It's a huge meal, but the quality of the food was also very good.  

This is a really cool place.  I enjoyed everything about my meal.  Service was pretty good and the prices are more than reasonable - dare I say cheap.  I'll easily come out of my way to stop back here again the next time I am in Pittsburgh.  I'm hoping Mad Mex opens up some spots in Jersey by me.",1.0

It was also a nice surprise to find out that all dinners came with a salad and breadsticks!

She said it would be 15 minutes; and it was 15 minutes. I showed up and my food was getting bagged up and it was ready to go.

There is an area reminicient of a frat house with a beat up couch and a couple of glass tables.  The food was OK.  The stone table was stained from previous sauce spills and somewhat unappealing.  At a minimum they should have used place mats.

I love it here and will be  coming back often. I don't care about what they wear or what shoes they have on as long as the food is good and their service is friendly.

The pizza was good, but not the best.

I would nominate it for the freshest pizza, but again not the best.",1.0
"The night club was awesome. We had 10 people go there with us for my daughters 21st Birthday and we were all from California. Here's what I'm really disappointed about. We all arrived there Friday 10\/17\/2014 @ 10:15pm . We had checked their website and it said on Fridays it was $30 for men and $20 for woman, when we got there they said It was $35 for men and $25 for woman. That's not even the worse part of it, I really didn't care and wasn't going to argue about it. The bad part is, the line was so short and in fact, there was only 8 people ahead of us and it took us over an hour before they let us in. The Gate keeper I would call him came over and told us if we wanted to tip the host $20 per male they would let us in right now and at this point there was only 4 people in front of us. So if we paid this extra $20, we would be @ $430 instead of $310 just to get in the front door. Then at there desertion, they would let people go straight in with no wait or maybe they just had more money than our group and could pay the $'s needed to skip the line. The good part is, that once we got in we spent over $1,000 in drinks and had a blast. The sad part is I would never go back to this club because of there greed. I mean really, you would think that they would be happy you picked their Club for a special night for our daughters 21st and that we traveled all the way from California. When I told the Gate Keeper that it was my daughters 21st, he didn't even seem to care one bit. When we go to Las Vegas for my next daughters 21st, I will make sure if we go to this Club again we contact someone there that actually appreciates your business. People running this club will end up costing the owners money and maybe they already make so much that they really don't care. Great Club, poor Gate Keepers..",1.0

It does not need to be cut in half.  No response but an apology will fix this.  I don't need any excuses about how it is cut or nothing like that.

"Every year around this time my family goes  on a quest for a Friday night fish fry.  Having grown up in Wisconsin, where Friday night fish fry's are as much a part of the culture as ice fishing, brandy old fashioned's and  watching the Packers on Sunday during football season, I fancy myself as having a tad bit of knowledge of what a good fish fry should be. 

So far in my annual fish fry quest, I have had moderate success at best--until last week.   As part of my quest, we went to The Groves last Friday to try out their Friday night fish fry.  They offer an individual plate or all you can eat for $2.00 more (we current and former Wisconsinites don't get these great looking physiques by only eating one plate of fried fish).  So I opted for the all you can eat.  This covers only fish, I'm guessing if you want additional fries, hush puppies or cole slaw, that is extra, but I'm here for the fish. 

I was very pleased with the meal.  The fish is a lightly battered cod with a very good flavor.  It is not the overwhelming pile of breading with a little fish stuffed somewhere in the mess that I have come across on occasion.  The pieces are not huge, so they are evenly cooked throughout, however the staff was very attentive and ensured we always had fish at the table.  The meal came with hush puppies, fries and some coleslaw, all of which tasted good, but I wasn't there for the sides.  

While there were other things that looked appealing on the menu, I had to stick to the fish, but we will definitely be back.",1.0

"My wife and I have made it a recent tradition to try and surprise one another on\/around our birthdays. My wife knows I love Japanese food and picked shin bay to celebrate my 32nd a few weeks ago. She did well...

This place is small, unassuming, and tucked into the strip mall across from the train park. Reservations are a must as there are very few tables and it's a very popular place. Service was great and the food...oh the food.

I won't do the food any justice in this review. I will do my best. We did a 4\/5 course tasting menu. 

First course: a crudo (Black Sea bass maybe?) in a sauce of ponzu, grape seed oil and what I imagine unicorn tears to taste like. Every bite had savory, citrus, salty, and slight fishy flavor. Absolutely amazing dish.

Second course: clams in a mushrooms broth. Simple, fresh, delicious. I sipped up all the broth.

Third course: wygu beef strips that you cook on a small hibachi grill. Served with asparagus and a delicious sauce. Another perfect dish.

Fourth course: the sushi course. 6 great pieces. All great.

Fifth course: a Japanese crem brûlée. One of my favorite deserts so this was a nice surprise.

I finished the night with a Japanese whiskey. I'm a bit of a whiskey freak and this stuff hit the spot. Not sure what it was called but our server said it was recommended by the chef. Again, a perfect choice.

"I rarely write reviews online. However, the dish they served today was just beyond acceptable. The dish's name was spicy incense pot. 

First, instead of using chilli, the dish used chilli seeds to create spicy flavor. The dish was covered with hundreds or thousands of chilli seeds. This choice was just surprising. I lived in China for more than twenty years and had been to many Sichuan and Hunan restaurants. None of them use chilli seeds only in their dishes. This definitely cut their cost but it created a very bad feeling when chewing the dish.

Second, the majority of the dish is green pepper, potato, and oinion. Are you kidding? Potato is the only valid material for spicy incense pot. The rest two can never taste good in spicy incense pot. Again, they probably just want to cut the cost.

Third, I found two or three shrimps and a few squid rolls, which constituted all the meat in the dish. However, the shrimps were not fresh at all. I can't tell the quality of those squid rolls. 

All in all, I ordered a dish that has become very popular in Chinese restaurants in the last few years, expecting some spicy food of average quality. However, the dish I ate today was really disappointing. In fact, I could not even finish the dish because of tons of chilli seeds all over every piece of potato, green pepper, and onion. I walked out very hungry.",1.0
"Had lunch at the Glendale location today. It had been quite a long time since I'd eaten at Pei Wei. It's not the same quality as it was when it opened. In the beginning...the food was barely second to that served at a PF Changs. It was quite good, easy to access and everything that accompanied the food was higher quality (drinks, napkins, fortune cookies, staff\/bussers).

I ordered a small chicken orange peel with brown rice ($6.49) and my BF ordered the large shrimp kung pao ($9.99) and we also ordered 2 side spring rolls $3.79. I believe the smaller portion option is new to Pei Wei as I'm sure they're trying to capture a larger market w\/less expensive prices or portions. For lunch, the small is just fine for most, especially if you get an extra little side with it. 

BUT...HERE'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SMALL AND ORIGINAL PORTION SIZE..YOU PAY MORE FOR ADD'L RICE WHEN YOU ORDER THE ORIGINAL, NOT ADD'L MEAT.

Plate next to plate my BF had the same amount of meat (shrimp) in comparison to my (chicken)...his plate was larger and it had more than twice the amount of rice on my plate. So comparing apples to apples you pay $2 to $2.20 more for MORE rice, not necessarily more meat when you order an original vs a small depending on what kind of meat you order.

- We settled for original since there was no GRILLED.

All I know was  I paid $16.73 and that is TOO MUCH for how much I got.  This is ROBBERY!

"Allgemein
Tokio Dining - ein Kleinod japanischer Küchenkunst in Stuttgart, nicht nur für Japanophile
Bedienung
Das gesamte Service-Team des Tokio Dining hat alle 5 Sterne absolut verdient.
Das Lokal war voll besetzt an dem Abend, trotzdem lief alles reibungslos und ohne lange Wartezeit.
Der Service ist stets aufmerksam und präsent, unaufdringlich, schnell, sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit.
In Japan mag das nicht besonders erwähnenswert erscheinen, aber hier ist es doch angenehm besonders, und verdient deswegen auch ausdrückliche Erwähnung.
Alle Gerichte werden auf Wunsch genau beschrieben, schnell und ausgesprochen freundlich serviert, leere Gefäße sofort abgeräumt. Hier sitzt kein Gast vor leeren Gläsern. Auch bei der Abrechnung wurden wir vorher freundlich gefragt, wie bezahlt werden möchte. Getrennte Rechnungen sind hier absolut kein Problem.
Einem solchen Team gibt man gerne mehr als das übliche Trinkgeld.
Das Essen
Das Essen im Tokio Dining ist sehr authentisch und es gibt nicht nur die üblichen ""Sushi-Standards"".
Hier macht es richtig Spaß die reichhaltige Speisekarte rauf und runter zu bestellen, denn es werden viele besondere Japan-Schmankerl angeboten.
Köstlich der Kaiso-Salat (Seetangsalat), die Takoyaki (Japanische Knödel).
Die Tokio Dining Gyoza (gebratene japanische Maultaschen) sind der Hammer, eine Köstlichkeit vom allerfeinsten mit extrem hohem Suchtfaktor, so dass wir sie gleich nochmal bestellt haben.
Die Sushi, Nigiri, Maki, Uramaki und Futomaki waren alle superfrisch und sehr lecker. Die Futomaki sind besonders groß und diesbezüglich auch sehr günstig. Das Sashimi-Set mit Lachs und Thunfisch war herrlich frisch, mit je vier richtig großen Stücken von ca 30 Gramm. Für die Menge ist der Preis sehr angemessen.
Die Don-Portionen sind eher etwas für den großen Hunger. Auch die Tellergerichte sind reichlich bemessen.
Sehr lecker war das Yakiudon (gebratene Udon-Nudeln mit Gemüse und Schweinefleisch).
Mega-lecker das Okonomiyaki mit Schweinefleisch, was man selten in Deutschland bekommt.
Das Dessert war sehr schön angerichtet und lecker.
Das Ambiente
Unscheinbar in einem ruhigen Wohnviertel gelegen betritt man ""Klein Japan"".
Das Tokio Dining mit 45 Plätzen relativ klein und sehr gemütlich.
Das Interieur des Restaurants ist schlicht, hell und unaufdringlich, mit kleinen liebevollen Details aus Japan.
Es gibt hübsche Kleinigkeiten zu entdecken, viele davon sind sehr typisch japanisch, wie zum Beispiel handgenähte Untersetzer für Getränke.

I tried the Ryan's roll which was pretty good. It reminded me of a standard crunchy roll, but this one cost like $15, so I don't know if I would get it again. The Screaming Orgasm was really good too and the small portion was only $10. The seared tuna was good and I would probably get it again.

Ordered the soft pretzels, just to try out two dips that intrigued us - the candied jalapeño cream cheese and the truffle mustard. I was not a fan of the cream cheese because I don't like the heat, but my husband took it down! The truffle mustard was good, more of a finely-ground, stone-ground mustard that had a smooth finish. Smacked the sour and bitter taste buds all around! 

Our meal was a split burger and side - the BBQ burger and the broccoli salad. 

My thoughts on the burger:
The first thing I noticed was the doneness; as I cut the burger in twain, the juices flowed into the lower bun and onto the plate. YES. This is a medium rare burger! Probably the first correct one I've had all summer!

Thick strips of bacon, not too over-peppered, and still with a bit of chewiness. Tasty. 
The BBQ suave was on the savory side, most notably from the pepper, then what I think is a smidge of onion powder. All mingling together nicely on this fine burger. 
The bun: surprised it wasn't toasted, but that is all. 

Broccoli Salad:
Boasting a soy-wasabi dressing, this chilled salad rocks the salty buds. It is truly covered with this sauce, assumably, it's been brining\/marinating in it. Mostly soy sauce flavored, it didn't have the wasabi punch I was expecting. Good, nonetheless. 

I suggest giving this place a try. My hubby and I are taking the afternoon to compare this and Bubba's in Bridgeville (both new to us). We'll let you know the winner later!",1.0
"After lengthy research for a contractor to install pavers in my courtyard, I found Alco Landcape.

"Visited The Keg on Trafalgar on January 20th, 2014 at 4PM. We were celebrating a special occasion and decided to return to this Keg because of positive prior experiences.

It was our last visit. Here's why:

-The hostess had great difficulty extracting a greeting.
-The menus were filthy and ragged.
-We had empty plates sit on our table for over 10 minutes.
-There was some type of fly that kept hovering over our table.
-We ordered garlic shrimp which arrived as a gooey mess. It was an entirely new flavour and certainly was neither garlicky nor buttery. 
- We asked for the bill and the server returned with it stating that ""since we were in such a rush"" the complimentary (and pre-made\/brought in) cheesecake was packed to go.
-Around 3 AM I awoke with bad stomach cramps.

"I've been visiting Giselle at Lora Moon Styling for about 5 months now.  She has changed my life in regard to my hairstyle and cut, since she's been working with me!  She suggested a different cut and a GK Treatment to manage my frizzy, unmanageable hair. Both have made such a difference in my life.  Although I live in Albuquerque, I prefer to have Giselle take care of my hair.  She has made a difference in my life.  Her products are gentle to my hair and her techniques are amazing!

"Pros
- The food was delicious
- The warm welcome from the staff upon entry is a very nice touch
- Great decor

Cons
- Our party of 16 was assigned a table that seated no more than 12. I had to sit sideways on the bench to accommodate everyone
- Portions per dish are very small. Though I appreciate gourmet tapas, $10 for a fistful of spinach with a couple of mushrooms is a stretch
- Our bill wasn't split, forcing us to divvy a $670 bill ourselves
- One member of our party wasn't served at all after 2 hours of waiting
- Ordering the grapefruit cocktail gets you a vodka\/soda, grapefruit half and citrus juicer. Very original, but insufficient juice and less labor leaves you wondering why you paid the mark up.

Overall
Maybe the moral of our story is to avoid going in a large group. Cramped seating, divvied portions and a single bill all point towards the restaurant's inexperience in dealing with parties larger than 5. Though I loved the food, the value and the service will prevent me from re-visiting.",1.0

No where near their normal quality. I have had better tv dinners. Refused to allow me to speak to manager.

"When you think of the word ""Tenors"" the first thing that comes to mind is opera. For these guys, you are only partially right. 

Located inside the Shimmer Cabaret which is a part of the LVH Casino, I took my family and some friends to this show expecting nothing but opera songs. What we got was way more than pleasantly expected.

From the very first minute these guys came on stage they were crooning out tunes from tv shows, songs from the 60's, 70's' 80's, and yes of course broadway opera songs. I want to point out the fact that these guys came from totally different backgrounds and genre's. When they sing together its like going to your favorite restaurant, ordering something completely different that you never had before and discovering that it was awesome!

I will be the first to admit that I am not one for opera but was willing to check these guys out since my wife was a fan of opera. Turns out the whole family not just became fans of it, but became fans of these guys in general regardless if they sang opera or not. Individually when any one of these guys sing, they have their own style and flare about them. When they sing together, it all sounds so crisp and clean with the harmony that they have. For now they are singing to instrumentals and they already sound great. They said later on down the road they are hoping on getting a live band to play behind them. I can only imagine just how much more awesome they will sound with that! Nothing beats a live band!

After the show they hang out in the lobby for photo ops and just overall mingling. They also have CD's available for purchase just in case you want to listen to more of their dynamics. All 3 of these guys are very friendly and very appreciative that you would take the time out to watch them in action. They are as humble as they are talented.

So in closing, describing these guys just will not do any justice in comparison to seeing them live doing their thing. I am already planning on seeing them again and bringing others with me!

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #152 ""It's not what you think",1.0
Love this airport. It may not be the largest international airport but it sure does have a great selection of restaurants (inside and outside of security) and it is very easy to navigate.,1.0
"When we heard one of our new favourite artists was going to play at Coda, we jumped on the chance to get tickets. The show ended up being sold out in a matter of hours.  When we arrived, I was worried. The line up was massive! We asked the bouncers if there was a line for ticket holders and they kindly told us it was the empty line behind the big one. We walked right in.

ID, security, ticket taking, coat check, all took a matter of seconds. The first thing I noticed was that everyone knew everyone in this club! All I saw was people running up to other people, high fives, smiling faces, hugs. I could already tell this place had a great community and a great vibe. I also noticed that you could dance ANYWHERE. If there is a cushioned box to sit on, you can dance on it. If there is open space by the bar, you dance there. If there is a bottle service booth near you, you can dance there too. Security is not uptight about keeping the booths separate from the regular crowd. 

With a sold out show, I was worried that the space would soon be limited. It was about 12:30 and I asked a girl beside me what to expect. She said ""This is it!"" I had so much room to dance! Coda does not cram people into their club like sardines. Thank goodness. In addition to this, the people who attend this club have respect for personal space. As a side note, the bathrooms were consistently clean with lots of stalls which is a big plus. 

So here I am, having the best night in a LONG time, its getting kind of late, we are getting tired, and maybe a bit hungry. But what is this? A fruit kebob is put in front of my face. Yes, that's right. Coda was providing fruit to its concert goers to ensure everyone was nourished in the wee hours of the night. The bowl is simply passed around from person to person. 

At the end of the night I was pleasantly surprised to see that security was controlling the coat check line and maintained order so it didn't become a mob. I think what really makes Coda so fantastic is the fact that security is so on point. 

All in all, the music is amazing (tech house, techno, deep house), the sound is the best in the city, the people exude some wicked vibes, and the staff are attentive. I will be coming back to Coda the first chance I get.

Leave the bangers and the kandi at home, Coda is electronic music without the nonsense.",1.0
"I've been to LE BURGER BRASSERIE a few times since I stay at the Paris often for work. The burgers are decent, they've got sports on several TVs, and a decent list of craft brews at ok prices for Vegas standards.

The service is rather shaky. Last time there was good and bad. Horrid horrid service, the broad got three of our four beer orders wrong. She lost our credit card for a short while. But she was hot...

"Charlotte Russe is one of my favorite stores and I definitely recommend this one rather than the outlet one near the strip. Their merchandise is always set up nice and it's a really fun atmosphere. Their customer service pretty much met my standards, greeted me when I walked in, asked me if I was looking for anything in particular and to let them know if I needed any help and was very pleasant about it. When I tried some stuff on it didn't take long for someone to count my items and give me a room which is always a plus.",1.0

"Food was ok.  We walked into the west door and waited for a few minutes and no one came to us. Apparently we were suppose to walk in thru the eastern door. 

The waitress was quick to get our order but it took almost 45 for our order to come out. We were told the kitchen was backed up. It would have been helpful if we had been told in advance.  The place was not so busy that this was warranted. 

They only take cash but have an ATM on site. The ATM displays your financial information after you get your money.  There's a delay.  The guy in front of me walked away and all of his financial information was up for me to see until I pressed ok on the ATM. Horrible.

"This was something I have always wanted to do, and my husband and I bought a package deal through Viator.com. Two of us flew for just $399.
I don't understand why some people complain about the experience here. It was wonderful! Yes, you get up early, that's why it's a SUNRISE flight.  Yes, they ask you to help with the set up and take down, but that is part of the experience you pay for, if you are not willing to help, or not physically able to help, that's okay. They have crew to do the work. To me, not helping would be like vacationing at a Dude Ranch and never riding a horse or roping a cow. I guess some people need to complain.
The first time we scheduled our flight, we were cancelled out the night before, due to expected high winds. The winds didn't come, but better safe than sorry.
The second time we scheduled, all went according to plan.
Sheldon was our pilot, and he was friendly, funny and informative. The other members of his crew were very outgoing and fun, as well. 
I want to note that my husband and I are a gay couple and we have been together for 19 years. We tend to still be a bit uncomfortable in new situations where we are not certain how we will be accepted. Well, we were made very welcome by the crew and other passengers. In our group of 6 other passengers, there was another young gay couple, on their honeymoon, and they were made to feel welcome, as well. Our flight was smooth and the vistas were breathtaking. There was romance on the flight, as well, as a young man popped the question to his girlfriend at 2000 feet over the city. She, of course, said yes!
Our Pilot, Sheldon, pointed out areas of interest and kept us thoroughly entertained.
I expected to be a little frightened, but wasn't. There is no feeling of instability in that balloon basket. None. I felt safe and secure and didn't want it to end.
We DID have a rough landing, however, as we ""bounced"" a couple of times and the basket tipped over on it's side. We were instructed how to prepare for such a landing before we took off, and while the landing was exciting, I never once felt like we were in any danger.
We had cheese, crackers and champagne after our flight, and camaraderie and laughter was very evident, as we had just shared a remarkable experience.

I went in for my first visit and was told they would check with insurance to see what is covered and then give me a call. They called two weeks later and told me which procedure would be covered. I asked what my deductible was and she said I did not have one. So I TRUSTED her and booked my appointment. I would say the procedure was ok. I still have numbing in the spot where it was done but was told that is a side effect. The part which led me to write a review (which I never do) is the fact that I received a very expensive bill from them. They were wrong about what my insurance would cover. I called billing department and was told it was my fault for not checking with insurance. So lesson learned. I just want others to have a heads up before booking procedures.,1.0
"Cox is getting out of hand with their fees. Went into this store to pick up high definition box. Clerk was quick to add the box onto my account, along with the fee, but too dumb to add the box serial number onto my account for it to be activated.

"I highly recommend Jeffrey Gronich. I needed an attorney for my unemployment appeal hearing. I was appealing the denial of unemployment benefits by my former employer. Jeffrey was referred to me by a friend and employment is his specific area of practice. I was very nervous and unsure about the process. I had never been fired and I had never needed an attorney. 

    Upon meeting with Jeffrey, I immediately felt at ease and knew that he was truly interested in helping me. He listened to what had transpired between myself and my employer and looked over all my documents patiently. He was able to break everything down to me in a very conscience way and put things into realistic perspective. Jeffrey was calm, personable, witty and very professional. But most of all, he was confident in his knowledge of the law and his ability to adequately represent my case in the hearing. 

    When we came before the unemployment referee, Jeffrey represented me perfectly. He was well-versed in the specifics of my case and every detail of the law pertaining to my claim. My former employer had presented multiple reasons for my termination that were bogus and irrelevant to my being terminated. Jeffrey was able to cross examine my Boss and discount each one of the claims against me. 

    I won my appeal and got all my benefits. I know that I would not have been successful alone in the hearing. Jeffrey simply did an amazing job. He was always easy to contact, patient and generous with his time and fair. If you are appealing your unemployment, do not go alone. It is too stressful and emotional to represent yourself. There is so much of the process and law that is involved, you need an employment attorney. 

    I would highly recommend Jeffrey Gronich to anyone. He understands the blue collar worker, unions and casinos, as he worked in gaming, as a dealer prior to becoming an attorney. He worked to get where he is and is not an ""out for your money type"". He is down to earth, professional, hard working and an animal lover. He became an attorney for the right reasons and wants to help. There is no way I could have done it without him. Great honest attorney.",1.0

"An amazing yoga studio - the best I've been to and not sure when I'll come across one better. 

A couple of expectations when entering Y2:
1. It's a very aerobic hot vinyasa yoga studio, with the exception of a few introductory and meditative classes.  Come with the expectation to move rigorously and sweat plentifully when taking any of the Y2 Double Shot, Y2 Single Shot or Y2 Remix classes.
2. People get cozy.  During peak hours and class times for popular instructors, you will find the studio abound with energetic students ready to practice in what will likely be a full house.  Granted, a few classes can become uncomfortably sardine-packed on occasion (as students are never turned away) but people almost always find ways to make room and do their best in embracing a positive and open-minded attitude.  That's what yoga's all about anyway, isn't it?

Now that I no longer live in beautiful Charlotte, NC, I am wistful for the great perks unique to Y2.
1. Awesome assists - the instructors here are well versed in what they do and have great confidence their assists all around, which are frequent and fantastic.  Tanner, Kacy, Dorie and Katie are especially aware about consistently helping students explore deeper into and\/or adjusting their poses.  I know that I certainly have room for improvement throughout each pose and each class, so it's really nice having that guidance. 
2. Great music - I love music and I love listening to great music while working out. That's what you get at Y2.  Yes, at times a Top 40 song will play on an instructor's iPod that you hear all too often, but you have also a variety of remixes of songs that energize you and keep you pumped, some of which you've never heard before.  Coming from NY and ATL, I loved classes with Shanna because she always makes sure to play Hip Hop and R&B (among other genres) in all her classes.
3. Lavender-scented (or rather soaked) cool toilettes. Need I say more.  There are few things more gratifying than cooling down with a chilled towel during final shavasana and wiping yourself down with it afterwards.  You'd think every hot yoga would have this given its sweaty and sometimes smelly nature - nope! 
4. New and interesting poses.  Although ""Y2 Remix"" is a class specifically described as each instructor's opportunity to show their own style, most teachers make a conscious effort to change it up in every class anyway. You'll be doing different takes of standing and floor series while encouraged to explore variations at any time.  I love that aspect of Y2's atmosphere.  

Y2 is very much a positive, fun and athletic community.  I appreciated that Charlie and Michael at reception quickly learned my name and would greet me at each visit.  I continue to regularly practice hot vinyasa yoga in Minneapolis but alas, each studio and each city is different. I wish I could experience Y2 in their new studio, which looks like it's coming along very nicely but no worries - I'll be visiting sometime soon. :)",1.0
"I love the Gyro, fries and drink combo.....you can't go wrong with the old number 1. Their Gyro is very good and always if a fresh pita. It is worth making a trip here for the fries alone. They are done up perfect! For sure this is a work place hang out during lunch time.

The whole place is rather worn down and in need of a facelift, and the bathrooms could certainly do with a better cleaning job.

"You know, it amazes me that people come to (for example) a Hungarian restaurant and then complain that the meal isn't served with North American condiments. Really?? Are these the same people who go to Japanese restaurants and get mad if there aren't any McDonald's cheeseburgers on the menu? To avoid foolish expectations, I'd suggest doing your research beforehand. In this day and age, most people have and iphone\/android and it would take all of what, 3 seconds to search ""typical Hungarian meal"" in order to know that that's what they'd be getting. Please don't apply North American expectations or we'll be stuck with every restaurant ""Americanizing"" their food and that would just be sad. Rant over.

This is traditional Hungarian food. The traditional fruity drink made w a red syrup and water is yummo! Have the cucumber salad (tangy and sweet) and if they have the mushroom soup (everything is homemade here), try it. A tasty broth with fresh mushrooms. Light and satisfying. Then get the schnitzel (I like to forego the bread and add mashed potatoes instead). Ask for extra lemon wedges to squeeze it over the light, flavourful meat. So delicately breaded and perfectly browned, you'd swear that you're having breaded fish. For dessert (you won't have room but get it anyway) order the walnut crepes. Oh, and did I mention? Our server was excellent, always filling our water glasses, checking to see that everything was okay without being annoyingly hovering.Cash only.

"So this company looks like a company but its actually one guy. One guy answers the scheduling line and the customer service line. The same man comes and cleans the carpets. I used him to shampoo the carpets in my rental. Only $60 for 4 rooms and the hallway.. i should have known it was too cheap. When he arrived he immediately tried to charge me double. He must have used a dirty brush because after the carpets dried there was white hairs all over the carpets, looked like from a dog. There was no dog living in the house previously. I even suggested to him to vacuum before he shampooed. Fifteen minutes later he emptied out the dirty gross water from his hose right in front of the house!!! I had to ask him to hose it down the street.  I called him and asked if he could go back and at least vacuum up the mess since his website clearly states 100% satisfaction guarantee.

"Went to Main event for the second time on Sunday. We tried to take the kids there on Saturday evening but it was so packed that we didn't think the unlimited laser tag, bowling, billboards and gravity ropes would be worth it. We came on Sunday afternoon instead. It was a good move as it wasn't too crowded. The deal was $15.95\/person from 12-4 pm. We got there at 1 and went straight into a 15 minute game of laser tag. When it was over we went to sign up for another round. Since it wasn't super busy the girl at the counter signed us up for three straight rounds. It was really cool as we didn't even have to take off the gear for 45 minutes. All in all, we played 5 rounds of laser tag and a bunch of video games. The kids had a blast. Tons of fun. Didn't bowl or anything else this trip because the laser tag is what the kids wanted to do. However, when we arrived it looked like there were plenty of lanes available. It was definitely more crowded as you got closer to 4pm. Will be back.",1.0
"I came here last night for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised... I am not a fan of Mexican food and had frequented the Firefly that was previously here so I was not quite sure to expect. 

They have a decent happy hour menu - $5 dollar house margaritas (and they didn't skimp on booze). I was happy with the food on the happy hour menu as it wasn't all carbs. I had the ceviche and I have no complaints. The grilled corn tempted me too.

I don't really have anything negative to say. Perhaps they could have free chips and salsa? (I was always a fan of the bread\/weird butter at Firefly)

I would go back.. and I know my friends definitely will (they live much closer).",1.0
"I came here last Saturday after volunteering. My choice was the chicken Alfredo with breadsticks. Very pleasant, creamy taste. As soon as they finished preparing it, they brought it out.

"Best. Macarons. Ever.

Every time I visit a new city, the first thing I look for are French cafés with macarons. This new place popped up at the top of my Edinburgh search, and I'm so glad!!

It is obvious that a lot of love (and fresh ingredients) go into their wonderful macarons. They taste supremely fresh and luscious. I was particularly excited with the interesting flavors presented in the Hendricks Gin and Innis & Gunn Beer macarons. Their more traditional flavors (lavender, salted caramel, chocolate, strawberry chocolate) were also great. 

However, I was rendered near speechless by their positively exquisite Earl Grey macarons. They taste just as the name suggests with the perfect level of sweetness you'd expect from a macaron. You can even see the tiny specs of tea in the filling. O.M.G. Can you have a religious experience with a macaron? Seriously, try them.

They also have make a tasty espresso and have cute outside seating with a nice view of the castle. The perfect accoutrement to those macarons.

"I rented some gear for a gig and called a week before to book the rental. 

I paid upfront with my credit card over the phone for the rental but when I got to the store I was charged a surprise $40 ""holding fee"". Confused seeing as I paid in full up front I was informed that the fee was to guarantee that the gear I had already paid for would be held for me. Huh? Apparently paying upfront in full does not guarantee that the gear will be there which makes absolutely no sense.  Unless of course you pay them an extra $40 for nothing. 

I pleaded with the guy to forgo the unfair, undiscussed hidden charge and he smugly said ""Do you want the gear or not pal?"". Had I not had a gig in three hours I would have walked. To make matters worse they initially showed me a piece of gear that was like new but then gave me one with missing knobs and beer spilled all over it. I only noticed when I got to the car and had to go back in and exchange it. They thought it was funny. Nice. 

I will never go back to L&M and now happily take my business else where and for better rental prices too I might add.",1.0

Seems like they're doing well considering it's only been 6 months since they opened. Very friendly staff and overall a cozy ambience for larger groups or families.",1.0
"I'll admit I was pretty skeptical of this place due to it's location and overall outside appearance but boy was I wrong. I just want to say a huge THANK YOU to the staff, doctors, and the student intern who helped me at this clinic. I've never felt so comfortable and well taken care of. 

I have a Holland lop bunny so I had a difficult time looking for a clinic who knows how to properly care for rabbits. Not to say that other clinics are bad but most vets focus on cats and dogs (which is understandable). I found this clinic via Google and I'm so glad that I found them!! They have convenient hours and a very knowledgeable and caring staff. Best of all, they have bunny boarding at extremely reasonable prices! They also have ferret and cat boarding for those who are wondering.

Located inside the cancer hospital this restaurant actually takes you away from feeling like you're inside a hospital.  They have a great selection of salads and sandwiches.

"First time dining here tonight. I almost turned around and walked out right after I walked in because you get the feeling it is a fast casual restaurant (which is fine for lunch) but they are a full service restaurant with full bar service and everything. In fact, I was overjoyed to learn that they have Peroni on tap!  Yay for me!  So we split the Mediterranean Salad (mid-sized tier is easily enough for 2-3 people). That was delicious. For the entrees we had the Lasagne and the Bolognese with Penne (build your own pasta) and added meatballs. The meatballs were nice and tender as they should be. The sauces were also nice and rich consistency. I had the lasagne, which was very tasty albeit a little bit on the skimpy portion size. Enough for most I suppose but if that was all I ordered I would've still been hungry. In addition, I prefer the multi-layered pan style. This was more ""spread out"" style in a flat pan and then covered with sauce and then topped with mozzarella cheese.  Nice presentation though!  Since we had a fabulous time and didn't want to leave yet (our server Tessa made our night a lot of fun) we finished our 24 ounce beers (ice cold still) and decided to take the tiramisu home with us. We'll definitely be back.",1.0
Amazing service! They took me as I desperately pulled in 3 minutes before closing. I was about to embark on a big road trip the next day and they made sure I was going to be 100% safe at a price my college student wallet could be happy with! They worked with me and explained everything in detail and showed me ways to take care of my car myself on the road! Soooo great! Will always come back to this location!,1.0
"I've been to this and the other location a few times. I've got to say that I'm surprised that I'm able to get good seafood from a bar. I love oysters so $1 oyster night on Thursdays is great to take advantage of. The service is decent enough. I mean it is a bar so I don't expect super tentative service or anything but the servers are always nice. The prices aren't too bad either. 

I had the lobster roll. Now it's not big chunks of lobster meat like I'm used to. It's a lobster salad (which it does state in the menu) with mayo and celery. However there is a good amount of meat in the roll and it is tasty. When given the option of fries I chose garlic. Those were very good as well. They use a fresh make garlic butter with minced garlic over the fries. As far as drinks go, my mother had a mandarin cosmo which was delicious. I've had good experiences with this place so far and will continue to come back.",1.0

"The only appealing part about this place is the 24\/7 service. If you want a late night manicure than this place is basically the only option, however in my opinion it's better to just wait until morning so you can go somewhere else. 

Gel manicures normally run $25-$30, however at this salon it's $40. Which to start with is crazy over priced, but worse than that, the woman I worked with made me pay before I actually got any polish put on. It was very odd and very uncomfortable, how am I suppose to tip on a service I haven't had yet? Plus I feel as though you should always pay after so you actually know what you're paying for. 

 My nails are nicely shaped and the police came out with the good strong color I was hoping for. However none of that was really the manicurists doing, my nails were basically already shaped and I picked red polish, you can't really screw up that color. 

The manicure portion of the manicure was quick and to the point, she even almost forgot to buff my nails and had to call me back before I washed my hands. 

As I said before the polish came out on well but at the end there was no lotion or hand massage that you would normally get. So I basically dropped $40 just to get my nails painted. Which in my mind is a rip off since I can get that and more for $25.",1.0

"Who reviews a surgeon? I do! It is important.  I had lasik performed by Dr. Wellish in November of 2012. Since then, I have recommended him to friends and coworkers.  I was really impressed by their friendly, efficient and professional service. I have had good results and still am sometimes amazed that I can see without any correction. This is the best thing I have done for myself in years. 

They have different surgery options and I went with the one that gives you 20\/20 vision. They have one that is more expensive but gives you super hero vision. I decided to pass, since it seemed unnecessary. 

Dr. Wellish was recommended to me by optometrist and I can't thank him enough.  I was moving out of state just a couple of days after my surgery, so they made arrangements for me to see my regular optometrist for my first followup, then I came back to him for the next one. That extra step, and the fact that the doctor himself called me the night of my surgery really reinforced that I made the right decision. Fantastic service, great results!

"I brought in my 2002 Ford Taurus in last august for a no start concern. it was frustrating to begin with seeing as how my father and I are both mechanics and couldn't figure out the problem. our service writer was friendly and helpful but in the end we spent over 1,700$ on a new PCM, Alternator, Battery, O2 sensors, the works which took about a week to finish. Obviously we bought the one year warranty on that kind of work. Now being august of 2014 I have gone in 7 times. 3 for simple oil changes, transmission flushes ect. but the other 4 times were for replacing the same ""PCM"" issues. As a graduate from the College of Southern Nevada with an Associates of Automotive Technology degree i know that these sort of electrical issues can become a nightmare for any mechanic, I figured with the amazing shop and tools they have this issue would have been fixed the first time.

I wasn't looking for anything in particular at first, but I quickly remembered an old board game that I use to play as a kid (Tornado Rex, anyone?!).

We spent over $3,000 dollars on a vanity, kitchen sink, 2 faucets and a Toto toilet. The vanity didn't arrive at their store until 6 weeks or more after we had ordered it.

"This place is an example of how things can go awry if expectations and experience are out of whack--and not in the right direction.  I visited for lunch today on a bike ride--I'd seen their signs on the path, so I looked them up on Yelp, and saw that most people seem to like them.  I also looked up their menu ahead of time, and saw that they offer soup in a bread bowl and macaroni and cheese--two of my favorite comfort foods with particular appeal at this time of year, when it's getting cooler.  According to their website, they're open on Sat. until noon, so I timed my ride so I could stop by.

Upon finding the place (which took some doing), I walked in and stood by the counter. There were several other customers, and one employee was busy getting their food, and the other (an owner\/manager, I assume) was chatting with them (I assume they're regulars).  After several minutes, the owner\/manager asked me if I'd been helped, and I told him I hadn't, so he asked me if I'd prefer to eat in or take out, and I told him I'd like to eat in.  He told me I could have a seat and the other employee would be right with me to take my order, so I picked a table and sat down.  The table had a menu at it labeled ""Saturday Menu"" that had the same selections listed as the website.  When the other employee came over after a couple of minutes, I asked her what soups they had.  She explained that they don't offer soups on Sat.  Unfazed, I asked her about getting a sandwich\/side combo, and she told me that they don't offer sides on Sat., either.  She then proceeded to tell me that they only offer breakfast and lunch sandwiches on Sat.  (Umm, then why are sides, soup, etc. listed on the ""Saturday Menu?"")  I asked her if she had a recommendation, and she said that she liked all the sandwiches she'd tried.  I asked her what she thought of the muffaletta, and she said she hadn't tried it yet, but since I hadn't ever had one, I decided to order it.

The sandwich came out after a few minutes. According to Wikipedia, muffalettas are traditionally served cold, but can be heated--this one came as a panini.  I thought the flavor was decent, though, as I mentioned, I don't have a standard to judge by.  When I finished, my waitress came by and asked if I wanted anything else.  Since this place is known for their baked goods, I checked what was available, and a cinnamon roll muffin caught my eye, so I decided to get it.  Without asking if I'd like it boxed up for takeout, the owner\/manager boxed it up, so I paid and left.  Upon arriving home, I heated the muffin briefly (as the owner\/manager suggested) proceeded to eat it.  The first bite was stale and bland, and I couldn't taste any cinnamon.  Even the middle of the muffin contained very little cinnamon--the only saving grace was the cream cheese icing.  Since it was the last one, I'm guessing that the muffin had been sitting around since at least yesterday. As someone who's no stranger to eating several-day-old baked goods, this muffin didn't age well.

Overall, I'm sorry to say that this was a rather disappointing lunch, in light of the lack of selection and food quality.  I'm guessing that the food selection and quality--and possibly also the service--is much better during weekdays.  Unfortunately, I live and work (9-5) in Oakland, so it's impractical for me to visit during weekdays.  While I applaud the owners for opening the business in an out of the way location and for having some weekend hours, I'd advise them to be upfront about item availability on Sat.  If you're only going to serve sandwiches and breakfast items on Sat., then please make a Sat. menu that includes only these items and post it on the website and at the tables.  If you're going to bill yourself as a cakery, then please offer at least some fresh baked goods every day (including Sat.).  As for potential customers, while this place may be worth visiting on weekdays, I'd advise you to stay away on Sat. until the management makes some changes. 2.5 stars.",1.0

"This place waters down their botox.  They reel you in with a 89$ special for the first 20 units (you always need more than 20)  then they charge 11$ a unit for the rest- which is fine, IF the botox wasn't watered down.  But it is!

I've had botox twice before done by Plastic Surgeons, both times it kicked in within 4 days and lasted an entire 6 months.  Botox can last anywhere from 3-6 months.

I got my botox at Beauty Bar a few month ago, and I found it odd that the nurse who injected me said that botox never lasts more than 3 months and that if I work out, it leaves your system even faster.. Almost like she was prepping me so that in less than 2 months when my botox was GONE I would think it was normal.  

Sure enough- the botox took 2 whole weeks to kick in, and even then it wasn't as ""tight"" as it should have been.  Within less than 8 weeks, the effects of the botox were completely gone.

"To say I am excited to finally have Changing Hands closer to me is an understatement.  The west valley is in major need of so many Indie businesses and thank goodness we have an Indie bookstore in the 'hood.  I was beyond nervous when I first donated money for the opening of this location and there mere days before it ended and several thousand were still needed.  But the community came through and from there I eyeballed the countdown like nobody's business!  

My friend and I went to their opening night and we were not let down at all.  The parking lot was plenty big enough to fit everyone and the open space the bookstore is in has that warehouse feel to it complete with the 2 original fireplaces from Beefeaters.  The First Draft Book Bar is a very welcome addition to this location and I'm pretty sure I will be the owner of one of the bar glasses and T-shirts!  There is a large open space right behind the bar that looks to possibly be the spot for all the author visits and signings.  They won't have to move any bookshelves!  I can't wait!...especially since I was nervous they wouldn't host any events at our Phoenix location when I first heard it was going in.  Thankfully, they will start hosting events here in August (they held off not knowing if they would be open by then).  In fact, last night I preordered my book to see Damien Echols!  They have a restaurant attached and will soon have a garden store as well.  

I'm now the proud owner of 3 books from the opening night and several photos to remember the nice evening at Changing Hands.  They have all the bookshelves I loved at their Tempe location...like top listed books.  But I especially love their Upcoming Events shelf because my favorite part of Changing Hands is their local events.  And just like at their Tempe location...they sell all the fun quirky gifts and stationary items.  The Phoenix location is nothing short of perfect.

My only gripe was that it was too hot last night and they need to pump up the AC a little bit more...especially with all the windows in the two front walls.

"I have to edit my previous 4 star review down to two stars... it was purchased from the group that owns Mama Ricotta's, Bad Daddy's, Paco's Taco's and Plate Perfect Catering by some guy named Richard Campbell. Since this change in hands, the food quality has dropped off a bit. It's still good, but not as good as it used to be and for the price you pay there, that's not a good thing. The one thing that bothers me most about this place and will probably cause us to seek out a new Mexican restaurant in our area is the fact they have a ""lunch"" menu that's really just a shortened version of their dinner menu with no break in price. There are no ""lunch specials"" like you'd find at any restaurant, but especially a Mexican restaurant. We have one more ""living social"" type coupon we're going to use up there and then we're done.",1.0
I absolutely love this salon! Every time I come I feel welcomed and at home. The decor is very modern and there is lots of cool artwork to look at while you wait. Sonia colored and cut my hair. I'm not picky when it comes to color so I allowed her to do whatever she liked to it which turned out amazing! I also wanted to go from long hair to short hair and she knew exactly what I wanted. She did such an amazing job on my hair and I left so happy! No one else will touch my hair but her and I will definitely continue to go to shampoo ink.,1.0
"Visited Red Thai for the second time last night (on my first visit, I left after sitting at the bar for 15 min and not one of the 5 people behind the bar waited on me - lame). The service was again spotty, one of the bartenders asked the couple next to me 5 times how they were doing and not once asked me but yet loudly yelled ""have a good day"" to me as I was leaving. It was weird. The bartender that waited on me was nice. 

Good happy hour menu. The martini of the day is a terrific value and was pretty tasty. 

The truffle edamame were delish and the pork pot stickers were also delish but the sauce that comes with the pot stickers was amazing! Also had the crispy noodle island - really good!

"If you are looking for a mani\/pedi or a gel mani on the cheap side, you can come here.

The salon itself is OK. Lots of jetted tubs and massage chairs for pedis. Cushy chairs for you while you get your nails done. Other than that, the place is not much to look at. 

I came here because it is close to my home, on the North side of town. Since moving I've been dating around nail shops trying to find my new one. I still long for my salon in the Southwest, but I cannot justify the miles and miles trip there and back just to get my mani\/pedi fix.

They charged me $25 for a take-off of my gels, and a new one-color gel on my nails. First, the tech did take a lot of time to soak, dremel, and scrape my current gels off. And he did pay good attention to my cuticles and nail beds. 

Then the tech did 3 coats and a last coat of clear. Typically I like my gels way thicker than that, but for $25 I am assuming this is what you get. The tech also did not buff my nails afterwards, or tend to my cuticles after putting on the polish. Typically, at other salons, they have done this so there are no nasty little bits left after all is said and done - I did have a few cuticle-trimmings I had to pull out of my nails when I left.

I am saying ""OK"" to this salon, and if you're in a tight spot it's aaalll right. But, there are definitely other salons in Vegas where you can be a bit more pampered, and get a thicker gel for probably $10 - $15 more.

Also - they charge .50 cents for debit card transactions. My nails are aaalll right, but I'll be looking for another salon. Looks like I am just going to have to suck it up and drive a bit further for better quality.",1.0

Coming back?: No

The issue: Friend and I watched appalled as a cockroach crawled around the restaurant floor for a bit, until it made its way under our table. My friend trapped the roach between her empty glass and a menu, and politely called our waiter over. My friend very politely explained the situation to our waiter, and requested that he take care of the bug. He replied with something to the effect of, ""I don't know what you want *me* to do about it. I don't really like bugs either. I've never had a customer do this before."" We proposed multiple solutions, including getting a dustpan or taking the captive roach to the front door and releasing him. He declined both options, opting to have my friend carry the glass, roach, and menu to the door herself, while he graciously held it open for her. She sat down, even more appalled, as the waiter walked away.

After agreeing that the service was unacceptable, my friend addressed the waiter as he brought us our check, mentioning that he should taken care of the bug next time. He took the criticism with a face plastered with offense, and stumbled over his words as he seemed to hold back greater emotions: ""I... I will... Take that note and keep that in the back of my mind."" We payed our bill and left promptly.

Boy do I wish I would've read the reviews before we went. Where do I start?

We were seated in the bar and handed our plastic menus. The prices are outrageous for the lack of quality. I ordered the strip steak and my girlfriend ordered the crab leg dinner. 

My girlfriend has a gluten allergy and she specifically asked for her salad to have no croutons on it. Of course the salad was brought out covered in croutons. She sent it back and instead of making a new one the waiter obviously just picked them off because she found a crouton on the salad. 

My salad had the ""house"" dressing which obviously tasted like it was straight out of a bottle of wishbone because it was awful. 

The bread brought out was stale and not warm.

"Ok. Hate this place, went in to LOOK at the challengers. I was planning on getting one by the end of the year. So I went with my mom dad and my son. I was approached by a sales guy I told him I wanted to check out the challenger. He asked which model , I wasn't sure what the difference was in each he didn't explain anything really. I saw a white one I asked him if we can test drive it all the while telling him I'm NOT BUYING A CAR TODAY. drove it loved it. Told him I wanted to trade in my 05 Ram. I told them to go ahead and test drive it for a trade in offer. I was taken to the showroom to some guy at a desk. He proceeded to tell me I'm lucky they JUST started a sale where you get the most for trade in. I allowed them to pull my credit. Amazingly , I was approved instantly by SEVERAL BANKS including  one that I owed money on. They lie constantly to try to convince you to leave with a vehicle. Some finance guy came out to me asking for my pay stubs. I asked him why would I have them on me ? I was told I'd get 3000 for my truck. It wasn't worth that even. Meanwhile my truck has been gone at least 30 minutes by now. I then told them absolutely not I will not take that , can I please have my keys so I can go. I was told my truck wasn't back yet. I was told I wouldn't get more than 3 for my truck anywhere , that I can be put in a 2014 Dodge Dart immediately. I don't recall ever saying the words Dodge Dart. I wasn't there to get whatever I could , or whatever they thought I should have. They also asked me for my registration to the truck , I've never been asked for that so they can give me an estimate.  I asked for my keys again I was again told it wasn't back. ( almost an hour ). I walked to the other side to see .....my truck parked where I couldn't see it. I was told them the manager had my keys after I confronted them about my vehicle. I had 4 people on me now. Another guy from finance came out asking me to get the dart. I was real annoyed by now. So I will never recommend them I'll never step foot there again. I got my vehicle at chapman last week. I know someone that had to tell towbin she was calling the police if they didn't give her back the keys. There's so many other dealerships that are wonderful.

First and most importantly,  the salon is impeccably clean and hygienic. I've had manis (including gel) and pedis from three different people and they have all delivered consistent high quality. The pedicure chairs are comfortable and I am always offered a beverage (water, tea and even wine!) They have a good selection of polish (both regular and gel) and I always feel like I'm getting what I pay for. If you work in Ballantyne Corporate Park, your BCP card will give you a discount, but even if you don't, they offer 20% off Monday - Wednesday!

Octopus 13.95 (9\/10) -the thinly sliced marinated octopus served over arugula was light and delightful. The portion was sizeable for lunch. The dressing on the salad was just a touch too heavy.

Steak salad 24.00 (9\/10) - This is a dinner menu item but the chef was willing to make it for lunch. A simple dish with three grilled beef tenderloin medallions served over an arugula salad.

Yelp 2014 365 Review Challenge #10",1.0
I purchased a 2013 chevy CERTIFIED VEHICLE in April 2014. This vehicle is a POS (piece of $h1t) I have taken this car 6 times for service issues. I dealt with service rep Mathew. Who by far has the worst customer service. When trying to get a hold of a general manager was only referred to a sales manager. Who said the same crap that my warranty would not cover my issue of the car. This is my first experience with a chevy and last. I have always had a honda. No issues there. I just wanted to support an American made car but in the end was screwed. There is a recall on my car. I will switch back to a honda when I get a chance. PLEASE DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. Please go somewhere else!! If you still want a chevy go another one that will treat u with more respect. Sales team will promise u everything but once u sign u are on your own. I'm still waiting to get my issue resolved. No manager has responded back to help me. Called a different chevy dealership with better service.,1.0

The guy who took my order was friendly and the dude who rang me up was nice but the ordering and paying process was so disorganized that I nearly had a panic attack.  Okay, it wasn't that bad but the place where you ordered was clogged with people waiting for their food so it was tough to tell who was waiting to order and who was waiting for food.  When you walk into a place and see a huge clump of people standing around, it doesn't really welcome you into the place.

"Macarons are a weakness and I think I may have found the place to drive to when those cravings creep up.

In the vicinity of Pin Kaow and Pot Tea, this little storefront whips up one of the best macarons I've had in Vegas. I'll even go as far to say that it's better than Bouchon's. Few flavors comprising of kahlua, vanilla, nutella, mint chocolate, peach, strawberry lemon, lemon, passion fruit, blueberry and you may even catch some other flavors if you come in at the right time. For the most part, you'll usually see about 5-8 flavors on display allowing you to get at least one of each during a visit priced at $1.35 per macaron. I mean, it's almost impossible to eat just one! Why do I like them? Thin, crisp, outer shell with an airy, chewy, moist center and a complementing filling that isn't overpowering. For the times I've come in, there has always been macarons available and all times have been consistent so far.

They also offer a variety of breads, scones, croissants, and dessert pastries. I recommend their ham and cheese croissant and their bread pudding-don't skip out on their bread pudding. You won't regret it.

Employees have been nice. They may not always be peppy but never have they been rude. Witnessed a time where someone didn't have enough cash for some items and wanted to pay the rest on a card without meeting the credit card minimum. She was willing to give the loaf of bread for free.

"We knew we were going to get in late on a Thursday night, so we decided just to book one night here for $21 on Groupon. 

We were actually pleasantly surprised by the casino floor. They had plenty of slots, a late night snack food restaurant and a lounge. It kept us entertained for a few late night hours after we got in, which was awesome since it is located off the strip and we were too lazy to drive anywhere.

The rooms on the other hand were just OK. I think my only complaint would be the shower leaking the entire time we were there. I was so grossed out by the towel inside the shower used to soak up the water that was dripping that I even avoided showering until we checked in to our other hotel. Other than that...the beds were comfy, there was plenty of room and it was quiet.

Overall...if I'm looking for something cheap, I will most definitely consider this hotel.",1.0
"The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. We started off with a nice glass of wine and they brought over some bread for the table. We ordered the Margherita pizza - Mozzarella,  fior di latte, basil and tomato sauce. The crust was very thin and crispy. Even though it is a simple pizza, it was very delicious. We were already half full from the pizza.

Now for the main course. I got the orecchiette with wild boar, sausage. My friend got the ravioli. They were both very very good. The pasta was fresh and chewy. The meats was very flavourful. I clean the plate very quickly. We both liked our pasta dishes a lot. Very satisfied tummies.",1.0
"The ice cream tasted good. I did notice that my husband's ice cream that was supposed to be 1 scoop of 1 flavor was actually 4 scoops. My ice cream that was supposed to be 2 scoops of 2 flavors was actually 3 scoops total--less ice cream than what my husband's ice cream was, although his ice cream cost half the price of mine. I suggest that this business standardize how many scoops that they give to people. 
Aside from the ice cream, we also played a round of mini golf. The course was maintained well. 
Kerber's also has a convenience store, deli, playground, all-season tubing, and a petting zoo, which I somehow did not see.",1.0

Beef Wellington (for 2) 
- you get 2 individual plates, it's just a larger beef wellington cut in half.  The filet mignon was soooo tender and the puff pastry and duxelle was amazing.

As for food, that was plenty.  I'm the type of person who almost always get the buffet passes at vegas cuz it's actually worth it for me.  I was stuffed at the end of this meal - no desserts.   

The service is top-notch.  My date left her lapkin (i call it a lapkin cuz it's on your lap) messy on the table when she went to go to the restroom and the guy freakin comes and folds it up nicely and puts it back.

"I took the cab 170 from the hotel in Vegas to a business meeting in Henderson NV. I had my GPS going as well as the driver had it on his ""smart phone"". I was distracted on the phone with the bank so don't know either the driver missed the right turn or the ""GPS took us a longer route"" but we were now going not the most direct route. I showed him immediately on my phone that we were taking the EXTENDED ROUTE that a wrong turn had been taken & was adding an addition mile onto the trip. The young driver of cab 170 refused to credit me the unnecessary additional mileage & this made my bill higher due to either driver error or GPS error either way I didn't appreciate the lack of customer service. I still tipped 20% because I could & because another's wrong doesn't make it wrong\/right for me & honestly he probably really needed the $.

FOOD: No grocery or meat here,  just a few refrigerator cases and deep freezers. Some noodles, soups, and a lot of fish here (sashimi quality, frozen and unsalted), but my favorite find is the black sesame mochi. Tiny section of ready-made buns and sushi rolls, limited variety but would love to find out when they put the dishes out fresh.

GIFTS: Quite a few small gift items, from decorative magnet and eraser sets to some Hello Kitty merchandise and the Asian equivalent of bizarre ""as seen on TV"" products. Good items to grab to mail to a friend or tuck into a birthday or holiday gift bag.

DRY GOODS\/COSMETICS\/OTHER: noodles and seasonings, dishes and chopsticks, and tons of foreign hair dyes and magazines, mostly geared toward visitors and recent immigrants who have a particular brand favorite from back home. 

There's also a movie rental area, which is unique and cool, though I wasn't clear on how it works. Small wine selection toward the back. Friendly staff. 

$10 card minimum lost them a star: I'm not surprised by it but dislike that the info isn't posted anywhere. Inconvenient when all I grab are small, cheap items. Pricing is all over the place: absurdly high on some items, average or normal on others, and suspiciously cheap on a handful, too.",1.0
"Came here on a Saturday night at about 10pm, they weren't really busy but we my boyfriend and I did pay 10 dollars per person, per game. We used to frequently go to the AMF in North Phoenix was significantly cheaper (maybe because we were apart of the late night crowd?) 
If it weren't for the price...I would give them 5 stars. 
They're located just off of Thomas and Scottsdale Rd, so it's not too far if you're coming from Old Town. 
It's the closest bowling alley that I've seen to have a night club environment. They play top 40, have music videos playing over every other lane and glow in the dark bowling pins.

"If you've ever been in need of furniture in a larger city, chances are you've heard of Ashley. It's a large chain of low\/mid-range furniture for all your home decor needs. It has a very typical home furnishing story layout, which is to say, kind of confusing. They try to set it up by making mini rooms throughout the store and you end up having to wander the entire massive complex in order to see everything of one type. For example, if you are looking for a bed, you'll have to traverse the entire cosmos in order to see the offerings. I'm sure the idea behind this is that they are trying to get you to buy more than one thing but it ends up translating to wasting a lot of time.

Ashley's furniture offerings aren't especially high quality but they do look nice. They are the type of pieces that will look good while they last but you should expect to replace them in a few short years. For most people this is fine. A lot of us can't afford to drop the cash required to get high end furniture. Their ""leather"" offerings are especially low quality (don't trust me on this, go touch and smell it and then do the same thing at Arhaus or Restoration Hardware).

The salesmen are a bit pushy so I'm assuming they work on commission. If you tell them that you aren't buying and are just looking then you'll probably never see them again. I find this type of salesmanship very obnoxious and shortsighted. 

I suppose Ashley is the right kind of store for a lot of people. I have purchased a few things from them in the past... but I'll admit that I always did it with a lump in my throat. In the end, you get what you pay for.",1.0
"This burger place is definitively a hidden gem. 
Great service and friendly staff. 

Their number one seller (according to their employee) 'Apple Butter Burger' has made to top of my favourite burger list. It is one of the best burger I've ever had. The patty is cooked to perfection, it's juicy and thick,  the apple butter sauce goes well with everything, and the big buns soaks up all the sauces and extra juices so no messiness.

The 'Masala Burger' is not as heavy as ABB in terms of sauces, and has a curry taste to it. It's a bit spicy, and you also have an option of adding extra spicy sauce. 

The 'Salisbury Burger' is another one of my favorites! Lots of gravy and meaty! Yum!

The poutine was also great but I'm gonna stick to regular fries next time as it was a bit too heavy for me and their regular fries are pretty amazing!",1.0
"I'll give SLICE a nod, it definitely crosses a unique bridge between traditional South Hills style pizza and artisan pies.  After wanting to try it for a few years now, we finally made a random impulse stop on our way home on the the T.

Having remembered positive praise about the ""Fancy Pants"" pizza, we decided to give one of those a whirl.  As others commented, super thin, crisp and chewy crust (note, don't reheat these pies in the oven or you'll be greeted with a brick), but definitely no where close to my favorite dough.

The toppings seem to be where SLICE shines.  Inventive mix-ups, quality ingredients and portion control (yes...  I said it, not every pie needs to have 10 lbs of cheese and sauce on it) create an overall enjoyable bite.

I don't know what it was, but our party just wasn't digging it.  Even as I look back, I can't tell if I liked the pizza or if I was just hungry.  Given SLICE delivers, well likely give that a try next time we're in a bind for food, but I definitely don't think I'd actively seek it out with so many other great pie joints in the South.",1.0

I have noticed a trend, of which HealthCarePartners is participating, in which these facilities tag extra services onto doctor visits which are typically not covered or covered only partially.

"My experience with Xtend Barre Charlotte started with a nervous phone call.  I called to inquire about new customer pricing and concerns I had regarding my ability to complete class.  I'm a former ballet dancer of 15 years, and sustained a hip injury in a car accident in October.  I was seeking a fun, challenging workout to try as my first since my accident and since Xtend Barre includes aspects of dance, I thought it would  be something I'd be more comfortable with I figured I'd give it a shot.  Rodney answered the phone and gave me all the information I needed.  He was VERY sweet and listened to my whole story before assuring me I'd have no trouble in class and that the moves could be modified if necessary.  I signed up for a class the next day via their website feeling confident after speaking with him.  I arrived at the studio (which is beautiful) to find Rodney and the instructor of my class, Caitlin, at the desk.  Rodney had already told Caitlin and his wife and co-owner Shawna about my situation and all three made me feel right at home.  The class was a challenge, Shawna turned around from teaching a class to taking the class I was in and offered modifications for any moves that were uncomfortable on my hip, and I felt fantastic afterward.  Caitlin was super sweet and offered great suggestions as well.  It was a good combination of cardio and strength exercises.  I've been to one other class so far and I can't wait to purchase my unlimited membership this week.  This team of motivating, caring people make exercising a comfortable and positive experience even for someone like me who has been out of it for 8 months.

"I have been going to this nail salon for the better part of the last 8-9 years, and for the price, I wouldn't go anywhere else! Yes, the prices are more than what you'd pay at Phoenix salons, but when is anything cheaper in Scottsdale than in Phoenix? No matter who you see there, the premises is always clean and well-maintained. I'm notorious for booking last minute appointments, and I usually never have too much of a problem to get an appointment with Tracie (or is it Tracey? Not sure of the spelling!). 

On that note, Tracie is absolutely great. In the 8-9 yrs I've gone there, she's my 3rd regular nail tech since once I find someone I like, I rarely let anyone else touch my nails. Whether I've done just plain gel manicures, pink and white, normal acrylic, whatever, Tracey does a great job at giving me a nice looking set of hands. I mostly have acrylics on, and I like them to be filed and cut at a length that looks natural (you know, natural enough for being fake), and Tracie consistently does that for me. In the rare occasions I've gone somewhere else to have my nails done, I tell them I don't want my nails too thick, and they either still make them thick or fat looking, or they do it thin and then my nails end up chipping in a week. They've never chipped in my entire time of going to Allure Nails! Their staff just ""gets it"" and is used to accommodating the needy Scottsdale crowd. I've received numerous compliments through the years on my nails regardless of who my nail tech at the time was at Allure Nails. 

Pedicures are great but hit or miss depending on the person. I only go to Tracie for pedicures as well, but I've had my share of people do my pedicures here and some are more thorough than others. My advice is to give a few different people a try until you find the best person who works for what you like!

Overall I would say it was okay, but I was not Wow'd or even inspired to come back ""real soon"".
Growing up eating Mexican food,  and living more than half my life in the Southwest, I prefer a little more character in the food.  
The Mexican Fried Rice had the most character because it's green.  I asked the waitress and was told Poblano and Cilantro, but I couldn't really tell. The rice was overcooked, but the flavor was alright.  The beans I would rate the lowest because they tasted like they were canned that were enhanced with just the sprinkle of cheese that's melted on top.
We we pleasantly surprised by a dessert ""on the house"" that was simple and satisfying. A tiny flour tortilla filled with apple pie filling and a touch of cream\/cheese, grilled like a quesadilla and then tossed in cinnamon sugar.  Mmm.
I missed the fact they had a full bar.  Lots of temptation there.  Guess I may need to check out their happy hour deals.
One last thing.  Our server was pleasant but so quiet and wasn't familiar with the specials.  She left without dropping the bill or telling us she was leaving -- so we waited for our check.  It was then I learned they had a full bar cuz I figured I needed to go to a register to pay.
Gimme a server that is confident, brings some of that personality to her service and makes you glad you stopped in regardless of the food.",1.0

"We decided to try it after reading all these reviews. I'm gonna say I've had WAYYYY better at Nonna's Oven in Elgin Mills and Woodbine for about the same price (if you consider all the toppings they add). 

We tried the baked AND the fried Panzos to see if we liked either, and the fried Panzo was disgusting!!!!! Deep fried pizza dough just does not taste good and gets soggy really quickly. The baked one was what I expected and was decent but nothing to write home about. 

I'm not sure what people are saying about the BEST panzo's... I definitely would NOT agree. Sorry guys!",1.0
"Awesome massage! My wife and I recently visited here after seeing the Yelp special. There are a lot Reflexology places throughout town and we have tried a lot. Some have been good and some of been a little disappointing. SVIP spa was amazing! They have a very peaceful and well decorated decor as well as very comfortable massage tables. Dana was my masseuse and she was great. For me, I'm on my feet a lot for work or for the gym and after leaving here, I felt like I had a brand new pair. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.",1.0
"Came here on a Saturday afternoon while browsing around Coventry, and was definitely glad I checked this place out! 

The atmosphere is modern, industrial, minimalistic, and clean. The place was packed with people studying and people going in and out after getting their coffees. The barista was very nice and friendly, and service was prompt, which is always a plus. I ordered a cappuccino, and it was one of the best I've had. Rich, bold, & foamy from freshly-roasted coffee beans-- definitely some good cappuccino here. Not to mention the extra bonus of supporting local businesses! 

My only complaint is the limited seating, especially apparent on weekend afternoons. I waited around after getting my coffee for a seat so I could get some studying done, but didn't have much luck. Seems like you've really got to stake your place out earlier in the day if you want a seat.

"We wanted to try the chausson a la compote de pommes and the fougasse aux olives kalamata, because of their good reviews. The apple tart, $2, stood the test of time (was not too sweet and still enjoyable by the end of the day), and the olive bread, $3.50, though it very well may have been excellent at its freshest, got hard and drenched its paper bag in oil by the end of the day. Well, at least it's olive oil! It's my fault though. Sigh, the pressures of getting all the foods you want to try when on vacation, and realizing you don't have a big enough stomach to enjoy them. I'd come back for some more viennoiserie next time I'm in town. These prices are so much cheaper than in NY.",1.0

"I come here from time to time for lunch with my boyfriend. Previously reviewed by Bryan M. The burgers are okay. Not a huge fan of burgers in general. The chocolate cherry shake is amazing if it's made thick and right.(not with whole cherries.. It's dangerous). I would like to try the sweet potato fries but haven't yet. Onion rings are very good. I really wish they had iceberg lettuce that's not shredded... Absolutely hate shredded lettuce. And it makes the burger fall apart. It's alittle pricey, not price friendly to go here on a regular basis. But everyone should at least try this place. Recommended.

"Let me tell you: I was very excited that there was a place solely dedicated to meatballs. Although I have limited exposure to homemade meatballs, I really enjoyed the meatballs from Emporio (Sienna Mercato). Their concept for their meatballs is equivalent to Subway. What I mean by this is that you get to choice every single step of your entree. You start off by choosing the type of meat, then the sauce, what type of vehicle you want your meatball to be in, and optional sides. I ordered the classic beef with marinara sauce as a meatball slider and got the tomato risotto as a side. The meatball itself was very large and I was full after the slider. My one complaint would be the tomato risotto. Unlike other risottos I have tried, I could tell that the rice had been par-cooked and then added to the sauce which is not how a traditional risotto is made. As a tip of the restaurant, I would not advertise ""tomato risotto"" if it is not cooked in the risotto technique. Other than that, I would definitely go back and try the many combinations!",1.0

"DO NOT LET THEM TOUCH YOUR HAIR!!!!  I went in to have my hair cut as well as coloured ombre fashion.  I ended up with my hair half platinum blonde half dark brown without any transition between the colours.  The hair dresser,Tanya, was in a hurry I could tell because she did a half ass job on my hair.  She only did the bottom half of my hair, she over processed my hair because while waiting for my hair to bleach she began threading another customer's face.  She didn't even cut my hair properly because I went to a different salon and they said she cut my hair wrong, she was unaware of how to do a major trend in ombre which is balayage.  This cost me 200 dollars, when I asked for a refund they denied me and were only willing to offer to fix my hair which I wouldn't have done.  If you want to get your hair done go to a Yorkville salon like Hair on the Avenue you'll be much more pleased with the result.",1.0
"Walked in and they were too busy to see me at the Genius Bar.  OK, fine, but they also wouldn't make me an appointment, said I had to do it at home on the internet.  Whatever.  Then I came in three days later and the woman helping me couldn't been less interested, ruder, or more condescending.  It was an iPhone screen issue, and she told me they could replace it for $149 but that it probably wouldn't work and I'd have to buy a new phone anyway.  Obviously all she cared about was doing the least amount of work possible and making me buy more of their crap.  Took the phone to an iPhone repair place and they fixed it for $90 in 25 minutes, no problem.",1.0
"Only groups for trivia night. Unless you're okay with meeting random people at the bar, then by all means stay.

Also go on live music night...it's free, the music isn't the greatest, but when it's free it's at the very least a good laugh when you've got friends to chill with, watch the game - Pirates for me is always the go to.

"I'm pretty easy to impress - I love to give good reviews! This place though, kind of a let down. The cupcake was OK, probably 3 stars... But the order and payment process was a joke. The cupcakes are right there, hand me one and take my 4 dollars!!! Rather than this simple concept which most bakeries, coffee shops, and every other type of retailer have mastered... you order, they write it down (meanwhile the cupcake is still right there).. They take the order in the back (not sure what happens there), then return, grab the cupcake (still one foot from where you are standing), and place it on the back counter. At that point you wait about 3-5 minutes while the 1 cashier catches up, grabs the cupcake, and finally takes your payment. It wasn't just us... Everyone in the store was just standing around asking what was going on... Very strange. And sorry, for $4 the cupcake should be amazing. It just wasn't.",1.0

The receptionist told me to choose ONE condition to bring up to the doctor. She said it is the clinic's policy that a patient present with only one condition. I was appalled! I was welcome to return after 24 hours for another ONE. Since I have been on a waiting list for 18 months for a doctor, I did not have a family doctor to see about the other two issues. So, I found a private clinic on the West Island and paid $85 to have all 3 conditions looked in to. 
Lesson learned. Only get sick with ONE issue if you want to be seen at the Brunswick Medical Centre. 
I do like the appointment policy however. Arrive in the morning, book a time for later on and return in time for a much shorter wait to see a doctor....about ONE condition only!",1.0

I think this is the only bar I've ever given a 5 star review to, and The Chandelier continues to live up to what I wrote in my original review! The 2nd level bar remains my favorite and coming here for pre-dinner drinks or before late night seems to be the way to go if you prefer to avoid the crowd. The elaborate decor (crystals, pinks & purples) represents The Cosmopolitan well.

The Blue Grass Shuffle is a bit of a stiff drink for someone that is prone to develop ""Asian glow"" but is my drink of choice nonetheless.  If you want something stiffer in Vegas you'll probably have to hit up a male gigolo. But I don't think they include egg whites like the Shuffle does, well who knows, if you tip them extra maybe they'll make you breakfast.

"Some of my work friends and I ordered takeout from the lunch menu. Because it was restaurant week, we just decided to order the restaurant week menu: soup, salad, and 1\/2 a sandwich. It was nice of them to accomodate us with our takeout request, so that was much appreciated.

I had 1\/2 of a turkey club (with real applewood smoked bacon and real, oven roasted turkey on toasty bread), a small garden salad, and the soup of the day, which happened to be cream of mushroom. The salad was on the small side, as in there were only about five pieces of lettuce and two small grape tomatoes, but the dressing was nice and light, and for lunch, this was plenty of food.

The sandwich was delicious, even without the mayo. Win! The bread was fresh and lightly toasted, and the sandwich was large for being just 1\/2 of a sandwich. My favorite item was the mushroom soup. Super creamy, yet there was enough tang from the mushrooms to cut through the cream. Really delicious. 

Needless to say, I just had a small sampling of the lunch menu, so I look forward to reviewing the dinner menu soon!",1.0

I was very happy and appreciative that they offered a vegetarian burger option, as well as a shrimp and grits sans shrimp. We ended up sitting outside on one of the patio tables, which was perfect because the weather was incredible and it was much less crowded than inside. Further, we schmoozed with the chefs to make sure we could get the first samples before they headed inside. I would say that being inside seemed a bit overcrowded, but who can say no to attending such wonderful events? Thanks again to Rachel for another fun event.",1.0
"Not what we expected and not worth the money.  There is better BBQ for less money in Phoenix.  We tried Bootlegger's because we like to try new restaurants and this is near our home.  We sat at a high top and the tables and chairs were cool, but the table very wobbly.  This would not have been a big deal but you have to CUT their 16 hour brisket and 14 hour pulled pork.  Why do you have to cut pulled pork?  the whole table shook and drinks were spilled while cutting meat that should not need to be cut.

"The pizza is good and slightly better than Barro's, but be warned you will pay a decent amount of coin to get that slightly better than Barro's pizza. Went there today and realized two things (1) the pizza is awesome (2) the pizza is expensive.

I ordered two large two topping pizzas and the total was $42. Compare that to Barro's where you can get the same thing for $19. Maybe it's me but I can't taste the $23 difference. 

With that being said, the food here is outstanding and it has a nice New York charm to it. The pizza is pretty authentic in comparison to that in New York. If you are willing to pay for it, then I would suggest this spot.

"First time here, in fact first doctor to see here in Arizona since I just moved here from Chicago. There was definitely a lot of paperwork that had to be filled out, so make sure you come early because I'm normally fast with filling them out and this took me 15-20 min. The waiting room is decent especially the chairs. I came an hour early because I didn't want to be late in an unfamiliar area. I waited 30min and was asked to come in the back. It took doctor 5 min to come into the room if that. Dr. Chaung is one of a kind. Very funny and completely realistic and understanding when it comes to patients. I came with a strep throat and he told me he was 99.9% sure it was strep, so doing the strep tests wasn't necessary especially that it would cost more to do this test when it wasn't necessary. Perfect for me I don't want to spend extra money if I didn't have to. He is on the patients side when it comes to money. He doesn't want the patient to spend more then they have to and that is the best part about this doctor. He's very energetic and expresses himself very well. I would even say he is enthusiastic. He did a great job explaining everything to me, check everything and made sure I didn't have any other questions before he left. Best part he has good bedside manners and shook my hand. Believe it or not when doctors shake the patients hands it really means a lot and it shows respect. Even though it was a 40min drive it was totally worth it. I knew I need antibiotics and I wanted to get them and leave I didn't want to spend much time in there. It was perfect. Thanks so much! Wish there were more doctors like him.",1.0

"Pourquoi allé dans se resto quand il y a d'autre option au centre-ville ?
Se resto fait parti d'une chaîne de franchise qui se spécialise dans

I was hesitant to ask for a pick up when i made reservation over phone. But the Enterprise guy himself offered Pick up and made it easy for it. Thanks to u Brother!!!

-They are very Liberal in transferring reservations to other locations or cancellations\/modifications to the reservations. When you are at a new place on a trip\/vacation there are always high chances of changes to your plan.

Josh and staff are professional and caring for their customers. They took the time to listen and take care of the needs of my car. That's speaks volume to me. That is how my loyalty is earned and I didn't have to try. They have a willingness to help and make sure that you leave their shop safe and sound. Thank you Mini Tempe staff!!!,1.0
"My friend went here for the 1st time, and will be the last.  I walked in asking for a mani pedi... and not one person looked at me or greeted me until I had been standing up front for 10 mins or more, then they told me 20min. So I waited, my friend showed up 10mins and we still waited another 15-20 mins.  As for the nails. they convinced me to upgrade and it says in description that you get 10 min massage, I got zero minutes. Very disappointed.  My friend was almost done by the time someone started doing anything for me.  We spend 3hours in this place.  My girlfriends gels nails were sloppy and the worker said come back tomorrow...what?...who has time!?! The best part is leaving and going to sushi. Sorry. I will not go here again.",1.0
"As I am writing this review I'm am attending a convention here.  First off, you cannot walk the block from your hotel to the convention center without being harassed for money by all the transients.  Hey city of Phoenix, clean up you're town!  The convention center food court sucks.  The hours suck.  The staff sucks.  The amenities here suck.  The chairs here suck.  The tables suck.  The streets are dirty and there is little to do.",1.0
"My brother went to another location and was absolutely in love with it.  He wanted to take me, so we came to the Chandler location.  While he seemed pleased with his food, I was rather disappointed.
First, it wasn't hot.  At best, mildly warm, which was pathetic because it was ready pretty quickly.  Second, I ordered the egg foo yung vegitarian, but what i received was a sloppy burnt mess loaded with pork (and there's another problem, it was burnt yet not hot).  And lastly, my chile relleno quesadilla was overrun with greasy cheese, almost unbearable.  
My first trip here wasn't good, but there are other locations, and this is not that spot that my brother raved about.  There are other items on the menu that i'd like to try, so I might just give it another shot.",1.0

"Convenient if you stay at the Tuscany Hotel, otherwise, you can find so much better. We had dinner there, then breakfast. Dinner : we ordered pizzas, and i'm pretty sure mine was bought at Walmart and defrosted. Breakfast : not very good, and I suspect it made me sick.",1.0
"Ever since the son took over, you would have expected more of a modern touch. Yes they added salads which is great, but you need to ask for all dressed or else all you get is ICEBERG LETTUCE, DRESSING (mayo, oil, vinegar) and THE MEAT. All-dressed includes: cheese, eggplant, carmelized onion and hot peppers. Sorry for for 10$ a salad, it should be standard. 

The coffees are good obviously BUT can they have any other milk than 3.25%. Not asking for Almond or Soy but atleast 1%...something else. 

You can either get the guy that's screaming your name for dear life outside holding your coffee waiting for you to flag him down or the nicer ones.

"Not a trustworthy staff... I left a brand new jacket hanging in the closet of my room. From the time I checked out to the time I contacted the hotel (less than 24 hours), it was gone. No one checked back into the room so the only people that had access to enter were the housekeepers. I spoke to the general manager and he didn't have anything to offer other than suggesting I double check my bags. Next year, our softball team will not be returning to this hotel.",1.0
"Esther is by far the most knowledgeable person I know in terms of cat and dog nutrition. She goes above and beyond for her clients, providing ONLY the bes tin pet nutrition.

I do all my pet shopping here, and constantly refer people to her.

Also, her compassion for animals can't be overstated. For years Esther and Kennel Cafe have held adopt-a-thons in co-operation with Toronto Animal Services to get deserving pets to good homes. Not to mention she would always have cats at the store ready for adoption!

"Over the years, I've seen numerous chiropractors.  I was a recent visitor to Dr. Daney's office and continue to visit regularly for ""maintenance"" purposes.  The difference with Dr. Daney is her thorough attention to detail each and every visit.  It's not your typical run of the mill chiropractors that just adjusts you and moves on.  She takes the time to relieve tension in my muscles and is experienced in various treatment methods.  She has even performed acupuncture on my foot for other issues.

"My friends have eaten here for dinner and enjoyed it. So, we decided to come for brunch. Bad decision. After placing our orders, we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. When it did, it was cold. Eggs congealed, shrimp & grits a solid mass. 

While enduring our wait, I Had 2 ""special"" bloody mary's with chili and with bacon-infused vodkas. Marginal; nothing special. We were far from the only table experiencing problems: during our wait, we saw the manager putting out fire after fire. One table apparently reporting long wait & cool food too (we found out they were right); at another table, 2 young ladies had a mimosa poured on top of them. 

It should be noted that the manager did step up. He took care of our bill (drinks only; we did not eat the cold food but left still hungry & went elsewhere to eat) and offered to take care of our bill the next time. However, we live out of state, and while my friends come to Las Vegas annually, who knows when or if I might be back? The point is, the manager should not have had to ""make it right."" Very disappointing.",1.0

They even had a special VIP room with majorly expensive toys that were very rare.

"I phoned eight different jewelry stores around Las Vegas for pricing on some work I needed done.  Anthony's was lower than all the other quotes received.

Definately would  recommend them.",1.0
"Glad that I didn't trust the off reviews I've read on here and tried the Arrowhead location for myself. After walking out of a local sports bar that was not on their game, we decided to try Zipps in Glendale. 
I must say, I was surprised! I had a great time Friday night.The place was packed. And Wow... some really cute guys in here. ;) 
Everyone was either watching a game, hanging with friends, laughing and\/or just having a great time! Definitely not the same atmosphere from other sports bars within the area. 
Anyways, I ordered a Coors Light, Wings, fries & Salad. My food was excellent! The Wings were super crispy and super tasty. The golden wing sauce was really yummy. My beer was ice cold. Our server was extremely friendly and totally on top of things...she had no name tag, so I can't give her a thumbs up on here because I don't remember her name. But, I must say, the customer service at this location is really great! We saw our server at least 10 times and the manager must have stopped at our table to talk to us like 3 times. Definitely makes your experience pretty amazing when you have a fun atmosphere, great service and super yummy food! Zipps, you sure nailed it last night. Trifecta! :)",1.0
"Entered the chandler mall through this place and they have the coffee shop right next to the entrance. It's a Starbucks which is a plus. It seems like most people walk through this place on their way to the mall which is annoying if you're shopping for books. There were notably people working the coffee shop which made for really long lines and a long wait for a cup of coffee. I was there on a Sunday afternoon so I'm not sure if that plays a part. I can't say I think of this place when I'm thinking about buying a new book. It will always represent an entrance to the mall for me.  If you know what you're looking for and want grab it on your way to visit other stores this place is great. If you want to get lost in a book section it may not be the place. The ""read a book while sipping on a cup of Joe"" vibe is definitely not there. The ""let's force people to walk through the bookstore before coming into the mall"" vibe definitely is.",1.0

"Real slick Brittany! 

Brought my iPhone 5s in for their buyback program. ($300). Was told by sales rep. Brittany, only half of it can be applied to my bill and other half must be for acessories that can only be used right there right now. I thought it was a little fishy, but she said it with such confidence. Even said it'll be like that also if I did it online. Online said nothing about half must be for ascessories.

"I cannot review The Palm based on the food as food was not on my radar today. I was at The Palm for a painting event from Vegas Painting Parties. Having looked at the menu online as well as reviews on Yelp I knew this place would be outside of my price range for food. I ate lunch before I came and I am happy I did. While I did not order food I did order some drinks. One iced tea and one Irish Coffee. When my check came I was shocked to see the iced tea was $4.25 and the coffee was another $12+. With tip I ended up paying $20 for two drinks. Oh my word! That being said, the tea, while small, was a good fresh tasting iced tea. The Irish Coffee, also small, had enough alcohol to feel the burn. And the whipped cream, real whipped cream, what incredibly rich and very thick. Almost too thick to be whipped cream. It was almost as whipped butter. Delicious. I wish the coffee was a tad hotter but other than that, not bad. The service was good too. There were a lot of us in attendance this afternoon and the restaurant seemed to be busy. Still, three or four servers kept our needs in mind and tended to us frequently and almost without being seen. I didn't even see my check arrive.  Aside from the service and the drinks that I did get to experience, the food I saw and could smell seemed great. I was getting hungry. Maybe for a very, emphasize VERY special occassion, I'll try the food too.",1.0
"DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!!! They are the most unprofessional group of individuals I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. It is impossible to get through to anyone there!! Towards the end of my lease I opted to find a different living situation, so I did what you're supposed to do, which was give a 30 day notice a month before my lease was set to expire.  The last day of my lease would have been on the 5th of the following month, so I requested a prorated rent amount, considering the fact that I would only be there for 5 days. They told me that the woman I needed to speak with was in a meeting and instructed me to send my request via email, and they would get back to me. A week later, no call... Instead, they posted a charge to my online account for the full rent plus a month to month fee! I called to speak to one of the property managers regarding the issue and again, she was ""in a meeting"" and would call me back. Finally, after a huge run-around, they emailed me a prorated amount. NOTE: I never received a return phone call. Now the most recent issue I'm having is they've scammed me out of my deposit!! I requested a detailed invoice for the exact charges and they never sent them!! I've called on multiple occasions and every time I call they tell me that the individual I need to speak with is in a meeting and that he will call me back... He has yet to return a single phone call!!! THIS IS WHAT THEY DO!! They tell you ""they are currently in a meeting, they will call you back"". I honestly do not understand how they are still in business!! I honestly believe that all of the good review they have were submitted by the employees who work there.  I believe that only the bad reviews were written by actual clients because they are a reflection of my personal experience with this horrendous company. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT use this company. Additionally, I would advise everyone to tell anyone they know that this company is a scam and to avoid it at all costs!!! Do not give them the opportunity to scam you out of your money!!",1.0

My massage was great and very relaxing.  The 50 minutes went by so fast but it was still great.  Afterwards, I took advantage of the jacuzzi, steam room and pool.

"Great food and variety of plates\/flavors! I like sampling a lot of dishes to share family-style, so I really enjoy this style of dining.

Risotto of the day (mushroom & spinach):
I think this was my first time having risotto, so I'm not sure how this compares to the standard. However, I really enjoyed this dish. The rice was creamy and soft, but not in a mushy way. There was fresh spinach, which added a slightly crunchy texture to the creamy risotto. There were also nice mushroom pieces. The salt and fresh cracked pepper on top added a dash of spice. 

Pancetta wrapped gnocchi:
SO GOOD! Our server told us that this is a customer favorite, and I can see why. The pancetta was salty and savory, while the gnocchi was soft and light. The cheese sauce was absolutely delicious, and this is coming from someone who doesn't really eat\/like cheese. There were 3 skewers, each with 3 pancetta wrapped gnocchi. Each skewer also had a triangle of focaccia bread, which was grilled to perfection and wonderful for mopping up that extra cheese sauce! I'm already dreaming about ordering another plate of this on my next visit.

Papas bravas:
Delicious! I love potatoes, and these were cooked well -- crispy and crunchy on the outside, while soft and tender on the inside. There was a spicy kick to these potatoes as well, as the potatoes seemed to have been seasoned with some kind of dry rub, not a wet sauce. I would definitely order this again!

Lamb lollipops:
Our waiter told us this lamb is from New Zealand! The meat was tender and juicy, but I didn't particularly enjoy the cheese that was on it. While the lamb was well-cooked, I probably wouldn't order this again just because I didn't like the seasoning.

Meatball Marsala:
Eh, this was one dish I didn't particularly enjoy. The meatballs themselves were fine. I just didn't enjoy the gravy sauce, which was somewhat reminiscent of school cafeteria food for me. 

Vegan palette cleanser:
I highly recommend that you order this right away to cleanse your palette throughout the course of your meal. I initially thought these were unnecessary, so I glossed over them. However, my SO ordered it, and I realized how well these do cleanse your palette. I love trying a variety of dishes, so having this really helps me truly experience each dish for how it is supposed to taste, unbiased from earlier dishes, especially transitioning from drastically different plates. This consists of 8 blackberries wrapped in spinach leaves with white truffle oil and black pepper, which is a good amount.

Israeli couscous salad:
I didn't really like this for one reason: the greasy feeling. While this was very refreshing with very clean flavors, the couscous felt so oily, and it left a greasy feeling in my mouth. I preferred the risotto over this.

Service:
We had 2 waiters (not sure why) but both were friendly and gave a brief description of each dish as it arrived. They checked up on us frequently and asked to make sure everything was going smoothly.",1.0
"I'm pretty new to gyms, I started going a few days before Christmas. Each Gym seems to have its own enrollment and cancellation fees. The difference between Gold's and other Gyms is that Gold's pretends that it doesn't have these things. Gold's thinks you're just too stupid to read their fine print. 

I went in for a one week trial with a friend. I had been working out at home and with another friend at a different gym as a guest for about a month. Gold's was closer to home which was nice. My first few times there were great. Then came the last two days of my two week trial. What they told me about this ""$1 enrollment fee"" was bull. Apparently, It was $1 to enroll...and then they charged you the other $98 later. So since that was a no-go, let's do some math. 

It'd be $220 a year to do their ""Basic"" package. Which is $100 up front but then ""month-to-month"" (you basically pay for ten months up-front. But they still charge you that fee. K.)
It'd be $180 for the full year at $15\/month. I don't remember if there was an enrollment fee for this or not. 
And then the premium package would be $250. With $20\/m and $10 starting fee. Why is the most expensive option only $30 more than the least expensive option. What kind of bass awkwards ish is that? 

Oh, but that last option is ""month-to-month""! No. No, it isn't. The salesmen will tell you it is. Then as you're reading the paperwork it says ""cancellation fee if canceled within the first six months of service"". Uhm. Isn't the point of month to month to have the freedom to quit WHENEVER THE HELL I PLEASE? Not ""whenever you choose so long as it's after we've got atleast $110 out of you.""

Atleast let me do my jaw stretches before you try to shove it in my mouth again, Gold's. Geez.  I don't recommend going here at all. The staff was non-commital unless you wanted to spend money on their facility. Which seemed on the lower side of average from what I've seen from gyms anyway.",1.0

"I own a florist in the Washington DC area and I had a customer who needed to send flowers to Gilbert AZ. I showed a few other florists in the area  a picture of the arrangement that my customer wanted and none of them even with higher yelp reviews had the flowers to make the arrangement.  Needless to say, this wasnt the first place I called, but I glad I called them because the customer service all the way to the final product was outstanding.

The arrangement was pretty simple. White Hydrangeas, Peonies, Calla lillies and roses.

The owner was able to create the design the same day and match the picture the same day. They had to make a special order but it was still well ahead of the time frame.

I spent sometime speaking with the owner and believe me she is extremely accommodating and personable. 

I would beyond a doubt recommend her services as they are highly professional.


*** Tip when reading other reviews about this place.

I have been in the florist industry for more then 30 years. From my experience it is always best to call ahead when making a delivery to a home or even a business. People are constantly in and out of there houses and offices and if we dont do this then there is a chance that your gift can be left un attended.  Then bad weather can take effect, or perhaps they have a big house and dont regularly check packages at the front door. Or they might have a front door that is not visable from the driveway so if they get home they dont even see the flowers. 

I always tell my customers if you really want to surpise the recipient then make sure you include that in the special instructions while placing the order online or mentioning it to the person you are placing the order to.


Hope this helps.",1.0

"I was recommended to see Cindy, a Jr. stylist at W salon and I was very please with the service that I got.  I love it when hair stylists make recommendations based on their true opinion and are knowledgeable about what the latest trends are.  I'm quite a simple girl when it comes to hair, I wanted a trim and Cindy suggested keeping the hair a bit longer.  She suggested a style that would best suit my face shape.  What I really appreciated was that she was honest when she told me that my bangs did not suit me and that it would be best to grow them out.  She was very tactful in the way she told me this too.

She took her time with my hair and offered me tea during the service.  I told Cindy that I was doing a fun photo shoot in the evening and she asked me what I liked but also suggested how she could do my hair.  I said that the style needed to last until evening and that I was tired and would probably nap before going to the shoot.  She assured me that the style would last and sure enough, it did!  My hair looked amazing in the photos, so perfectly curled and shiny!  I even took a nap on my hair before the shoot.",1.0
"It amazes me the upgrades they've made since moving to the area. A few things I've noticed:

- flashier produce section (labeled and presentation upgrades)

- a push for more organic and clean eating products available (they brought the fruit cutting and packing from the back to the front so you can watch the employees picking fruit... Oh and they make their own juices including pineapple, carrot and orange juices)

-a larger gluten-free and ""paleo"" centered selection of produce, meats (cage free and non-GMO available) and ingredients.

- samples from the sushi bar

- a huge variety of wines and spirits with local and out of state choices available

- self check-out for convenience

- a selection of ""as seen on TV"" items

- SLOTS (oh Las Vegas)

I enjoy Smiths for most of my quick, last minute shopping choices (and with their discount card, you get $0.20 off gas for every 100 points earned at the Fabulous Freddy's gas status conveniently located behind the store). The variety of choices gives everyone a chance to find what they need while the store is conveniently open 24\/7. Some of the down falls I've noticed was in the occasionally grumpy employee (cashiers mostly) and a rather crowded layout making it hectic with traffic during peak and busy days\/hours.

"This Mexican place is located on and\/or near a golf course...? Possibly a retirement community? That is the clientele for sure. It is kind of like a diner in a Midwest town that attracts the olds to have coffee and eat really bland Mexican food at ""that one thar Mex-ee-can"" place.

The tables have no hot sauce on them. HUH?

The menu does not feature burritos. HUH?

I had an a la carte chicken burrito that didn't come with ANYTHING. No salsa. No sour cream. No guac. HUH? 

I mean, I get that I ordered it a la carte, but not even a dollop of sour cream? Makes you go hmmm. The chicken was sub-standard and didn't have much of a sauce in it. As I sat there eating it I was envisioning a Chipotle burrito I could have gotten for a dollar less and it would have been a thousand times better.

Maybe I should have ordered something different, but for a place called ""El Burrito"" I was shocked there was not a plethora of burritos to choose from.

I say go to Chipotle over this place if you want EL BURRITO.

"Not impressed.  We have an excellent nanny, but we were lucky.  I feel that the agency only cared about getting the fees, not finding a right match or helping us with the search.  They made an easy $1600 from us and haven't called to see if we are happy, nor have they called our nanny to check on her.  They won't hesitate to call if they need something though.  I expected more. I will say that Beth was super sweet every time we spoke with her.  Her partner is not, nor is she helpful.",1.0
"My wife and I moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles in 2004. We have never regretted that decision because LA is a dehumanizing place to live. At least it was for us. One thing, though, that we encountered when we got here that we didn't have to deal with in Los Angeles was extremely hard water. I didn't even know what that was when we got here, and was surprised that so many people here had water treatment for their own homes.

Once I realize this is something that we needed, I started researching. Being a thorough kind of person, admittedly to a fault, I looked at a lot of different companies. What I was surprised to find is that they all said something different. Some of the claims were truly amazing, like you could wrap a wire around the pipe or connect magnets to it and you would make your water ""soft"". Those were easily debunked, but some others were more sophisticated. People talked about mixed media in multiple stages, and energy cells and all kinds of other things that a person without a degree in chemistry would have a hard time following.

Then one day I walked into a Home Depot store and there was a display in the store for a company called Kinetico. I arranged to have someone come out and show us what they had, and I was truly impressed. The salesperson was very knowledgeable, took the time to thoroughly explain water treatment and how it works and then gave us a lot of choices.

They had the same type of systems that the other national brand companies in town had, but also showed me something I hadn't seen before. This was a system that worked off of the flow of the water rather than electricity. Very clever, I thought. It did cost more than the others, but it also is designed to last four or five times longer than they do. So I purchased that system.

We got purification for drinking water, carbon filtering for taking the chlorine out of the water and of course the water softener.

To date, no complaints. Quite the contrary, I feel they've delivered on everything they promised and have been nothing less than professional every step of the way.

Reading the other reviews here, I'm wondering if we're talking about the same company. I guess people are more likely to complain than praise, so maybe the company is not perfect. But I can only go by my experience, and so far I've been thoroughly pleased with the product and the people who stand behind it.

Would I recommend it to my friends and family? Yes, absolutely. As a matter fact, I have and a number of them have gotten Kinetico systems. I've never heard any complaints from them, so I assume that they are happy with the company as well.",1.0

Also, this store seems to have a lot of specialty health food items which I always keep an eye out for but seldom see anywhere. These items are usually expensive at any store but for a treat once in a while they're worth it and I'll be buying some of these things here as well.",1.0
"Top rated equipment installed expertly.... Mike helped me out with a quote on a new system for our house. Our builder Airflow unit was functioning, but was super loud and I knew it was just a matter of time. I had a few others give me a quote and didn't like their equipment, cost or sales tactics. Like offering me a ""free cruise""... or a Costco card as a rebate. Why not just give me the fairest price up front instead. Mike was good to talk to and made it simple. He told me about the equipment, was very knowledgeable, and it was all top of the line American Standard products that have been the top rated equipment for years by Consumer Reports. Cooler Tymes standing with ROC and BBB were great as well as the yelp reviews so it was really just about cost at that point. Mike was very straightforward with the pricing and sent me everything in writing and it was less than the others by a substantial amount. His people were top notch friendly guys and were in and out with as little fuss as you could probably have with people in your attic and outside replacing a whole system. We've noticed the temperature being more stable, the system is whisper quiet and our electric usage has gone down. I'd definitely recommend Cooler Tymes if you need service or a new system.

There looks like a disconnect between the male and female servers: the male staff looks very professional in shirts and ties, but the females (even with ""dress shirts"" and ties) don't look professional at all, more like what a high school girl would consider ""professional."" (For more clarification, the men are dressed how you expect restaurant managers to dress, while the women were a tad on the sloppy or too-casual side). My server (well, most of the female servers) was inattentive, bringing me a refill for my drink when I was clearly finished with my meal, and all of the women seemed to congregate near the kitchen or next to the bar to chat and joke.

"I have sadly been to this On the Border more than once due to family members liking it. I just don't get it. The food here is substandard 'Mexican' that tastes extremely salty and is loaded with sodium, calories, and fat (their fish tacos have over 1800 calories... whoa). Their portions are outrageously large. Don't bother looking at their nutritional facts, it will make you sad.... And yes, I get it , Americanized Mexican food is generally bad for you, but at least it tastes good at other restaurants. To their credit, they do have a 'healthy' menu that lists the calories, unfortunately this food is also not very good. On my most recent visit, I got the 'healthy' combo with an enchilada and fajita taco with a side of grilled veg. The veg was fine, the taco tasted like they dumped a bunch of that lime juice that comes in the green bottle all over some prepackaged precooked chicken slices... not awesome, but made better by adding some of the grilled veg and some salsa to it. The enchilada was also nothing special, but not terrible. The husband's enchiladas were a 'salt lick.' A family member ordered the guac, which they made table side. I don't even know how they could make fresh guac so flavorless. I would not recommend on the border to anyone and am keeping my fingers crossed that I will not have to make a return visit.",1.0

I went with some friends for dinner here. I got the kielbasa with sides of pierogies (50c extra) and corn on the cob. It comes with a garlic roll and unlimited trips to the salad bar.Well worth the $11-something I spent here.

I loved the kielbasa! I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I had fresh, homemade kielbasa but it was appropriately salty (compared to the packaged ones at the store which are almost always too salty for me), had a nice bite to the outside and was moist. My corn on the cob was actually a whole corn! A lot of places cheap out by giving you canned\/frozen corn or half a corn on the cob, but this one was the whole thing. And it was moist and flavorful. The garlic roll was fluffy, and the pasta and potato salads were tasty as well.

My only criticisms were that one of my pierogies may have been sitting out for a while and developed a bit of a crust on the bottom so it was not as pleasant to chew on, and the lettuce was too ""wet"" so my dressing didn't quite hold on my salad. I mean, I guess if anything, this means they wash their produce?

We started with the Pub Grub, which was homemade chips (warm) with a beer cheese sauce and bacon on them.  They didn't look like much but they were very good.

I typically order medium-rare meat, but they only do medium-well burgers.  To me medium-well is almost a guarantee of a dry burger, but not in this case. I'd say they were done perfectly.

I had the Bacon Mac n Cheese burger and my wife had the slaw burger.  The mac n cheese on mine would have been delicious on its own, but it was the burger that stole the show.  Very tasty, with the right amount of seasoning combined with great beef from Knoche's (same used by another establishment known for its burgers).

The pricing was reasonable on the food but be careful on the beer, my limited run Avery Pump[KY]n Bourbon Barrel Aged Imperial Pumpkin Porter was $10 for a small snifter (and worth it).  A few kinks to work out yet as the Pub Grub didn't ring up at the sale price and wasn't caught by the staff.  

Brews Bros keep it simple but execute what they offer well.  Overall it was a pleasant lunch experience; family friendly and tasty so we'll definitely be back!",1.0
"Cool place. Impressed with it all. Good food, good selection of draft beer. Cool music, nice ambiance. Went for dinner with my wife and 1 year old son. Surprised for such a cool downtown place to see high chairs and an outdoor grass area for my son to play in. They had the outdoor beanbag toss games on the lawn and he had a great time even though I'm sure mostly adults play.  Staff friendly and helpful. We will be going back.",1.0

This place is GREAT!!  We were having trouble with our Xbox - a lifeline for our 10 year old.  I thought we would have to tAke it to Henderson to get fixed.

"Literally can't five-star this hard enough. I went for my first time today with my girlfriend (I usually have to really twist her arm to get her to eat BBQ) and we both loved everything. I have been a big fan of Joe's in Gilbert and Brian's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek. I'm happy to say Astor House is doing a great job representing Phoenix. They do things a little different and while a traditional southern BBQ this is not , don't let the slight divergence from tradition dissuade you. The ribs are so tender you can just sort of shake the bones out and eat the good stuff with a fork if you're so inclined. The pork shoulder was also mind-meltingly, perfectly scrumptious and had a perfect bark and distinctly smoky taste. Sauce with everything was served in the side and was a perfect complement to something I thought couldn't get any better. I'll definitely be back with the quickness.",1.0
"I decided to try this pizza since my son seems to like it and he orders on Grub Hub all the time.  I placed my order with mypizza.com and waited for an hour.  At the hour mark, I called and was told the order was already on it's way.  I waited another 20 minutes and called again...I was told it was already on it's way.  I waited another 5 minutes and then called again.  My pizza arrived as I was on the phone and the delivery driver admitted that the owner did not know what he was doing.  I then got my pizza inside and tried a piece and it was not even close to being hot...I called back to complain and the manager hung up on me.  I called back and the owner answered and said that it was crazy that I kept calling and that there was no way the pizza was not hot.  Bottom line....I had to cook the pizza in my own oven to get it hot....at that rate, I should have gone to Papa Murphy's!!!

It was very easy to find and I'm so happy there was parking.  Although parking can be a little tough, its not too bad and its free... not metered.  It gets super crowded, but everyone is friendly so you may have to wait your turn if you want a picture without too many people in it.

Driving there and parking is not as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't hit any traffic and only spent less than 5 mins looking for parking. I parked for $15 at lot that was about 2 blocks away near the Dufferin gates. Place is packed with people having a good item. It hasn't changed much which I liked. Some great exhibits, this year they had sand castle competitions, sculptures made out of butter and a great acrobatic show. The laser performance was so awesome, blew my mind! Of coarse the food, we had chocolate fried chicken... Mmm Mmm Mmm! And there were lots of rides and games.",1.0
"Super disappointed. I paid over $80 for a style that didn't end up looking like anything I'd asked for. I was willing to pay the premium price for a special night out, but I left without the look I had requested. I would have asked for a redo, but by the time it was finally finished, I was already running late. Also, what's with all the other reviewers sipping on champagne the whole time? No drinks were offered, even though it was my understanding that it was a bar and salon. All in all, a lost gamble on my Las Vegas vacation.",1.0
"We chose Mr. Maid based on some research.  We met with the owners at our house and we were very impressed.  We hired Mr. Maid and they came to our home 3 times and we were very happy with the overall job that they did.  Now came the interesting part.....After the 3rd visit I contacted the owners and asked for a price reduction because the time spent at our house cleaning was well under the initial estimation by the owners, and time onsite really determined our total cost of cleaning.  I was polite to them and even told them that I was very happy with their cleaning job.  I told many people about them and made many recommendations for them.  The owners seemed to be reluctant to lower the cost.  They did finally drop the cost a little bit, and I was fine with that.  Then, for some reason, they called and told me the cleaner that was at our house quit and they had nobody else to cover at the time.  They siad they were actively trying to hire a new person.  Weeks went by and I heard nothing from them.  I contacted them a few times and asked when they would show up to clean.  They gave me the same response.  It has been 5 months now since they walked-out on our job.  I treated them with respect and was always very nice to them and their staff.  I am a businessman and understand how you should treat your customers.  I have now learned that they do not respect their customers, and I am still trying to understand why they skipped town on us when I gave them so many good recommendations and good opinions on their cleaning work.  Overall, if you can get them to commit, you will probably get a good cleaning job.  But I wouldn't bet on it based on our overall experieince with the owners.  Very poor business ethics displayed by them.",1.0

"4.5 STARS

My buddy and I popped in here for a late lunch.
What a great place to play hooky from work.
The staff were super friendly and the ambiance is really cool.
Maybe not the best place to watch a ball game but a nice place to kick back and chill.
Started with a couple beers. Not a huge selection on tap, but still plenty for a beer fan like myself. Our pints were nice and cold. Really hit the spot.
We started with the meat lovers pizza. Superb. Thin crust. Cooked perfect in their pizza oven. Tasted great and you could tell everything was freshly made.
My buddy had the Smash burger with fries. He said it was very good. A man of few words. He cleaned his plate though, so good sign.
I had the BBQ beef brisket grill cheese with fries. Fries were very good and plentiful. The brisket is where lunch derailed. So Much Food. I was done. It was cheesy, moist, tender and sweet. So good but I could only finish half the meal. That half sammy is going to make a great lunch tomorrow though.
My only complaint is price. Kind of following the trend of pricier bistro type establishments. 
Still, it was a really nice experience. Would definitely pick it over a place like Milestones if I were looking for an upscale casual meal.",1.0

"Not pleased. I've lived here for 3 months and I am sorely disappointed. Initially, Dorsey Place seemed like a good choice; nice apartments, great location, and friendly staff. Oh, was I wrong! From the beginning, the staff couldn't figure out how to spell my name, which resulted in constant miscommunication. It took a minimum of three phone calls to solve that issue. After we moved in, we had a host of complaints that weren't addressed until very recently including a broken back door, a broken fridge, and chipping paint. They advertise that you can pay your rent online, however that is not true. I tried doing so and thought that my troubles with Dorsey Place were over. Nope. They never charged my bank and returned my payment. They ended up charging me a $50 fee for insufficient funds (which was not accurate) and threatened to take me to court, although I had received no summons. All in all, this place has it out for you. They're looking for young, college kids who don't know much about renting apartments and are looking to commit fraud against them. If you're thinking of renting here, keep looking. Not worth it.",1.0

"I've gone here twice now, once for breakfast and once for lunch. I would probably give this place 3.5 stars, but half stars aren't an option and I don't think they deserve to go as low as 3. First, I am a fan of local businesses and I was very happy to find this place as it is much better than many other local businesses near me. They are very family friendly and at my first visit brought some fruit out for my infant to munch on while we were there. The food was pretty good. I had the turkey club on my first visit and it was huge and delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich the second visit and it was alright. It wasn't the best or the biggest I've ever had, but the eggs and bacon were cooked perfectly. I also had the cinnamon roll and it was huge and very good. It had a little too much frosting, but it was large enough to snack on the rest of the day. I also like that they use good quality meat for their sandwiches. I would definitely suggest to give this place a try. It's not the best local restaurant, but I'll definitely be returning. 

I do have to mention that the cleanliness could use improvement. My first visit it was very sticky and I had to clean the table off with some baby wipes. The second visit was better, but it was first thing in the morning so I would expect that. This is the main reason I would have preferred to give 3.5 stars instead of 4, but it's still a good place to go.",1.0
"The lineup is scary. You walk\/drive this place and it's obvious that it's the bright and shiny new place. You line up for 20 mins to get two cookies and some ice cream. Is it worth it?

So I had the vegan cookie with Havla ice cream. Usually I love black sesame ice cream so I thought Halva (white and black sesame) would be great! But, I think it needs slightly more bite.

It was a generous portion of ice cream and big cookies, but for $7.50, well I'm just not sure.

I like the simplicity of the place and how it's ironically next to a restaurant that just seems to be its opposite. With the tubs of ice cream in background with names of what they have, no need for anything more.

I also like how they have a fair amount of servers to just grab your order. Any more and they need a bigger kitchen.

"I am not a big fan of this store when compared to the next closest location on Indian School & Hayden.  While this location is the closest to my house, I tend to avoid going here. The layout is odd. It is trying to be an AJ's, I feel (Bashas' owns AJ's and Food City, as well). But it is unnecessary since there is an AJ's 2 miles away.

The layout of the store is weird to me. I feel the interior aisles have no real rhyme or reason, and they do not flow logically.  The store was remodeled a few years ago and I had hope that it would feel more like other newly remodeled locations. It is dark. The middle door dumps you right in to the thick of the registers and self-checkout islands. The floral department is stuck in a far corner by the seafood, which is across from the lunch meat.  

And of all the locations, I feel this staff (at least the night staff) is the least friendly. I never get eye contact or even a ""hi"" without saying to them first.  I think this store, the staff, and the management needs to try a heck of a lot harder.

"Let me start with some small print: I'm Dutch. Therefore I came into this place with a certain expectation of what the food would\/should be like. (For those who don't know, Indonesian cuisine is very common and very good in Holland and the owner of this place is Dutch).

I'm also tall. Sitting at the bar is impossible and sitting at the front tables is uncomfortable. Otherwise the design and decor are very nice. The cardboard menu is cool.

We had the chicken satay skewers to start. I was hoping for some more peanut sauce on them, but the chicken was nice. I would have had more if they weren't so expensive.

Then had the babi pangang. Disappointed with it. Bland and mushy. Far from the great tasting babi pangang in Holland. Would never have that again.

The menu is not nearly descriptive enough. I ordered a chickpea Mediterranean salad expecting falafel on a bed of lettuce. What I got was curried chickpea cakes on swiss chard and kale...disgusting. Not to mention two salads and lemonade cost $46. Never coming here again.,1.0
"Oh, St. Francis, how can you get is so right, but so wrong all at the same time?!?!?

I particularly love their HH menu with delicious meal choices stolen right from their regular menu for under $10 and $5 cocktails before 6pm every day, even on weekends. To have a great HH in Cenpho, you've got to have good food options and good drink options, not just one or the other. 

I've ordered close to half of the items on their menu and hands down, my favorite is the chicken salad sandwich. I usually order it sans toast, and without the bread. The dressing on the chicken salad is delicious, but slightly over powering, so I also suggest asking for half of the dressing. I also enjoy the Meatball appetizer, but I would suggest sharing this one with a couple of people. It's basically two or three big meatballs, while delicious, I've usually had enough after one and am ready for my chicken salad.

I always enjoy their vegetables; they're oh so delicious, perhaps even up in the amazing category. This has been hit or miss for me, but I usually try to get them to serve whatever their vegetable is that day. I enjoy St Francis for their fresh and delicious flavors, they can do some great things with veggies here, the trouble is they don't ever seem to want me ordering them. I'm at about 50 \/ 50 when it comes to them subbing out veggies for the fries, so when they don't seem to want to accommodate, I generally get the side salad instead. They usually give me some response like, the kitchen can't make you a side of vegetables, that dish comes with either fries or a side salad, and I ultimately give in on the salad. 

Honestly, why do you need to be so b*tchy about subbing out fries for vegetables, as if there is no kitchen back there. I'm not asking for free food, charge me for the change and call it a day. Is it impossible for you to imagine someone might NOT want to eat fries!?!?! 

On one occasion, I was here with a large party of 15 or so for a birthday meal. We made reservations and requested that separate checks be accommodated; well, it appears there was a breakdown between the person who made the reservation and the wait staff who apparently don't like doing separate checks. They refused to accommodate this request, and it started to get awkward. I was not looking to make a big deal out of it, I took care of the bill myself, and went on about our evening without upsetting the nights festivities, but that could have been handled better, much, much better than me paying for everything myself.

A few notes to St. Francis operations.
Why is it so difficult for your staff to accommodate something other than fries with a chicken salad sandwich? You're a restaurant, you make food, I want food, please make me the food, so I can eat the food and leave happy.

Why take a reservation with the stipulation of accommodating separate checks and then have your wait staff groan about how they can't do separate checks?

Staff should be accommodating where they can, I don't feel I'm being unreasonable here to expect to be able to order what I want to order, and pay how I want to pay.

I guess the moral of this story is, if you want to come with a large group, they will probably make a big deal out of it, so be prepared. If you want to change up your meal with something as *crazy* as vegetables, good luck. With all that in mind, I still think St. Francis is one of my favorite spots. I'll be back by myself for sure, I might even bring my friends, but only if I'm planning on covering the check.

"Well, the company it owns has been around for a decade (pre-dates Zuffa, who acquired UFC® from SEG), and yet there are no reviews for Zuffa, which is headquartered right behind the In-N-Out on Sahara. 

It is ludicrous that I am the first to review, since I have harboured deep disdain for Zuffa on and off for years (depending on what stupid shit they do), but I suppose I shall. Having wasted my fair share of time watching and money attending events and expos, I do not see why I shouldn't.

The first event I was able to attend live was UFC® 64, where Anderson Silva was first crowned Middleweight Champion. It was not my first MMA event, but it sure was on another level compared to the smaller (and even the big) events in Hawai'i. I was fortunate enough to receive an invite from another Yelper (Kevin P.) to go attend whichever numbered event it was where Silva was knocked dead by Weidman. 

In between I have been there to watch Lesnar take over the Heavies (I walked out, because I do not boo fighters); numerous changes of titles in Light Heavy; GSP reign supreme in the Welters; and some of the changes at Light (most in that weight class happened outside of Las Vegas). I even watched the Feathers and whatever the hell is below under a different company that Zuffa briefly owned before liquidating it into the Big Promotion: WEC®.

Zuffa has not been perfect. They feuded (and still currently blacklist) one of the most liked fighters of all-time: Randy ""Captain America"" Couture; they fired a top-ranked fighter for retweeting someone else's joke. They played favourites for years and in many ways still do with fighters they want to shield by booking stylistic mismatches in their favour. 

They fired Matt Lindland for being too good and therefore being a possible threat to dethroning Anderson Silva in a ""boring"" way before his legend could grow among the TUF®-era fanboys. (Don't get me started on The Ultimate Fighter®.) They bought up and then threw away\/swallowed some of the best organisations that existed outside of the UFC®. 

Through it all, I am still a fan. Of the sport, and by proxy: the company.

"Alzohour Market is a prime example of the recommendation not to judge a book by its cover.  It has the (rightful) appearance of a store, where you could buy Halal meats, canned goods and clothing, but there is really nothing to suggest it being a restaurant except for the few tables and chairs.  While the store is quite large, the amount of space dedicated to the dining area isn't and this is a shame.

Alzohour Market is a ""mom-n-pop"" shop, the husband being from Morocco; the wife being Syrian  (I asked, because there was a fairly wide selection of Bosnian items on the shelves -- as is the case in several Middle Eastern shops in the Valley -- and also, because there was at least one Bosnian dish on the menu).  Their respective heritages are readily reflected in the food, which, at times, may be somewhat different than what you're used to in Middle Eastern food.

We started out with the hummus and babaganoush as appetizers.  For the prices they charge, the portions were more than acceptable.  While neither was typical of similar dishes we've had in the Valley (the hummus came with a variety of vegetables garnishing it and the babaganoush had onions and was somewhat 'gelatinous'), both were very tasty and neither of us had any complaints about either (except a difference of opinion as to which was tastier).

My partner then had an order of cheese pie and one of meat.  While the wife part of the team (part chef; part waiter; and part marathon runner) stated the cheese pie would be like a ""burek"", it really wasn't (but that's irrelevant).  At $2.99 each, the sizes of each were good and could easily have sufficed as either an appetizer or even a meal in itself  (in fact, after splitting the hummus and babaganoush, and then having these two pies, my partner was -- amazingly -- full ... no mean accomplishment, if you've read my other reviews and know how much of a glutton we both are.  That nevertheless did not stop him from helping me polish off my entree and half a dessert).  The cheese in the cheese pie is a bit salty, so if you're not a fan of salty foods, be advised.  The meat pie looks like a flat, pita-pizza and, in itself, is not very substantial.

I had the lamb tangine for my main entree and was pleasantly surprised ... especially as its no easy feat to find variety in a Middle Eastern restaurant out here.  The lamb was succulent and almost fell off the bone.  The stewed prunes and toasted almonds complimented the lamb splendidly and the sauce was finger-lickin' good  (yes, I had washed my hands beforehand).  Like most Middle Eastern restaurants, the lamb was served with way too much saffron rice, which, while very good, is something no diabetic should be tempted with! :-)

Though we were quite full  -- and glad we had hit the gym prior to coming here -- the owner recommended the Kunafa for dessert ... and it was a wise recommendation.  We've had this before in another restaurant in the Valley.  It was served cold there and I was not particularly impressed.  This time, it was served quite hot and the crushed pistachios and orange-blossom water really contributed to its wonderful taste.

In my opinion, were the owners to shut down the store part of this place, do some decorating and hire some waitstaff, this place could easily become a very decent Middle Eastern restaurant in its own right and provide some much welcome competition to other places in the Valley.  The minor discomforts of eating in a store, where the restaurant is not the main draw, should be overlooked this time.  It's quite worth it.",1.0
The place was clean both in the customer area as well as behind the counter.  The restaurant idea is novel similar to a Subway or Chipolte. I ordered two different doughnuts and was unimpressed.

Nothing special.  I went with a large group and no one raved about there food. So far that I would say 2 Stars for the food.  The service was decent - very pleasant.

"I love this quaint little cafe in the middle of Korea town. Previously knowing very little about Latino flavours, the friendly owner of this place, Aland and Maria, introduced me to the snacks and food that I would otherwise never know existed.  There is regularly a rotation of some photos and paintings on the wall depicting the life and scenery of Columbia. Never been to Columbia, this place is the proxy that helps me imagine being there.

There is an awesomely exotic collection of grocery items like queso fresca (cheese), traditional fruit paste made of guava, Columbian cacao beverage (Corona). They seem to update their selection frequently. I discover new things to try every time I visit this place.

This is becoming my favorite place for a casual lunch whenever I come to Koreatown for grocery or errand run on the weekend.

Now I appreciate that if you order fish online that it might be a little soggy when it arrives, having been steaming inside a box, but you don't expect it to fall apart and the batter to be able to be wiped off with your finger.

But worse than the awful fish, was the reaction I got when I phoned to complain. Which, given I'd just paid £7.50 for a cod supper, is not unreasonable. I was on hold for longer than I actually got to speak to anyone,  hearing the raised voices of the chef in the background, and was told that cod is greasy, or in effect, shit happens. Grease had nothing to do with it. And somehow I make it home the same distance when I collect with the fish in fine fettle. There was no apology, just excuses and being made to feel like an idiot about a valid complaint. The eventual offer to send another driver ""later"" sounded like it was a massive inconvenience, so I declined.

"Restaurant review:
Cheap tasty BBQ fresh from the smoker. I was excited about visiting this location because I drive by here everyday and I can smell the the restaurant smoking the pork everyday. The restaurant has very good prices for BBQ food with daily specials as well. They take your order you get your food when they call your number. One downside is that they charge you ten cents for a coupon of water. Who charges for water? We ordred the pulled pork sandwich which came with fries. The pulled pork was above average size. The BBQ sauce was a bit on the watery side which detracted from the experience. Fries were average, I would say the fries at Five Guys is better. Overall cheap, inexpensive, but not spectacular. My quest for BBQ continues in Champaign.

"Admittedly, we're the brunch type. We dig Hello Darlings 'egg' window - a yellow dot on the outside pane so when they pull down the white curtain on the inside - voila. Egg. Unfortunately the decent reviews we've heard so far didn't thrill us far past the creative window.

We were greeted by a very timid server, pointing us to where we could sit (we sat a part of the long row of tables nearest the front entrance). Immediately, the tables on either side had to be shifted, by the other patrons dining beside us, just so I could squeeze in to the bench seat. As my partner commented, if he ""stretched his arms out"" he could ""literally hug the person next to him, and the person next to that"". It was tight, but 'c'est la vie' in Toronto.

Unimpressive coffee ($2.50) and freshly squeezed orange juice ($4) in too small of a glass to be seen as of value. 

My brunch partner in crime and I both couldn't resist the promise of a breakfast poutine (hashbrowns, mushroom gravy, cheese curd, two over-easy\/medium eggs w\/ sides of a biscuit, salad and fruit) ($14). 

After waiting more that 30mins for our meals we got a taste: overall we left full, and pretty content. Unfortunately, we've also got high expectations of a glorified breakfast that we are spending $25 EACH on with tax and tip. 

A couple bites of hashbrowns were under cooked. I get weak in the knees for a savoury mushroom gravy so this one was too sweet to my liking. The biscuit as well is sweet - if you're into that then this is the place for you - not for me, sadly. The half cup of mixed green salad with a couple sticks of apple and carrot was poorly dressed. The pickled radishes on top were a delightful surprise and beautiful colour contrast. The fruit was fruit (1 strawberry, 1 grape (literally one), 1 perfectly ripe slice of thick honeydew and 1\/5th of a kiwi). 

I appreciated having different flavours in front of me - to jump from salad to biscuit to poutine is exactly how I enjoy eating. However, none of the components of this spread were done overly well. It was a bit of a flop for us.

We asked for our bill and took it to the cash register to pay. The empty pastry fridge looked sad. The open kitchen in the back allowed us a gander: to us it looked as though they are working with one flattop only. The lack of burners seemed to be what kept our meals from reaching us in an acceptable time.

All in all, we'll avoid this brunch spot in the future. We simply can't justify the $25 spent when the overall experience wasn't delightful. Best wishes to the Hello Darling team as they continue to grow and be a welcome addition to this developing  neighbourhood.",1.0
"O.C.D. Cleaning is the best cleaning service I have ever hired. I just purchased a home in Las Vegas last month that required some heavy-duty cleaning. Not only was the property extremely dirty from tenants who had occupied the house for years, but also acquired an extensive amount of demolition dust from remodeling I am doing. After having all of the tile floors and fireplace surrounds removed by a jackhammer, there was concrete dust everywhere. Stacy and his crew arrived on time and completed every aspect of the job that we discussed when he came to give an estimate, and then even more. I was so impressed with the amount of detail given to ensure everything was done right, the first time. If they came upon something that required cleaning and wasn't pointed out during the meeting, they went ahead and took care of it. 
 O.C.D. Cleaning came prepared to clean everything. They brought all necessary supplies and equipment--even a pressure washer to remove spots on the patios and a large oil stain in front of my driveway. I definitely recommend O.C.D. Cleaning to everyone.  I am very happy that I found out about this company and did not have a negative experience and waste money hiring people who did not perform, like has happened to me before.

"We went to this Toronto hotspot for dinner on a Saturday night courtesy of Groupon. We had made reservations and were seated promptly in the cafe side of the restaurant, where the piano is. Our server, Courtney, was great; she was patient, sincerely friendly and very nice. I tasted everything that we ordered from appetizers to desserts and it was all delicious. Everyone was pleased with their meals. The portion sizes were great and they were generous with the toasty warm bread and soft, room temp butter too. I liked that when we asked for water they didn't push various types of bottled on us. They were organized when it came to redeeming the Groupon and the Groupon menu was really good. Our only complaint was that it took a really long time for the food to come out. Our server compensated us for that by taking the coffees off of our bill without us even asking. The upside was that we got to hear John Roby tickle the ivories around 9:00pm, which was a pleasantly unexpected surprise. No restaurant is perfect on every single night so overall I would rate our experience a solid 4. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the regular prices are quite high (for example 6oz glass of Gewürztraminer $16) but it is Yorkville, so it comes with the territory. Oh! I almost forgot, it was my mom's birthday so the chef was thoughtful enough to write happy birthday on her dessert dish.",1.0

"I tend to seek out the vegetarian restaurants whenever I travel as I want to avoid meat (unless it's organic or free range) and I can't eat gluten. The only issue is I can't eat onion either and many vegetarian restaurants usually pile their dishes full of onion. At Henderson's Bistro this didn't seem to be a problem at all. I ordered the nachos which were gluten free, then just omitted the salsa and instead had a delicious bean salsa. It was delicious! Plenty of cheese, sour cream, guac and nacho chips. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really nice and we had a chocolate nut cake for dessert which was nice though it was quite heavy. The service was good and the bistro was obviously quite popular as it filled up around us. The menu is small but has a good range of options for everyone. I'd certainly eat there again.",1.0

I'm a fan of heat, so I liked that the pico had quite a bit of chopped jalapenos but if youre not, be sure to ask for non spicy pico (if he makes it, I didn't ask). It is called a Mexican grill so seems like his meats are all cooked on the flat top vs like chicken tinga.

"Different Point of View is a Lovely Restaurant with Breath taking Views. Most of the food and Service I had was very good. This would be a Four star review if a few execution problems didn't occur. I am basing my rating on price point.

Both entrees were less than warm especially the New York Strip. I don't order steak often but when I do I look forward to a very good steak that's tender, tasty and hot like off the grill.  My husband thought the steak was cold but I say it was room temperature. I didn't send it back or say anything because it was tasty and cooked nicely and I didn't want it cooked more and I also didn't want my husband's Pork to sit more. My waiter did come to check on us and asked how it tasted and I said fine because it did taste fine.

At this point I was teetering between three and four stars.

But another execution problem occurred with the Chiffon Date Cake. The cake is made ahead of time and kept chilled in a refrigerator. I am certain that freshly made the Pistachio Cream is delicious but after chilling it just turned into hard putty that you can't eat. Other issues with this dessert are I didn't recognize anything in the Chiffon Date Cake as Dates. I don't know if the cake had dates in it. I don't know if I got the wrong one either.  I tasted the cake and to be honest it tasted like a dry sorta sponge cake. I do note the coconut lime saffron sorbet was delicious and I used that to soak and moisten up the dry sponge of cake. I did question the waiter about the cake and he assured me I had the correct one. He also said the pastry chef was on vacation.

"I have been in a few times in the past year for quick mani and pedi because its close to home. I am always al little weary of these type of places with high turn over and little evidence of proper sanitization. I don't ever see staff disinfecting items properly between customers and don't see an actual autoclave...
I wont be going back because I was cut 3 times during my pedicure. the attendant didn't acknowledge the issues nor did she apologize. she simply applied some blue substance from a little bottle from her pocket, I don't even know what that is. 
I paid but did not tip and said to the receptionist that I was most unhappy and would not be returning. she didn't seem to  care much.

"After reading good recommendation from Yelp, off we go to Nawab!. We arrived relatively early on Friday evening and restaurant was relatively quiet. Service was prompt, friendly and helpful.

So why the two stars? Value and food. My benchmark to any ala-carte Indian restaurant would be if it's any better than buffet Indian restaurant (in which you're paying a lot less for more) and the answer for Nawab is no. I found that the food is just average and all of the dishes we ordered (Vindaloo lamb, Rogan Josh lamb, tomato chicken?) was lacking of kick\/texture and the amount of meat contained is surprisingly scarce. The garlic naan we ordered was also slightly burnt (Although was enjoyable overall). 

Overall we spent $60+ for 3 meat dishes, 1 appetizer and 3 garlic naan which I found to be on the expensive spectrum and a terrible value for the food quality they serve.",1.0

My hubs and I always want to try a little of everything and I think we did, except they forgot to take our taco order!  It's okay, the amount of food they give you is a lot and you actually start to get full when trying all the dishes.  I did sashimi, the salads, appetizers and dessert.  I did the sashimi salad and you get a lot.  It's a full serving of a salad for one person and the garlic ponzu sauce is delicious and spicy.  You really get your money's worth!

My husband wanted to try this place out.  We went through the drive-thru.  He order a avocado burger w\/ cheese & bacon.  It took awhile to get through the drive-thru (service kind of slow).  Then once we got to the window you can smell the funk coming from inside the place.  Omg it smelled horrible!  I have heard of it being a funky smell inside but man I never was prepared for that type of smell. (That was the main reason why I personally didn't want any food from there). So we received his food and there was no cheese on his burger. He gave them the burger back and then they told us to pull around to the front so they can remake the burger. Why they have to remake the burger and just put cheese on it not too sure.  And why we had to pull up to the front when there no vehicles in the drive-thru not too sure about that one either.  Anywho the food was pretty good.. I tried some of my husbands food. He said he liked it as well but this place isn't worth going out of the way for.,1.0

"Ordered from this Domino's a couple times, and I have to say, I was quite happy with the result. We had the pizzas one time and the oven-baked sandwiches another, and while I could go on about either one (the sandwiches are to die for!), what really counts is that they were friendly, punctual, got our orders right, and the food was delicious.
Service times are a little higher for this location than others I've ordered from, so the delivery guy didn't get to our door quite as promptly as I'd have hoped, though it's forgivable because I think this location services a larger area than many others due to the odd layout and lower amount of delivery businesses in the area. When we lived on the northeast side of Vegas, there were a lot more restaurants that delivered to our area, and times were lower as a result. We didn't have to wait over-long, and they were still quicker than the Pizza Hut that delivered to our apartment off Rainbow and Russell, so they remain my pizza delivery place of choice.
The food arrived hot, another problem we had regularly with the Pizza Hut in the area. Maybe it's because they're faster, or maybe it's because Domino's has a better pizza delivery conveyance sleeve that keeps the food more insulated. Maybe their delivery guy is a fire wizard and kept the pies and sandwiches hot with the power of his mind, it could really be anything. The point is that the food arrived hot, which is intrinsically important to any delivery business--hot things should be hot and cold things should be cold. If I wanted to eat cold pizza, I'd go to the corner market, buy one, cook it, and leave it on the counter for a far lesser cost.
The delivery guys were always friendly to boot, as were the staff members that I called in to order from, so I'd definitely recommend ordering from here if you live in the area instead of Pizza Hut.",1.0

I didn't like the rice and the salmon was not A grade. This place is probably ok for lunch if you work in the area, but then you have Ajisen, 2 Ichibans, Sakura, Pho88 and some other Asian restaurants. A note to the owners of Wako: pay a visit to Japango or Yuzu No Hana and see what quality food at a Japanese restaurant tastes like. As to myself, you won't be seeing me back, I'm afraid.",1.0
"Wow. Went here with family while visiting Madison last week. Hit this place because it was Friday, in Lent, and they have cod!
The place is smallish so get there early. It fills up fast. Clean it is. Nice staff. Great menu. 
I had the clam chowder as a starter it was very nice. Rich and creamy although a few less potatoes and more clams are my preference. It had a real nice finish with a bit of a peppery kick. 
My sister ordered the house fries and we shared them. I was so glad I got more with my entree. They are cooked and seasoned perfectly. 
My meal was the fried cod with the aforementioned fries and the house made slaw. 
This included four huge pieces of fish. Fantastically flavored. Great batter and light flakey fish. Terrific! The slaw was creamy and gad a bit of spice to it. Really complimented the fish? 
Great selection on the fairly priced menu. Full bar too. We had a nice bottle of Chardonnay with our meal. $20. Seriously? Great price there!

"Marche Jean-Talon is a large farmers market further out from Montreal's city center. It's interesting to see some new produce that I have never seen in the US, such as ""cerise terre,"" which I looked up later to discover it's a smaller, whiter version of the cherry.

Some tips:
- All cash market. Although, I did see a few people pay in USD, so that should be widely accepted, especially with the higher exchange value of the USD. 
- Street parking on the weekends in the neighborhoods surrounding the market. I'm not sure where you would park on the weekdays. It would probably be better to take the metro.

Food stalls to try:
- Mexican taco stall in the center (with the big Marche Jean Talon sign)- serves 3 tacos for $5 of cochinita pibil, black beans, and marinated red onions
- Oyster and seafood stall at the end of the market, ""Explorer"" set of a dozen oysters for $30- 4 each from Vancouver (West Coast), _can't remember_ (East Coast, Ireland coast (European), and Rhode Island (American)

"I spent 6 months here, and I never really had any ""serious"" issues. I originally signed a 12 month lease, but ended up moving out earlier because my job moved me to another city.  Here were some Pros and Cons during my 6 month stay:

Pros:

- The grounds are very well kept. There were always landscapers out working, the place looked great from the outside in.

- Great location. The neighborhood is a little suspect, but everything you need is 5 minutes away. Home Depot, Petsmart, Fry's, Target, Wal-Mart. You're close to the freeway and Sky Harbor is about 10 minutes away. This is probably the most convenient location to have for a pretty reasonable price.

- The floor plans were very spacious and nicely laid out. 

- I lived in one the buildings that faced out towards McDowell Road. This road is very busy all the time, and I never really had any issues with noise. However, if I opened the windows I would hear some traffic, but it wasn't bad. They also did a nice job with tree placement - every window in my apartment was surrounded by trees and it was really beautiful.

- No bug issues! I never had a problem with bugs of any sort...ever.

Cons:

- The complex is gated, however, the gates probably worked for 1 week out of the 6 months that I lived here.

- The parking situation is terrible. Each apartment has its own covered parking spot, but there are hardly any uncovered spots for guests. Also, people parked in my covered spot ALL the time. I had a corner spot, so not only did people park there overnight, but people would double park behind me and used that area to load\/unload things. The towing policy isn't effective at all, so when people parked in my spot there was really nothing I could do about it.

- The appliances are very old. In the 6 months that I lived there my dryer broke, the garbage disposal was broken the day I moved in, the bathroom sink had to be replaced and a piece in the shower had to be replaced so I could get hot water running through it. On the plus side, the Maintenance guys were awesome, and all of my issues were resolved within a couple of days. It took about 5 days to get my dryer fixed.

When I first moved in there were always police helicopters flying overhead, but that only lasted a few months. There's definitely a lot of ""rif-raff"" hanging around the complex and living there. I lived on the second floor and I had a horrible family living below me that made a lot of noise and played music so loud every night I thought a night club was on the other side of the wall. They also parked in my spot constantly.

The walls were pretty thin in the bathroom, and I could hear the person next to me taking showers and I always heard their AC click on and at one point their pipes were leaking so I could always hear the dripping. Sometimes I could hear talking and I heard someone sneeze once. This was only when I was standing in the bathroom, though.

I never had my car broken into, and I never heard any stories of it happening to anyone else while I was there.

The fire alarm was pulled one night at around 3am and it was terrible. 

All in all I would say I didn't hate it here, but I didn't love it here either. I never used the pool or the workout facility and I hardly ever went into the office or interacted with the management staff. If I had to move back there today I probably wouldn't.",1.0

"As a preface in the past I've been happy with Open Wide Dental, and have been going here for almost 4 years now off and on, but a series of circumstances have left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. To begin back towards the beginning of the month I called them because I was having issues with one of my teeth and wanted a call back to see about any financing or if they could help me out in any way since I'm low income like they have in the past. No response after close to a week, this should have been my first sign, but I called again, they left a voice mail soon after with no real answer to my question, it was basically ""We'll see, maybe, after you see us"". Not really the kind of response I wanted since my concern was finances, what if I went in and they couldn't work with me now?

Anyway I took the chance (once again it is my fault for ignoring the signs) and called them back, made an appointment for a couple of weeks. The night before my appointment I became ill which was keeping me awake as well, so I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. To be fair it was past the normal 24 hr window (I left the message around 12 am because I knew there was no way I was going to feel good enough to go) cancellation I've ever made with them. I called them that morning to make sure they got my message, they did, and that was that. A week later I get a $50 ""no show"" bill sent to me. Which they have every right to do, but doesn't make it good business when you have a loyal customer who always shows up to their appointments, AND referred MULTIPLE people to their location. 

I was, of course, upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that I was a bit angry about it, but it was a civil message, even if I was clear that I would not pay the $50, that I felt it was a slap in the face, and because of our financial situation I would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasn't resolved. That was over a week ago and no response. So much for caring about your customers. If they are willing to lose me as a customer, and maybe future referrals, that is their prerogative but it seems like a bad move to do this over $50. But it seems consistent with my treatment I received with a lack of response prior to the $50 no show (which I didn't even know they had). 

Have to give them credit though, they did get my bill of $50 to me faster then any responses to my phone inquiries!

"(Review is for the Farmer's Market)
Came by here a few weeks ago while visiting Las Vegas. My husband and I came to check out the farmer's market (every Thursdays, 10-1 pm). By the way, there is free admission if you are only coming to visit the farmer's market and the garden. 

It is rather a long walk to the farmer's market from the entrance. When we arrived, I was rather disappointed because of the small number of vendors participating (maybe a total of 6 or 7 vendors). I just walked into the event room the farmer's market was held in and walked out in less than 10 minutes. 

We tried to walk over to the cactus but when we got there it was closed for construction. 

The Spring Preserve does look like a nice educational place to bring kids. There is also plenty of wide open space if they want to run, jump and play, as we saw many kids doing during our visit. I think it must have been a big school trip because there were many school buses in the parking lot. 

The gift shop and little library inside was nice. Most items are overly priced (as with most gift shops). There is free wifi from the library here by the way. Also the floor of the gift shop is cool because you can see some interesting items on the floor that is made of glass (plexglass maybe?). 

I think the admission for this place is a bit high. If you have a student ID though, you can get in for a cheaper price ($17.05 per student).

"Huuuuu... I had high hopes for this place. I was here with a group and once we were seated, I was excited to order something delicious. However i wasn't all that hungry, so I decided to try my hand at something simple... I mean real simple. I ordered a Grilled Cheese and tomato sandwich with cheddar and Monterrey with a side of fruit. 

Let's see...where do I start? 

Once the plate came out I was excited to dig into my sandwich. Although simple, I love grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, and figured no one can mess this up. Right?.... Wrong. 

After I took a bite, I noticed they forgot the tomato. I told the waitress and instead of bringing my sandwich back to actually grill a tomato and cheese sandwich, she brought me a bowl of 4 tomatoes. :-\/... Now, my sandwich is grilled. So I had to pry apart the gooey cheese filled sandwich so I can stick a cold slice of tomato in. Smh.

Then! My fruit. How can sliced fruit be bad? Well I'll tell you... It was warm. Why is my fruit warm??? The watermelon looked old, like they gave me the leftovers and they barely gave me any pineapple, which looked old as well. At least the two slices of orange I had were just okay... Again it was warm.

The stud decided to take me out to dinner Saturday and it was a last minute deal, so we sat in the large bar area at a high top. The space is quite large with the bar separated from the main dining room with a peekaboo architectural wall and a terrace of tables upstairs. The crowd is lively but more mature than the uptown crowd, so think 5Church but grown up. They have some unique cocktails that are quite boozy. I tried one with a pecan orgeat and rum, and hubs had a rye and apple cider cocktail with lavender that was lovely and perfect for fall. 

The food concept is farm to table, and the menu changes regularly. We started with the butternut squash with walnut oil and fried sage.  Then I had the second course of clams. You don't often see just clams on a menu around here, mainly because mussels tend to be more flavorful. The flavor profile was wonderful- the clams were paired with a smooth arugula pesto, apples and pecans with savory white wine foam and some crispy kale on top. I don't know how they get so much flavor in that foam! 

Hubs had the braised short ribs with ginger braise over mashed potatoes. The short ribs were the most tender he (or I) had ever tasted. It was pretty incredible. The mash was fine, but nothing amazing. We should note, he also ate all of the small, savory rolls because they were so delicious. 

I'd echo what Chris H said about the servers- they were all incredibly knowledgable, and apparently had all tried the menu. it's my pet peeve when you ask about a dish and they hadn't tried it. Our server, Amanda, was up there as one of the best servers we'd ever had. Even the guy that brought us utensils was amazingly friendly and informed. Jessica came over and talked with us like we were old regulars. She informed us that they will be open Sundays for brunch in December, along with lunch service.

Bottom line: Amazing service, inventive flavorful menu, great interior = one of our new favorite spots.

I think it's a trade off between quality and quantity. also the restaurant smelled kinda old so I'm glad I got take outs instead.,1.0

"Well the saying "" You get what you pay for"" is certainly true!  I have been here in this hotel for two hours and have already been more than ready to leave! Having to wait in a long line for 30 minutes in unacceptable just to check in. We arrived in our room to find dried urine all over the toilet seat a ball of hair on the floor big enough to make a wig and a large beer stain on the carpet that was still wet. I called the front desk and asked for the manager, and received his voice mail. I informed him of the problems and he assured me that room service would arrive to fix the situation promptly. Well 2 and half hours have passed and the mess is still there. I did win a $1800 jackpot and had to wait for a hand pay and that took 45 minutes~!!!! READY TO MOVE UP THE STRIP!!! This place is a mess!

I enjoy Hinote because it is a smaller establishment. It means that you might have to wait a little longer for service if there is a spike in people coming in all at once, but generally speaking, the service is good.

We came in for lunch at around 1:00 (opens at 12 on Saturday) and it was pretty quiet (3 tables including us). Not 20 minutes later, the place was pretty much filled.

I had the Black Cod Shoyaki special and my mom had the Sashimi Lunch special. We also ordered a Sushi Appetizer to share. The portions for sashimi were quite generous and the fish tasted quite fresh.

"We have patronized this restaurant from the day it opened. The food is typically great, but the service is spotty. The front of the house can get very backed up and on a recent evening that happened again to us. WE waited over 2 hours and 15 minutes to get a scallop appetizer salad. We had thought they forgot and we were getting ready to leave, when it came out. We tasted it and it tasted like cooking fuel--a definitely tainted toxic taste, so we returned it to the chef and said to just take it off the bill. 
He refused ! It was not edible, and after an otherwise perfectly fine albeit, slow and expensive ,meal was ruined because he chose to keep the 9.99 app on the bill, even though we waited 2 hours, and it was not palatable. After having spent thousands of dollars at this place, we are done for good. The arrogance was unnerving !",1.0

-Bananas foster pancakes, my favorite! The sauce was amazing--not too sweet =)
-Pineapple pancakes, tasted like pineapple upside cake!  Also, tasted like there was like some kind of liqeur in there...rum? Probably not. Had mine with cream cheese syrup (extra 0.75)

-Loco moco w\/ garlic rice, patty sucks...plain and simple. It didn't have any flavor. Seemed like a frozen patty. I thought they made their own? Oh well. Not ordering this anymore.
-Adobo fried rice (Our server called it ""adoBE"" fried rice...hehe). This one was a winner, actually BETTER than the other locations. Massive portion and lots of adobo chunks. Enough for two people to share.
-Chili loco moco, pretty good, except they use the same boring patty and really skimp on the chili. Wish they topped the plate with more chili.
-Kahlua pig grilled cheese, eh OK. It is missing a flavor profile. Maybe add a slaw for tang and texture or a nice aioli?

"STAY AWAY""---SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE MCDONALDS that is there in the parking lot instead. First time going, will not be back.  My wife and I and our young son stopped in on a Sunday morning.  For being the only restaurant any where close except for McD's for b'fast we decided to give it a try.  At 8:00am no one was there, was not a good sign and we soon discovered why.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good.  The gravy had pieces of sausage in it and was also good.  The eggs were fluffy and light.  But the potatoes were sliced home fires style that appeared to have been re-warmed, possibly from the day before and just barely warm and was tough and chewy.  Not good at all.  The meal did not come with biscuits and gravy as a chicken fried streak should, not even toast was included.  Disappointed.  My wife had an omelet that only came with toast, nothing else.  Disappointed again.  My son ordered pancake on a stick with scrambled eggs.  The pancake on the stick was burnt and should not have been served to a customer.  I showed it to the waitress when she placed it on the table and she did not offer to replace it.  Disappointed for the third time.  After all the disappointments the bill was still nearly $30.00.  The place has so much potential of being a gold mine with the location but as the lack of people that was not there should have warned us to stay away.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK...",1.0

"I have been to Lemon Falls a couple of times ever since I started working in the area back in January. Their vegan chili is my go to, especially in the colder months. Now, that I think about it I have never gotten anything from here that I didn't enjoy. The only real problems with Lemon Falls are the wait times and the prices. I just don't understand how it could take 35 minutes to pour a bowl of premade soup... I mean, maybe I am missing something here? All I know is any time I have ever ordered from here I have had to wait at least 25-30 minutes. It has gotten to the point where I don't really go anymore because I don't want to waster half my lunch break standing around.

Then I asked for Green tea, he asked ""What kind?"". So I asked him what kind they had and he said ""Well we have hundreds of teas, you can chose one of the many in green"". Fine, I chose a Jasmine and his response ""Oh well if you want that one, I recommend the higher quality blah blah"". Instead I decided I wanted one of their Earl Grey teas, to which he responded ""Why would you want Earl Grey"".

"* This is review is mainly on entree items, not sushi. 

Tried this place for the first time yesterday and I'm soo mad that I didn't get to take any pictures cause my phone died :( 

Soo if you know this area, you know that this place went through several owners like Bernard's Bistro and thus we get a shiny silver diner Japanese place Lol. I'm happy that the chef and sushi chef were both Japanese so that's a plus. We decided to share a whole bunch of items: braised pork belly (kakuni), Japanese fried chicken (karaage), seaweed salad, eel bowl (unagi don), a dragon roll and tempura ice cream.

Kakuni: wasn't what I was expecting but it was delicious. Super tender, came served in a bowl with rich broth and eggs.

Chicken Karaage: always a favorite of mine, super light and salty in a good way. Came with about 6-7 pieces.

Seaweed Salad: Soo good. I hate when a place makes it super dry but here they make it perfectly with the right balance of sesame oil, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.

Unagi Don: a little on the pricey side compared to everything else at $18 but it is soo worth it. I have not seen such great quality eel probably since I left Okinawa. Super tender, probably about 6-7 pieces with each piece being two fingers in width. Yummy! Served with too much rice but honestly I haven't had an unagi don anywhere with a ""normal"" amout of rice lol

Dragon Roll: a pet peeve of mine was that it wasn't rolled tight enough, some pieces fell apart a little. They used a good amount of ingredients and not a ridiculous amount of rice so that's good. The eel on top was the same quality we got on the unagi don yumm. However I feel the sushi rice was made a little too sweet for my taste.

Tempura ice cream: we had the vanilla even though they offer a green tea version. The perfect ending, cold and warm and the tempura actually tasted like yellow cake Lol so good. 

Oh and they offer Orion beer! & at $8 for a liter! If you've never tried, it's an Okinawan light beer, kind of like a mix between Bodington's & Chang's beer.

The atmosphere is very casual, very...unjapanese lol looked like a diner still with bits of Asian flair but it was very clean and the food was good so no problem! I just wouldn't make coming here a first-date type of option.

I've driven by Zoss almost everyday for the last two years and have never tried it until now. And I must say, I'm disappointed in myself for waiting SO LONG!

"Perhaps no other eating establishment has such a wide swing in reviews as a buffet does.  And this is to be expected:  buffets rarely serve the best quality food; the spicing has to be near neutral to accommodate every taste and -- very important, but almost never considered -- we tend to appreciate and savor food less, when we have an unlimited amount of it and a huge variety.

That said, Jasmine Tokyo is no better or no worse than any other decent buffet, with the exception of providing more variety than most; having a very large amount of space, comfortably decorated; and not having that assembly-line feeling many buffets can't seem to avoid having.

Reading the reviews on Yelp, I can fully understand and agree with almost every opinion expressed from the 1-star reviews to the 5-star.  While it's absolutely true that this place probably has one of the best buffets in the Valley and has a much larger selection of Japanese food than Chinese, it is also true that most of the food won't blow you away.  The sushi is good, but not outstanding; the Chinese food is typical of almost every Chinese buffet; the desserts, the same decently acceptable food you can find in almost every cheap restaurant.  The big exception is the ice cream, which, while also not fantastic, is much better than you'd usually find in a buffet and -- MOST IMPORTANT -- is served to you by an employee behind the counter.  This might be inconvenient to people, who like to serve themselves or who might feel embarrassed about asking for seconds; but it's a very welcome change from the borderline, let's-be-closed-down-by-the-Board-of-Health policy of letting little kids with filthy hands and questionable hygiene scoop their own ice cream out of a communal bucket  (that, of course, doesn't apply to YOUR kids, dear reader ... everyone ELSE'S kids are slobs; yours, of course, aren't).

Service is fast, friendly and efficient.  

So, in conclusion, this really is one of the best buffets I've been to in Arizona; that does not mean, however, that you should expect a lot for what you're paying.  It may be, that some people will not consider a visit here cheap.  Perhaps.  But considering the variety in selection and the fact that I saw a number of people in there with stretch pants and wearing striped shirts they should have thought twice about wearing, it can't be denied, that this place is a good value for the money.",1.0

Well come on down to the Nitty Gritty! Especially if it's your birthday!

I was roped into coming to the Nitty Gritty for a girlfriend's birthday. It was her last night in Madison before moving back to Utah, and she was determined to do a ""Madison birthday"" at the Nitty Gritty. It was her big day, so I was ready to do anything. We came in around 8 and were greeted by a buxom girl in her early 20s, with a tan only matched by Chester Cheetah. Once seated, a agitated waiter quickly breezed through the menu and pointed out all of the birthday appropriate shots. 

I ordered a rum and coke to start, because honestly, how do you mess up a rum and coke? I received a coke and water, with a smack of rum to it. The birthday girl valiantly suggested shots, so we ordered a round of ""absinthe"" based shots that came out with glow sticks in them. Now, I'm not sure why the glow sticks were there, but maybe it was to distract from the fact that these tasted like a drink created to appeal to people who have heard of absinthe or the Green Fairy from Eurotrip, think it's cool, and don't know any better. Without going into more detail on the drinks, it suffices to say they were all diluted. Maybe this is a good tactic for a bar that attracts most of the binge drinking population of UW-Madison, or the newly minted 21 year old that is out to get completely hammered. The one redeeming feature of the bar that night was the shotski - four friends taking a shot from a ski. It was cute.

Do you remember burger day in middle school? The patties were uniform, charbroiled, and sat in a pool of brownish water until slapped on a bun into your tray? If you loved those burgers, you'll go nuts for the Nitty Gritty. Douse this sucker in ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, pickles, anything you can, because you're going to need it. Honestly, in a state that prides itself on its dairy and beef, why would you skimp on your burger? There are literally some of the best burgers in Madison to be found within a 3 block radius. Maybe they are hoping that the newly legal clientele still have a nostalgic sweet spot for those old cafeteria burgers (even I liked burger day when I was 13, but it's because it came with an awesome brownie). 

As for the sides: you can expect an anemic salad with some forlorn croutons, and fries that are probably better than they have to be considering the standard Nitty Gritty fare.

Finally, we were lucky enough to be here for POWER HOUR!!!!!!11111 From 10-11 PM they reduce the price of their drinks to their actual value considering the watered down alcohol content. 

In summation: friends don't let friends celebrate their birthdays at the Nitty Gritty. If you must, stop in for one shotski, a birthday drink, and move on.",1.0

This place was very disappointing. First off, we called to make an appointment at 4:30 which was somehow fine when we made it but :15 min later they called us back to reschedule for 5pm which was a little annoying. When we got there they seemed very disorganized and we waited in our private room for at least 10 min before anyone showed up. The Yelp price other reviewers posted did not exist. The only way we figured that our massage was actually 60 min was if they started the timer when they let our feet soak for 10 min before even touching us. One of the ladies left the room for 10 min mid massage to answer the front door! Are u serious?!? Every time the other massage guy left the room you could clearly hear him coughing\/hacking up a disgusting amount of phlegm. For a reflexology place they barely touched the feet with any pressure. Overall, very disappointing and will not be going back. Probably the worst reflexology place I have been to.",1.0

The prices are excellent the sales reps are excellent however management of this place is horrible. We went to return something that was broken since we had got it home. We had talked to several people about returning it for another one but when the other ottoman we had bought began doing the same thing we decided to just return it. When we brought it in the manager told us we were three days over the 20 day grace period and they wouldn't return it. The management was very disrespectful as well and really made it all worse. They ended up giving us store credit we didn't want. We won't be going back and we were loyal customers.,1.0

I have seen a lot of these ""foot spas"" around vegas and always thought they were for fancy pedicures... HA! Little did I know.  Basically, you walk in and it's very dark and there's relaxing chinese music playing.  We basically signed up for the 1 hour massage for $32.  What a steal! They soak your feet in fragrant water while they massage your head, shoulders, arms.  Once that's done they do your feet, legs, and back.  I had a good masseuse and she did a great job! It's clean and comfy and you don't feel any weirdness during the massage.  I was so comfy, I think I fell asleep for a bit.  Only thing was me and my friend were getting our massages next to each other and the ladies were chatting a bit, which was a little distracting.  But otherwise, you come for a nice massage for a decent price.  It's not the ""Spa"" experience that the nicer places offer but it's sufficient and does the job.  They do use a scented lotion for the massage and you keep your clothes on, so the massage is over a towel.  They did a great foot massage of all the body parts! I would recommend this place but I haven't gone to any other ones though.  It wasn't too shabby! Prices vary depending on how long you want the massage.",1.0

"The employees\/students at EMCC are very friendly, however, they can be very unprofessional. I feel like students run the campus and the adults sit and watch. It's been almost a month for the entire Maricopa county school district to process my one piece of paperwork, holding me back from financial awarding. I've been in arizona for 4 years and this happens to be the most unprofessional school I've had to deal with. Never, have I witnessed such a lack of work ethic in a higher education facility. I'm not even sure I want to attend EMCC anymore, for the simple fact that I've spent months trying to get prepared for school, when they may not award me at all. Why should I have to call every week to make sure you're doing your job? I see no justification in that whatsoever. I have my own job to do, so I'd expect them to do their job, not laugh and giggle on the phone because you're not used to the technology. Isn't that the reason you're working at the school? To learn?? It just blows my mind that they take an entire week to process 1 days worth of paperwork. I hope they get it together soon, especially for the safety of my education. I'd hate to be taught by the same people that can't even file simple paperwork.",1.0

"This place is known for their amazing Butter Chicken, so I had to try it. I know that Butter Chicken only represent a very little part of the Indian cuisine, but since it is present in every Indian restaurants, it makes a nice standard for me to see how good the place is.

To be quite honest, I was pretty disappointed with their famous Butter Chicken. The chicken was moist and tender, which was nice, however the sauce was way too sweet and had too much coconut milk in it. The lamb curry was very watery and salty, and had just a slight taste of cumin. The side salad consisted of few leaves of sloppy lettuce leaves and a slice of cucumber. The portions were very mediocre (at least the one we had) comparing to other places I've been to.

On the other hand, the lamb soup was quite nice, it was hearty and hot, perfect for a cold winter day.

"This place is nasty. It received 4 stars by some people?!?! No way!  Those people probably live in a barn. The rooms are dated. The rooms have popcorn ceiling, cheesy pictures on the wall, and funky carpet. I didn't want to take my shoes off. When I first came in the room I smelled a strong odor of smoke. Then I realized it was my hair that absorbed the smoke from just 15 minutes of being in the casino- the time it took to walk in and check in at the desk. The casino floor is so smokey. There are no good restaurants here. See my Dicks review.  There is  NO Wifi! Circus Circus is better. At least they have a steak house that is decent. Circus circus seems cleaner.

The salon there sometimes has better clearances than Ulta on Redken products, and they sell the coveted Moroccan oil.

They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)
The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled.

"Do people come here thinking, ""It's a famous chef's restaurant and it's fancy and expensive so it must be good!""?  Because as far as I can tell, either over 700 other reviewers are taken by the novelty or I'm missing something.  The two dishes I actually genuinely liked were the heirloom beet and chocolate bar for dessert, which had an almost silken texture and intriguing flavor, and the 
green papaya carpaccio as one of our appetizers, which was very tangy and bright.  I don't know what happened to the rest of the menu.  

The grilled skirt steak lyonnaise was great the first couple bites, but I soon realized the overabundance of the sickeningly sweet red wine jus, which overwhelmingly drenched everything underneath.  The potatoes -- soaked, not a singly potato-y thing left about them.  Not a jus-free spot remaining on anything edible.  
The szechuan beef tartare was truly horrible.  The first time I had tartare where I was strikingly aware I was eating raw beef.  It had no other flavor, despite being mixed tableside with spices by the expeditor.  We were asked how spicy we wanted it, we said very, so he added a ton and it still tasted of nothing but raw beef.  
The duroc pork belly lo mein had entirely too much lo mein, was too sweet, too salty, too fatty, too saucy, too everything while still not tasting of anything decent!  Just one big goop with no distinguishing flavors or textures.  
The drink-ordering system is just strange and inefficient.  You pick your drinks out on an iPad, but instead of zooming it off to the bartender like you assume it does, your server eventually comes and picks it up and puts it into the computer... so you think you ordered your drink 10 minutes ago, but you actually haven't until they come to take your order for them anyway.  

The menu items are incohesive.  We were missing silverware.  Some food and drinks took forever to arrive while others arrived very quickly.  There is a front bar area where people get drunk and yell at the TV all while you're spending over $200 on dinner for two, trying to enjoy a nice, peaceful evening out.  This restaurant just makes no sense.",1.0
"They just opened a new Pita Jungle near my work. I've had the opportunity to visit 3 times now. Twice for lunch, and once for dinner. 

Let me start out by saying, the primary focus of a restaurant should always be the food. You are going to eat. 

But the secondary focus is the experience. The reason you pay more, and leave a tip is for the experience. 

I can say, hands down, every single Pita Jungle I visit, the food is extraordinary, and the service is awful. 

Let's start with the latter, so we can end on a high note. They have a very relaxed vibe, which can sometimes make it hard to figure out who is a server, and who is just looking for the bathrooms. They dress like a hipsters paradise, which is fine, but at the very least a name tag, or apron would REALLY help when trying to track down a server. 

More recently when I visited for dinner with my folks, we had a young lady, who I assume was named ""Karma"" based on her necklace. She was nice enough. I arrived separate from my parents, so she brought me a drink. I had to flag her down to order an appetizer. Once my parents arrived,  she brought them their drinks and we literally did not see her again for 15 minutes. Not anywhere. She either has an invisibility cloak, or was trying to eat or... something. When we finally ordered, it took another 20 minutes for our food to arrive (1 soup, and 1 pesto pasta?). To her credit, she did refill my fathers lemonade multiple times, and brought him a ""fresh one"" when it looked watered down. But this was par for the course. I warned my folks about the lackluster service. 

Now for the food. Everything I have ever had a Pita Jungle has been wonderful. I love the Red Pepper Hummus, as well as the Cilantro Jalapeno. Occasionally the pitas are a bit stale, but at 50 cents a pop, I can't complain. My ""go-to"" order is the Falafel Hot Pita. It's majestic. All the flavor you could ask for. (though once they forgot the Tahini and it was dry as all heck but still flavorful) I also recently fell in love with the Pesto Pasta. The right amount of Heavy to fill me up, the the right amount of light so I don't feel FULL. 

All in all, if they could imrpove their service, even just slightly, I'd bump them another star.",1.0

"The last stop on our restaurant week eating extravaganza and this was by far the favourite of the four restaurants we tried. FYI we booked through opentable but the restaurant did not seem to have the reservation. Although the server and staff were extremely accommodating given this fact, I recommend reserving through their website rather than a third party like opentable just in case. 

The ambiance is perfect for a group setting or a romantic evening. Out of the four restaurants we tried this week, this was the first one where 2.5 hours relatively flew by and we didn't feel like we were waiting for service or the next course. I think it's because our amazing server ""checked in"" on us often and refilled our waters without us noticing we needed anything. 

The short rib and salmon tartare were amazing. I believe they're both on the regular menu so we will definitely be back to order these items again.",1.0
"I'm going to start this review slightly negative, which I think is okay because I did give Oma's 5 stars in my review.  My first visit was inspired by cravings for German food.  So I was (more than a little) disappointed when I arrived at Oma's Place and found it to be nothing more than a typical American sandwich deli that happened to have a 'German Dish of the Day' for $7.99.

Of course, then I ordered that first GDotD - which happened to the cabbage roll day - and was treated to two good sized pork cabbage rolls, lightly covered in sauce, with a side of warm and tangy potato salad.  The tagessuppe was Corn Chowder - served piping hot - in a light broth with lots of potato chunks and corn kernels.  It was amazing.

And then I went back again for another GDotD - on beef rouladen day - a single, good sized rouladen, exceptionally tender, with rich mashed potatoes and sweet red cabbage sliced unusually thick.

I'll make my way though the all the GDotDs eventually.  As for the rest of the Oma's Place experience, the lady at the cashier was super friendly.  The restaurant itself was open and bright - with huge windows - and several benches outside in the shade for some outdoor eating.  I'll admit it... I don't think I would head out here just for sandwiches (when in Phoenix, I'm down in Tempe), but I absolutely would for the german food.",1.0
"I'm a dive bar fan, and Shifty's fits the bill. It's a Raider bar on Sundays, so that's mostly when I go in, but they have a great steak dinner during the week for $9.75. Very tasty, and a good deal.  For you Raider fans, it's a great spot to watch the game. They have plenty of TVs all around the place, some really good food specials (sandwiches, chicken wings, and chicken fingers for $6.00 each), and GREAT drink specials (buckets of 5 domestic beers for $12, and cinnamon whiskey shots for $3.00 apiece).  And despite what the haters will always say about Raider fans...there are no thugs here. Lots of women were here...;-)

While they show only Raider games there on Sundays, it's not a spot with an ""official"" booster club there--and that can make a big difference. There's no ""booster club"" to join, no ""booster club fee"" to pay, (nor are there raffles to win Raider gear) and as such, there are seats available right up to kickoff. In my experience around the valley in other bars that had booster clubs, if you weren't in tight with the booster club officers, then there was NO WAY you were EVER going to find a place to sit down unless you showed up at least an hour or two before game time--and I'll be damned if I'm going to pay some ""booster club fee"" and not have seats!

"We went to this place Twice while visiting our favor8 zoo yesterday, once 4 lunch outside while viewing the flamingos from the patio under misters & l8er 4 dinner inside w\/ the AMAZING aquarium. Both Xs were THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE in Food, Service & Experience! 

   We were pretty famished after going all over the grounds running on empty in the heat & ready 2 c what offerings we could have from their extensive menu. We were pleasantly surprised 2 c there were several selections for us Veg~heads 2 choose from even tho they r known 4 their Bbq. Yay 4 us!! 

   Already a gr8 start, we were promptly greeted by an AWESOMELY ATTENTIVE server named HEATHER(server 40422) who took our drink & appetizer orders & single handed-ly gave not only us but the ENTIRE PATIO the most STELLAR service I've seen (esp 4 a place that busy)! Flustered was not in her vocabulary as she simultaneously got us started, other's served their orders\/refills, clearing pl8es, & wrapped up people closing their bills complete w\/ their discount coupons, making it Look effortless all w\/ a commendably friendly & professional winning attitude. This gal truly was impressive & I almost luved observing\/witnessing\/hearing her in action as much as the flamingos ~ WOW!!

   So we ordered passion fruit tea, Portabello Spinach Artichoke Dip 2 start, Peach salad w\/ prickly pear vinigarette dressing & their Spinach enchilada platter. Pl8es were Huge w\/ Generous portions & gr8 present8ion. As hungry as we were, we actually had 2 box up what we couldn't finish & run it our 2 the car. Everything we had became an instant fave & when I'm craving cold\/cool food I'll have 2 go w\/ the Peach salad which also had craisins, candied walnuts\/pecans over combin8ion greens & Perfectly complimented w\/ the Prickly Pear Vinigarette dressing (no arm~twisting needed). No room 4 dessert even tho there were def a few I put on the 2~try list 4 l8er. 

   Early eve had the expected w8 (esp since we showed up w\/o a reserv8ion) & we opted 4 outside patio again if it meant getting seated sooner, but much 2 our surprise we were asked if we'd like 2 dine inside near aquarium as 1 was cleared\/opened up. Can we say YAY Again 4 the unexpected upgrade? Nice~Woo~hoo!!

   We got seated right next 2 the aquarium near 1 corner of the curv8ure. Our w8ress this time was the very nice efficient Tobie (server 96534) who greeted us fairly quickly getting our order of their award winning onion rings started & tried the hibiscus green tea which was just as thirst quenchingly good as the passion fruit we had earlier. She was also a pretty Gr8 server ~ never had 2 w8 4 refills or our bill when ready. The only w8 other than 2 b seated of course was 4 our items 2 b prepared & nothing took very long ~ not 2 mention taking in all the beautiful marine life swimming right by us. I went w\/ the Spinach Quesadilla & my companion ordered the Prickly Peach Salad this time which had an interesting marmalade blended in2 the dressing. Yummy!! 

   The onion rings were pretty 1derful as was the Spinach Quesadilla & all the spinach artichoke dishes I'd highly recommend 4 those that like that kind of dip. The only thing I might suggest was the red onions being sauteed instead of raw even though it was still very good cut in2 julienne style pieces as well as ensuring all the diced tomato on our Spinach enchiladas r all ripe. Also the chips were very good tho just a couple a little over~fried, but some may prefer them that way. Why no sweet potato fries @ this loc8ion? Def woulda tried them... We really enjoyed the aquarium & knew not 2 expect a quiet uneventful dining experience as there is going 2 b excited kids about in addition 2 the hussle & bustle of any good establishment. 

   Really wish some parents\/grandparents would b better overseers of children\/toddlers. This is NOT a charity daycare\/kiddy playland 2 let them run rampantly unattended as servers already have enough obstacles w\/o having 2 watch 4 tripping over ur kids while attempting 2 get full trays of HOT food 2 their tables. Really, r u KiDding me?? I'm sure they'd b the 1st 2 scream lawsuit if that very possibly happened 2!! That's really sad when a stranger cares more by watching\/preventing something bad from happening 2 them SEVERAL Xs throughout our meal ~ Rediculous!! Yeah, go back 2 drinking but next time don't bring the kids or 4 gosh sakes pay 4 a babysitter since u don't watch them, not 2 mention the choking hazard every time I get knocked in2 from behind while trying 2 eat... Geesh!!

"As of now I'm not sold on the Container Park.  My biggest problem is that it feels too enclosed and private.  It wants to make Downtown Las Vegas seem cool and cultured; but only if you're inside the Container Park!  Only one entrance & exit?  I get carded to walk into here?  No outside food or drink?  Kids are allowed, but have to leave by 9:00pm?  It's great that they've tried to create a family friendly environment, but once you leave you're quickly reminded that you're still on the corner of Fremont and 7th.

My favorite aspect of the Container Park is that it focuses on showcasing local businesses.  There seems to be a decent mix of retail, food, and drink spots, along with spaces reserved for art galleries.  Be sure to stop by JoJo's Jerky.  Later at night a curfew goes into effect, which allows adults to have fun on the playground.  Neat, but not really something I feel needs a repeat visit.  First time visitors, though, be sure to check out the ninja game and three story slide!

"Once we had decided to transform  the little patch of rocks and scrubby looking bushes at the front of our house into an actual patio space, finding the right company to do the work began. We knew we wanted pavestones, so that narrowed the field quite a bit. But who would do a good job and for a reasonable price? I checked all the home improvement  magazines thoroughly and read every word of copy in the ads to look for signs of integrity and fairness. I was impressed with the Paver Guys ads. He does pavers..... as far as I can tell, that all he does. So I gave him a call.

Fast forward about a week, the colored stone he recommended was delivered to our home and the next day work began. They started around 8 am and we're done by 2 pm. 250 square feet of herringbone pattern stones were perfectly installed to replace an ugly, useless space.  They had moved all the old rock, all  the old bushes (I actually had worried they  might say that tearing out and hauling away the old vegetation was not covered  in the bid. That did not happen.) leveled the ground, put in a sand base, then cut and layed the tile as efficiently and nicely as it could have been done. The result: 100% satisfaction.

"I leased a vehicle in 2011 and my lease ends in October 2014. Since April 2014, I have received at least 6 calls from various employees like Allen (twice) and the most recent from Harold, who refused to give me his last name, like he doesn't trust what I'll do with that info, but I should trust him as a salesman. I told Allen in April that I do not want any more sales calls from their dealership until he has a specific model vehicle on the floor ready for me to come look at. Since then, my request has been ignored and I continue to receive calls from rookie salesmen who have no clue that I've not only already spoken with a rep, but made a formal request with Allen to not be contacted anymore until the vehicle is ready.

"My father-in-law bought a Groupon deal for him and my husband at the Gene Woods Racing Experience. We were there on Saturday, March 8, 2014.

The venue seems really nice. Super close to the airport. You can see the airplanes landing from the parking lot. The rumble of their jets is hard to ignore.

There was an MMA tournament or something going on, so we didn't go inside the large recreational building nearby, not even to use the restroom or hit up the snack bar like my mother-in-law wanted to. It was too chaotic and packed with hyped up kids. I'm not even sure if there was a public restroom near the racing facility.

As a spectator, though, you are allowed to go through the tunnel entrance with racers. Eventually you can sit in the shaded area where the karts take off. It's fenced in so you can rest a little easier about little ones being more safe.

So onto the go-kart race...

The guys had to watch a video before they jumped in their karts. A sock hat (sorry, don't know what else to call it) and a helmet were the only pieces of gear provided. Then the guys picked a car, first come, first serve basis. 

A guy got on the PA system to say a few final rules. I am glad the drivers could hear because I missed some of it.

A young kid was just about to leave to line up when he flipped up his visor in front of a worker and tried to wave the worker over; however, the guy just motioned the kid to continue lining up for a practice lap. I sensed right away that maybe the kid wasn't comfortable or something was wrong with his seat. It was odd that the worker didn't catch this, but the kid also didn't look comfortable. He seemed apprehensive about racing.

Eventually my husband ended up a couple cars behind the kid during the practice lap when out of no where the lone female driver (it was hard not to miss her, I'm not being sexist) crashed into the kid mentioned above. She was such an idiot driver and hit the kid so hard that he flew out of his go-kart. It was insane! My husband witnessed the whole thing and tried to get out to help the kid where they were clear on the other side of the track, but his kart kept taking off. Then when the workers rushed out to the kid with their walkie talkies, my husband tried to explain to the workers that the girl was being careless and unsafe. 

I am sure it was a case that if the workers didn't see it, they wouldn't take some random racer's word for it, but we saw it too partially - what we could with the columns of the overhang being somewhat in the way of our visibility.

The poor kid was dumbfounded and seemed panicked at first. Then he seemed really bummed because for some reason they made him get off the track. My husband told me that he had a bit of road rash. It was clear that his seat belt or something was giving him fits and that girl was in the wrong, but no one caught it when it happened.   

When the race was all over, we watched all the drivers exit their karts. The girl was just laughing and having a good time. That's funny because all the other dads and sons seemed a little concerned about the incident and\/or hot and tired from the hot Las Vegas sun and the effort it took to turn those little babies.

After this incident, the workers were much more aware, but it would have been nice to see this from the get-go. I feel like the girl deserved a black flag - do they do that in just for fun go-kart racing? If I raced, I would have said something at least to the guy at the check-in desk. It's hard not to race even when you're 4 months pregnant.

Had this incident not happened the way that it did, I'd be more inclined to give a 5-star review. It's not racing for money, but safety should always be first. I don't care how old you are. 

I do still recommend this place for kids and parents, though, as long as they are 54"" or taller. It's more difficult than it looks if you really are trying to smoke your buddy at racing. ;) The guys both liked the track. They had fun. It was a lot cheaper with the Groupon deal, though. Parents, please explain to your children to really SPEAK UP if something is wrong or doesn't feel right. And let them race because they want to.

"This is truly a shining star in Las Vegas.  Off the beaten path, this restaurant will offer its diners a superb culinary experience.  The wine choices are extensive and ridiculously reasonable, even the high end wines.  The menu offers traditional, as well as, modern conceptions with French-flair; all of which are brilliantly executed.   There is limited seating, both inside and out, so be sure to make a reservation through yelp.  We will definitely be back to dine again.",1.0

"Delicious! 

Very cute and trendy spot. Menu is simple which made it even harder to make a choice. EVERYTHING sounded delicious! I ended up getting the French dip style roast beef sandwich. It was very good, I loved fried onions on it they made a welcome addition to the sandwich. It could have used a tad bit more of horseradish on it but overall it was good. My friend had ordered the burger and I was able to snag a bite... It was to die for. So good. The bacon added just the right amount of smoke to the burger without over powering the burger itself. We also ordered a couple of the signature drinks which were good as well. 

The only drawback I can say was the price it's a little on the pricey side for a burger or sandwich which side choices are coleslaw or potato salad. But regardless of the price I will definitely be back! I'm already craving a burger.

"I really like Sygn, and I have enjoyed visiting for Friday night drinks and for a quiet Tuesday dinner and cocktail night with fellow Yelpers. It has a convenient location tucked away in the West End (although I find the street a bit dirty and dodgy, although perfectly safe). Based on its location, it has West End cocktail prices but I love the extensive menu of a huge variety of interesting cocktails - some were quite ordinary but others were really delicious, interesting, and beautifully presented. The mocktails were definitely overpriced, which is really a shame, though.

As for food, they brough around delicious samples of their pizza the first time I was there. The next time I was back I opted for the steak and cheese burger, which was delicious on a brioche bun. I thought the skinny fries didn't blow me away and could have been much better, but I really did like the burger.

I was split between giving Sygn three stars or four, but what made me choose to be generous was that I really like the decor inside. It is really interesting and fun, including their great window decorations with bottles and their ornate ceiling. It's a fun place to go, and I enjoyed being back tonight.",1.0

Eggs, specials, and baked goods are solid.  Never greasy, never stale, always on.  Can't recommend any one dish over another.  It's all solid breakfast food, slightly up market, but by no means pretentious.  Staff at times appear to be either untrained or nonchalant.  Or both.

First, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. 

We also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. 

I had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. 

Mon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. 

We were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip. However, it was pricey enough to expect better food than we got.

"There's so many things to love about all the Great Danes. The size, style, beers and menus. I want to make this place work, want to love the food and service I keep giving another chance but now I'm done. All my general comments refer to visits at the Cottage Grove location on Jupiter as well as this one in Fitchburg.

First of all, clean the bathrooms. I don't want to feel like I'm at a campground latrine. I've gone when it's not busy and watched the hostess, bartenders, servers and managers having a bit of downtime, and yet the bathrooms aren't touched for hours at a time. Once at the Cottage Grove location I pointed this out to the bartender, that it's dead and workers aren't busy and the bathroom has been dirty for hours. His response, ""There's an outside service we hire to clean up every night after close.... It's not as if this is like any fast food restaurant that has a schedule for checking the bathrooms periodically throughout the night."" He said this with a straight face, with no awareness that he was actually making a case that Taco Bell has higher standards. Anyways I've never seen a clean bathroom. What other hygiene shortcuts are being taken where the customers can't see them?

Service at the bar. Once my beer seemed flatter and a bit cloudier than I wanted. Maybe my expectations were wrong for that beer? I asked the bartender. He agreed that the lager I was drinking should be more fizzy and clear, and explained that if it's from the end of an old barrel, the last pull could come out like that. I told him I ordered that style because I wanted a beer that was light, clear and crisp. He nodded in agreement, then left me hanging. Basically, letting me know, ""sorry the beer we served you was old, stale and flat. Too bad so sad. Ciao."" Great job!

I've always found the server staff to be excellent. Not always perfect. At my last visit in Fburg my server had that annoying habit of squatting down to get at eye level with us. Would you like to slide into our booth and spoon a bit, too? Sorry, we ain't cool like that. Stand up and do your JOB.

The menu looks amazing but he food rarely lives up. A few positive points first. The pilsner cheddar sauce on the Black and Tan burger is representative of what this place is all about: upgraded pub food with their unique twist. Bratwurst is good. When hot the pub fries are very simple but excellent. The produce for their salads is really fresh, and the recipes for their salads have well balanced flavors and are surprisingly satisfying.

One of my favorite things about their menu is that you can order smaller bargain plates if the usual dinner is just too big. It's called the Pub Picnic section and you can get half of any sandwich with a couple small sides for $10 or less, for example, and other nicely sized listings.

Now the bad...

RED ALERT: AVOID THE SHREDDED PORK AT ALL COSTS. This is not the tender, juicy, flavorful carnitas you're hoping for. I have no reason to doubt that it is derived from some sort of swine species. All the fat, flavor, juice and anything 'pork' about it is processed and cooked out of it, leaving tough dry, fibrous, meat-like threads soaked with water and then whatever mediocre bbq sauce.

I asked for my burger to be medium rare it came out blood raw. For the rest of the day I couldn't shake the memory of that mushy, raw meat mouth feel. The fries on that plate were cold. The restaurant was dead at that time and every time the kitchen door swung open there appeared to be no shortage of kitchen staff.

The ahi is grocery-store-sushi grade fish, bland and limp, with an overly thick and powerful crust and a sear that goes way too deep. 

One of the big problems I've consistently have no matter when I visit either location is getting all the food out in an orderly fashion, all ingredients fresh and hot. For example, it could take a long time to get an appetizer and then moments later out comes the entrees. Or the entrees don't come out all together. Or one food item will have signs that it was prepared long ago (burnt, cold, microwaved, etc) while another item on the same plate will be too hot to eat.

I always enter optimistic and hopeful. I'm not overly picky or looking for a fight. I just want a clean environment, good service and good food. Again, servers: great job; bartenders hit or miss; managers alternate between running around putting out fires or standing around looking lost. The kitchen is a disaster.

One final good note: management is always very responsive and willing to own the issues and make an offer to satisfy disappointed customers. I don't want to get comped items or coupons for a next visit, I just want things to go right. Any establishment can have a bad day and one of my pet peeves is encountering service staff or managers that are more concerned about going into cya mode or blaming others. In this respect they do a great job.

"I stumbled upon this place with my boyfriend as we were driving up Central Avenue looking for a place for brunch. It's perfect if you're looking for a relaxing, tasty experience that won't be expensive. They serve sandwiches for breakfast and lunch with fantastic side dishes. My favorite sandwich is the one with ham, brie, apricot jam, and almonds! I have been back multiple times and I have never had something I did not like. The absolute best thing there is the kale salad, which seems crazy I know, but they dress it up so well that the kale is soft and sweet. I could eat multiple bowls of it in one sitting (this coming from someone who despises kale in most settings.) The owner always comes to check on how we liked everything and sometimes brings us the sandwiches when they're ready. They have a nice patio with outdoor seating and the front of the store opens up so everyone can enjoy the morning breeze. Overall this place consistently provides delicious food and awesome service!",1.0

"My ultimate favorite coffee shop! REAL coffee, none of that watered down starbucks stuff and i'm not a starbucks snob at all, this place is just better..in almost every aspect haha. I'm not even really an avid  coffee drinker but their coffee actually has a delicious, rich flavor and even gives me the caffeine I need (gives me a better boost than 5 hour energy). You can also pick up a bag of their mothership coffee for home :)
My favorite to get is their iced truffle berry. It's raspberry chocolate flavored coffee and wow it's just soo addicting! I also enjoy their smore, butter beer (sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing), white mocha, mint mocha, caramel, creme brulee and well, I guess all of their flavors haha! Everything I've tried has been great including their nomnom and alien burrito! I'm not vegan or vegetarian but those burritos were soo good that I don't feel like I'm missing out on any meat. They also have a great selection of teas and pastries. 
The prices are great as well! My large iced truffle berry is under $5 and they also offer a ""happy hour"", I have to double check what time it starts though, sorry! All of the workers are really friendly, and 95% of the time has been pretty fast. The inside is very cozy, and they also have a little outdoor seating area. Sometimes it's hard to find a spot because a lot of people like to bring their laptops and work but it's always nice just to to-go and have a picnic across the street at sunset park.

"I say don't be fooled by the area that this restaurant in, because in this case, looks can really be deceiving. 

You wouldn't think a nice restaurant would exist in the area this place is in. The outside looks like it's a subpar restaurant, but when you walk in, you'll be surprised, or at least I was. 

The menu has a vast selection of Thai dishes to choose from. I was slightly bit overwhelmed, but I wanted curry, and they have a dedicated section for curry. A few seem like the same but under a different name, but I'm not very experienced with Thai food. 

I ordered the musaman curry and I admit it was tasty. I could taste the coconut and it blended really well, especially when topped on white rice. The meat reminded me of Vietnamese beef stew and it was quite delicious. It came with a few pieces of potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots. I wasn't very impressed with the amount of food I was given and my table was given. We all were surprised at the amount of food we were given with the amount the food is. The $12 curry had the portion size of something $8, but I guess when it comes to quality, you can't argue right? I wouldn't mind coming back, but this wouldn't be my first choice for Thai food",1.0
"The one one was located at New Kennedy Square but they closed for awhile and I didn't know what happened to it because sometimes I do crave for wonton noodles and there really isn't that many options in the area...

So after reading Jennifer K. review (Thanks Jen!!) I recently found out that they relocated to across the street from New Kennedy Square..The South Unionville Mall with the T&T and etc..

I found that after a year (I think!) that they closed and reopening here, the quality has somewhat enhanced. The restaurant is definnetely smaller than the old location..so expect to wait for a table during weekend...

This is a place for quick eat, not for you to spend a long time deciding what to eat and etc...The wonton pieces are big and they don't cheat your dollar because it actually has shrimp and pork inside it..not like places where it claims to be shrimp wonton and you figured afterwards your order comes, it's not as claimed...

It's clean yet not spacious...$5.50 for a bowl of noodles, beef brisket is ok...ordered 1 wonton and dumpling noodle, beef brisket and a plate of veggies..all ended up being $20 (tax and tip in)

"Want to go to a dive bar in Pittsburgh? Gooski's is the place for you! This quickly became my go-to place after the first time I visited.

And when I finally got there I couldn't find where to slip my card in. Ironically, I love the feel of this place. It's a dark neighborhood dive bar, cheap drinks with cool bartenders, cool Polish Hill residents with no hangups about superficiality. The bar is also equipped with a good juke box, ping pong and pool tables, and a stage in the back for pretty good live music. It's pretty smokey inside, so beware if that's not your thing. The food is actually pretty good too. Overall, I love this place and am usually there about once a week.",1.0

First time I heard of this place I thought.. Hawaiian Mexican fusion that's freakin awesome! I was pretty intrigued because I do enjoy both of these ethnic foods. & the pictures made my mouth water. 

It pretty much has a Chipotle feel to it. I got a chicken bowl w\/ seaweed rice, mango roasted corn, tomato grilled maui onions and a ton load of lettuce. Although I did enjoy the meal I didn't give it more stars because after the meal I didn't feel like I wanted to come back right away.

"After I discovered some of the people in my group did not want to eat all weekend (that's another story but apparently it had to do with looking skinny in a bikini which I didn't care about), I found a new friend who wanted to eat and we booked for this place.  It's kind of open dining where you can see Aria from the interior.  A new concept I think that is happening with new restaurants at new hotels.

I did make an open table reservation and I was the one who was late (but I called). The table was ready right away.

- Tuna Tartare cones:  Comes with 3 cones.  It was okay.  I didn't think it tasted anything more than tuna in cones.  
- White Ceviche:  Mostly fish.  It was okay.. served with some sort of fried chips
- Paella:  Got the seafood one with lobster.. expensive.. about 40 but it was DELICIOUS.  Probably the best paella I've had in a long time... or maybe it was good because I hadn't eaten in a while.

"Sidenote- I was in town for a bachelorette party ( I grew up in Cleveland) 

This place gets to be a bit ridiculous. I get that things are for ""personal"" use... but for the ridiculous price they cost, they should work. We bought $150 worth of merchandise for a bachelorette party. One of the things was a pack of penis balloons for $9. When we opened them and tried blowing them up for a game, they wouldn't blow up, and the one or two that did either exploded or just looked like a ball, it wouldn't fill out to look like a penis. And when they blew up you could tell from all the white lines and ""stars"" that they were really old balloons. So my sister called them to ask if she could return them because they were defective... and the response was she could have a 25% off coupon that doesn't expire. Gee...thanks... That really solved the problem of the defective product. I could understand if I bought something personal and tried it out and didn't like it... but i bought $9 worth of balloons that ruined our game. I will never go here again for the mere fact that you don't reimburse defective products, regardless of the price.

However, I will say, the staff was very fun and made us laugh! That was the ONLY positive experience about this over priced place...",1.0
"It's actually pretty good for how inexpensive the prices were. Although they do not have a large menu, they had a good range of selections. Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.

After eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.

There weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world.

"Scam! I am an unemployed RN.  I spent almost 2 months pondering over whether I should spend over 4000.00 on 3 days of classes just to learn how to inject botox and fillers. Also i was mostly concerned with the ability to get a job afterwards.  I was promised by employees at National Laser Institute that the j  ob availability for this type of work was usually requested at NLI  by employers seeking people with experience, and that there was "" a demand for RN's with botox and filler knowledge"" and that there were""  a LOT of requests available at NLI and i would.not be dissapointed.""

I was overall dissapointed with the way classes were given and the lies i was told to get me in the classes. I also took this course with a plastic surgeon and he seemed to be more knowledgable then the RN traing us. He was actually educating them. I think i learned more from the MD student then the classes i paid so much money for. Another problem is all the info they give you is verbal.

Last night was my first month back after a one month hiatus. The studio was packed like a can of sardines, there was almost nowhere to lay the mat down, I don't know if it's because of the New Years resolution goals that people set for themselves or because of the groupon deals that they have been advertising. 

The class itself was very different than what I'm used to, it was not challenging and too slow for my liking. Normally I break a sweat and go right for my water bottle, last night I did neither.

The food is fresh, well prepared and pretty to look at on the plate, portions are huge, the atmosphere is low-key\/casual, the staff are friendly and welcoming -- especially the owner, and best of all it's cheap ($4 for 3 eggs, potatoes and toast!!!). They care and it shows.

I made a mistake in trying somewhere new for breakfast yesterday and instantly regretted it. I'll be back Figs!!!",1.0

"Over the holidays, all the buffets on the strip were charging up the a$$ for their ""holiday buffets."" In addition to the super expensive meals, the lines were all insanely long. As much as I love Bacchanal, there was no way i was going to spend 3+ hrs of my vacation time waiting in line to eat.

My family and I stopped by Studio B at the M hotel at the recommendation of some of our friends who live in the area. HOLY CRAP. THE FOOD WAS GREAT.  I'm so glad that we did. For just $40 per person we were able to enjoy their amazing seafood buffet. They offer so many types of seafood: crab legs, oysters, shrimp, etc. I really loved their prime rib. It was seriously some of the best I've had in Vegas. It  is perfectly roasted to a medium rare and super tender. I think I had 3 slabs of the stuff!

Booze is also included at Studio B. It's not the best beer and wine, but it is free :) 

The best part: I only waited about 15 min before I was seated :) 

It's unfortunate that the M Hotel is so far from the strip, but it does make Studio B the perfect stop for Californians coming in and out of Las Vegas!",1.0

"I'm only giving one start because there is no option for zero stars.  When I started at Physix I was in a position where I could afford the high monthly costs but a few months later my unforseen debt was racking up and I was having a hard time paying my bills.  I called and talked to the owned about the hard time I was going through and she didn't care.  She kept talking about my commitment.  I believe that I had a more important commitment....paying my MORTGAGE.  And yes, the membership is expensive, I shouldn't have done it in the first place.  I am looking at filing bankruptcy and they still don't care.  So by all means, sign up with Physix.  They REALLY care about people and their well being.....NOT!!!   They just want your $200 per month and don't care about their clients or what's going on in their life.  I told Shannon, the owner I was having a hard time paying my bills and unforeseen debt that accumulated and she only talked about her contract.  What really matters to Physix?!",1.0
"I was craving some chow mein so I decided to stop here while I waited for my flight.  The noodles were just ok. I ordered the vegetable chow mein. The vegetables were very fresh and crunchy and the noodles were tender and not mushy. The flavors are not real heavy so I did add a touch of soy sauce but not much at all. The portion size was pretty large too. The price was about right and actually fairly inexpensive for ""airport"" prices. It came to just around $10 with tax.

My complaint would be that the noodles had a very greasy texture to them. Not like a hole in the wall type joint but like ""I used too much vegetable oil to stir fry this"" type feel.",1.0

"Buyers beware.

I had a similar experience to the other reviewer here on Yelp and I would like to share my final feelings about this transaction so that others may be well informed.

I also found the price for these 'natural' mattresses to be exceptional and thought this was because of the online\/wholesale purchase. Now I'm not so sure.

Before I purchased the mattress I called the company (George) and was told that I could have a mattress density split (top med, bottom med-firm) for an extra fee.
I asked and was told I would be getting an official certificate of traceability to prove the mattress was organic rubber.
I asked and was told I was getting the wool topper as pictured in the online ad.

After the order was confirmed and I paid for everything I also had to call many times to get my mattress sent. It did eventually arrive after months.

The mattress density split I requested and paid for was not delivered. I received a single density mattress with no wool topper and a little card that Naturessleep created which was supposed to show the mattress authenticity (it did not). There is no inspection company or tracing numbers anywhere so I am very suspect about what kind of foam is in this mattress.

I called and asked for the proper mattress to be sent.
I asked for a proper tracing certificate.
I asked for a proper invoice from Naturessleep so I had something showing that I bought the mattress and showing the warranty I was promised.

I called many times and was promised many things including finally that the new mattress was sitting on their dock waiting for fedex to pick it up. After 3 months I finally gave up and told Naturessleep I was not happy with anything to do with the transaction and that they could take the mattress back.
I no longer had any trust in them (and by them I mean one person who seems to be 'the company' ) 

This is much longer than I intended but after such a frustrating ordeal I am hoping I will help others who are considering going down this path.
It may be that they have authentic product but given the service I received (or didn't I suppose) and the stories I was told over and over again I highly doubt it.
I would gladly spend $700 more and go to a local bricks and mortar business to make this kind of purchase next time. I would advise others to do the same.",1.0
"You'll find great steaks here at a moderate price. I loved the rolls and honey butter. Service was very attentive and friendly. But don't go here if you want to talk.

"Only got my gel nails (from elsewhere) removed, but this place is a gem. 

Facilities: Super clean, evidenced by both the spotless facilities (e.g. counter top), but also by the fact that they opened up both the buff and file, brand new, in front of me. These were both also offered to me to take home at the end of the appointment (this implied that they would be throwing these out afterwards). As others have said, this place is a little tight on space, but the seats are comfy and there's enough room to put your purse down. I also found out they always have some rom-com playing on their LCD screen, so you can get some movie therapy whilst getting your nails done. 

Service: Service seems to depend on who you get. I was placed with Diana, who didn't pressure me to chat, and just did her thing. I have to commend her on her very detail-oriented attitude, and will surely go back for shellac or gel service with her to see if my review will remain 4 stars.

Overall: Very satisfied with the service and the facilities! Will return to get one of the more ""regular"" services. 

Note for people considering this place: Please don't dress like a slob when you go here, since the others who come here work in the financial district, and will be decked out in their stylish, expensive shoes and purses.

"I do not want to under rate by putting too few stars, but if I were going to, I would give a single star.  When I first started ordering here we always had our pizza on time or in less time than stated.  The one previous time they lost my order they gave it to us for free due to the inconvenience.

Lately the phone service has suffered and pizzas getting later and later.  Last time I ordered they called me an hour later and said they had lost my order again.  They were going to give a 10% discount.  I called back a few minutes later and said to skip it in disgust.

"I grew up in this neighborhood and Golden Gate Chinese was one of the first places I ever ate Chinese food that wasn't La Choy canned chow mein.  I am happy to see that after all these years it is still going strong.  

This restaurant makes standard Chinese food - sweet and sour pork, moo goo gai pan, etc. not any sort of new Thai or fusion or other unusual new stuff, which for me is frankly a relief.  I am willing to give them four stars just because they make a decent pressed duck which seems to be unavailable at 90 percent of the Chinese restaurants I've been to in four different states.  Golden China also makes a lot of its food, such as dumplings, egg rolls, ribs etc.  fresh on site and the difference from most other Chinese places is noticeable.  I know of a few spotty experiences over the years where something wasn't made quite right or wasn't fresh as expected (for example - they usually make the sweet sauce homemade but a couple of times they must have run out or something because we got packaged sauce with the order), but I have heard many more tales of people who drive all the way from Avon to get dumplings here. They had a fire last Christmas but have bounced back nicely. 

The sauces do tend a little towards the bland unless you order a dish specifically advertised as ""Hot"".  I still think they're very good though, and would rather have it bland than loaded with onions like I get at some other joints.

I can't comment on the wait service as we almost always get takeout to go, but the folks who provide the takeout are always friendly and helpful, and the dining room is a pleasant place for the couple of times we did eat in.  You do need to ask if you want extra condiments - they give you very little otherwise, not like some places that throw a whole fistful of soy sauce packs in. 

With the huge number of trendy restaurants in Lakewood, it's nice to see a few old favorites like Golden Gate Chinese live long and prosper.  They will continue to be my Lakewood go-to place for takeout Chinese at a good low price. I think they do deliver as well, if you need that.",1.0
"This was a second visit for me. I t had been a few years and last time I had a pretty good round. This visit was a bit surprising for me. First, they claim same day reservations as they are the largest spa in the country or the world. When I walked up for a service to be schedule later in the day between 12 and 4 I was told that most of the massage types I was requisition were not available and then I found one and then he said it was booked while we were talking. So, I ended up with just a general massage which was fine and he did give me 20% off for my troubles. Now, that is not really a big deal as this is an easy discount to get but I appreciated the effort. I think this was more of a staffing issue than anything else with the availability. 

When I got there ahead of time it took them quite a while to get me back so I had almost zero time to spend in the steam room and sauna. What I noticed that was different this time was that the massage rooms seemed to be almost like a cheap row of motel rooms. The massage was nothing stellar, just run of the mill. This is where the biggest disappointment would occur.

I left my key ten miles back in the room. Now, I do not think there is any way you could remember which room you had been in. If there was, I never saw it. I asked the locker room attendant if he could help. He looked for my intake form and could not find it. Then, he just pawns it off on another employee who was very irritated to be bothered. Finally, when he found the slip which has been misfiled because the guy wrote hi T like an L or something he walked over to my locker and opened it and then just walked off. Now, this gave me no opportunity to shower or anything without leaving my locker open. Very poor service and frankly unacceptable. I will not likely return when in Vegas. 

I did want to bring this to a manager's attention on my way out but they had one person working the desk and a line of three folks and i had a dinner reservation to get to and now have to get to my room to shower.",1.0
"I'm sure everyone has heard the ""never go to the dealer for service"" mantra before, and that's sound advice in general.  However, Berge Mazda has been the exception to the rule in my experience.  I bought my 2010 Mazda3 from Earnhardt just prior to them ripping the Mazda signs off their buildings and More Mazda becoming the new dealer in Tempe.  I've never had a worse service experience than I have had at More Mazda.  They pretended that issues that I found were not there and simply refused to correct them.  After my interactions there, I knew I couldn't go back there for service.

I've had my 2010 for 4 years now, and have had some maintenance work and warranty work done at Berge.  Vince in their service department is friendly, knowledgeable and seems to actually care about his customers.  I noticed this morning that my car's dash began to separate.  The Phoenix heat must have done a number it.  Despite cracking my windows and putting up a visor, the glue in the dash lost its adhesive power.  Even though my car is well out of warranty, I brought it in on a whim to see if there happens to be a common issue with the dash that would allow them to still repair it.  No, it's not a warranty part for my car, but that didn't stop Vince from replacing my entire dash at no charge.

Now in all caps: THEY REPLACED MY ENTIRE DASH THAT WAS NOT UNDER WARRANTY FOR NO CHARGE!

They didn't even bother trying to repair it which I think would have been a more than acceptable alternative.  I now have a new dash panel for no other reason than the fact that I'm a repeat customer there.  The new dash also came with two bonus features.  The first is that it appears to have eliminated a pesky rattle near the driver's side air vent that was part of the dash that could not be repaired under warranty since rattles are only covered for about 10,000 miles.  The second is the new car smell returning due to the new piece.  It may not last long, but it's pretty cool to have that in my four year old car.

I arrived at 6pm for my reservation for 4 people this evening. In addition to us at this time, there were two other parties of 2 inside the restaurant (4 in total). Our server took our order, repeated everything back to us before leaving - one steamwhistle to drink, and to eat: falafel salad, cauliflower, kefta, snapper and shrimp entrees to share.

By the time our salad came out, the beer still had not arrived as I watched the bar staff - they had clearly not gotten the order so I reminded our waiter of the drink. Halfway through our appetizer, we wanted a second beer and as our waiter walked by, we tried to grab his attention - my father tried to give a friendly and obvious call (because he is loud) but I felt it was ignored to the point that the manager on duty had to come address our request.

When we finished our salad, I thought that the cauliflower would be next, or that it would come with the entrees because it was a hot mezze...... that never made it to our table. The mains came and the food did not disappoint. Everything was flavourful, tickling all my tastebuds and the spreads gave variety with each bite. But the service was extremely disappointing despite the fact that the restaurant was 3 \/ 4 empty when we sat down for our meals.

We sat at the the front round table by the open window and a party of two was seated right beside us.  Every time the waiter (same for our table and theirs) went to assist them, he would always come in between our tables while there was no one seated to their other side.

There are a number of picnic tables and benches, a couple close to the playground and some on the disc golf course. The play structures are covered (the large one anyway) and its surrounded by sand.

So, why the two stars? The playground equipment. I get it, parks departments are strapped for cash, just like everyone else, but on the big climbing structure there were, I believe, 4 gates chained up because of broken equipment (thus preventing kids from using it so they don't hurt themselves). While I do appreciate someone taking the time to put the gates there so kids won't fall out of random gaps in the equipment or cut themselves on a jagged slide, at what point do you scrap what's there and start over? Three of the four slides were unusable and the monkey bars were missing. It seems as if the children there were still having fun, but what was usable was very limited. 

I hope that this park has made a list somewhere for the city of Phoenix to fix up. I'd love to bring the kids back want to ensure they will be safe while playing.",1.0

"Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)

No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!

I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. 

I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. 
I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. 
My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)
My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. 
Last but not the least, Dessert. 

My food rating of each dish:
GREAT DISHES
*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. 
*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. 
*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!
*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!

GOOD DISHES
*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?
*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. 
*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. 
*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)
*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!
*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a ""Dacqoise"" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. 
*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. 

OKAY DISHES
*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. 
*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. 
*Creme Brûlée - not too sweet, yum. 
*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!

BAD DISHES
*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. 
*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. 
*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got ""Mint"" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream \/ gelato. 

Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. 

Service was good. 

Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. 

The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.

I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. 

The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol.

"After reading tons of good reviews for this company, I decided to give them a call. I had an old car with an engine that had just blown. When I read that this company did junk car towing I gave them a call. Mainly to see what the process was or if they pay for the old car or not. After a moment of tooth pulling he asked what was the make and model. After telling him he asked, and I quote ""what the hell is that?"". After a moment later of getting nowhere and a few more swear words - all of which came from him. I hung up. I called another company that had me setup and quoted a price within a few minutes.

"First off, I'd like to start by saying this gym is absolutely disgusting. I have been paying for membership for over a year. Supposedly there was construction, I only noticed new posters adding light to the pool area. The equipment is broken, and desperately needs to be cleaned. Wet AREAS are absolutely filthy. There's mold on the floor around the pool and the spa.  broken wood in the sauna on the wooden 
benches. In the stream room  a band-aid was on it on the floor. I can't remember the last time they cleaned it around 11 pm to steam disappear. The Spa has crustacean (gray matter) in it also has bubbles (spas aren't suppose to create bubbles) the Jets don't properly work. Swimming pool has not been drained & cleaned since I've had my membership. I thought Friday was the day to clean  the pool? Nope, that's the same water. Any maintenance people cleaning the pool? I have pictures up load  button where are you?  I am so disgusted at the failure of this gym. Usually the cleaning crew is watching Telemundo around 11 p.m. Every night or just watching TV period. Ladies locker room are not properly cleaned.  Poor sanitation I wouldn't be surprised if channel 13 took a sample of the water and found the swamp things DNA. Witnessed the cleaning crew with a hose but I do not see them with any  Sanitizing chemicals wiping down the wet room.  MRSA is real people!!! We don't deserve poor quality because of you budget cuts!!!! My life is on the line and I want a clean gym to work out in. No excuses super sport gets cleanliness and 24 hour get shafted? Our money is good so Please help this facility effectively immediately........... #failure #shameon24hr",1.0
"This place BLOWS!! 
We heard good things so we decided to try if out. We were greeted by incredibly load music which was not suitable for the small sit down dining venue. The service was horrible, our angry I-hate-my-job waitress did not explain the menus at all and probably could have mentioned that the chicken burger comes with a giant chicken leg, claws and all, sticking out of it. I ordered the Philly cheesesteak, I got chewy meat topped with 2 slices of processed cheese on a wonder bread hot dog bun. I asked to send it back and the waitress stormed off without even asking if I would like anything else to eat instead. If you want to have dinner having to yell your entire conversation to your partner and eat some pretty lousy food and get some horrible service then this is the place for you!",1.0
"STAY AWAY!
Lets first say I have never been so talked down to in my life. The people in that office are horrible and condescending. I have a frig. which was currently leaking on the floor in my kitchen when I called. They informed me the earliest they could come out would be tomorrow. I was in shock and stressed out. The lady was so very mean and told me 'well you need to call your HSA back"" which I did. When I called complete appliance back they first said the earliest they had was in 5 days!!! WAIT, so first it was in a day and now 5?! I asked her why it had changed and she was so very snippy and said ""well I was trying to be nice"". The tone of voice from Stephanie was so mean I started to cry over the phone. My home is flooded my husband can't be home for another 12 hours and these people are just downright mean. STAY FAR AWAY.

"Tried this place because it is open late and a friend told me about it.

The first time there we took a pizza and some rings and it was decent. The staff is ok but look like they are just there and cant wait for their shift to be over with.

Second time I actually took the time to look at the menu and noticed that it is loaded with so many different things and other than smoked meat they don't really specialize in just one thing. My friend had a smoked meat sandwich that he like but not the best he had. Another person at my table had a burger and she got something that looked like a frozen patty like you buy at Maxi. I took a place from the ""Table d'hote"" and the chicken brochette was ok a little over cooked for my taste and it comes with a salad that was just a regular salad you make at home nothing fancy. 

The worst part in this meal was the dessert (included) you have to choice rice pudding or jello. I took the rice pudding and I was able to only eat one bite this was the worst tasting rice pudding ever.

"I found Immediate Pools on another website and they had good reviews.  I got an estimate from Immediate and from one other company.  Immediate was slightly more, but their quote included better equipment and was   very detailed.  They did work with me a little on the price.  The work I had done was as follows:  Replace old plaster with mini pebble, replace tile with new tile, replace pool pump (replaced with variable speed pump), and replaced filter with a new cartridge filter.  They were very prompt, and it only took about a week for them to complete the job.  They always cleaned up the backyard daily and the pool looks fabulous.  They were also super friendly.

"I'm just starting to be in the market for a new car so i went to their website and saw a gorgeous car on an internet special from 29k down to 21k, so I schedule a test drive at 6pm, get there around 5:45 and my sales person isn't there, not a big deal because I'm early, right? Well they page him 3 times and doesn't answer so someone else comes over asking if we need help because they can't find our sales person in the building or by his cell phone, whatever, not a huge deal. We go to get the car and it's a manual, great, but the website says it's an automatic and i can't drive manual.  The new sales man says they have almost the same car but automatic, so he gets it, I drive it and it's a pretty nice car, he is texting the entire time we're driving and not really paying attention to me at all but that's fine I suppose, if he doesn't want to sell me a car that's his decision. We get back and he then tells me that this car is 32k, which is just a teensie bit different than 21k, I show him the website and he says ""oh, well that's a mistake and we need to take that down."" I then tell him what my budget is and he says ""well maybe you should consider a Kia."" So that is the 1st, and last time I'll be going to a Keffer dealership.",1.0
"So, me and the BF went to Sunset Grill this weekend. As my BF is a former server at restaurants he gets very ticked with poor customer service.

We had an older waitress with blonde hair and who took our orders and seemed quite cold. Didn't have a very friendly demeanor at all. I ordered the Super Breakfast (2 pancakes, 3 scrambled eggs, homefries and bacon) with a coffee.  My BF ordered something similar but he had no pancakes, sausage instead of bacon and toast instead with a hot chocolate. Our food came out in a timely manner which was great but we were given no utensils. 

As we kept a watchful eye for our server we were hoping that's where she ran off to but instead she got distracted doing something else. I even tried to look for cutlery to swipe so I can start eating but there wasn't any put on the tables. It's clearly given when the food is delivered. My BF was getting agitated b\/c no one likes to eat cold scrambled eggs so I decided to get up and just ask a random waitress for cutlery to which she replied ""Oh! You weren't given utensils for your meal?"" and then came by and dropped some off for us. I saw her mention it to our waitress and shortly after that the waitress who had no emotion poured me a fresh cup of coffee and asked how our meal was. She seemed pleasant then.

Our total came up to $25.  Not bad for two breakfasts. The food was good but it wasn't remarkable. The coffee was delicious. The restaurant itself was clean and I liked the decor.",1.0

After braving a 30 minute ride on the Dufferin bus my sister and I found ourselves standing along a long street filled with neon signs and wacky inflatable tube men. As we began to venture along the snow ridden sidewalks we happened upon the Le Chateau outlet. 
After entering we were both left in awe. The entire building was filled wall to wall with racks of shoes, clothes and jewelry. Excited we both split off in separate directions and began to scavenge through the store. Everything was separated by colour and item. Sweaters in one section, dresses in another, coats in another thus making it very easy to find anything we were looking for. After spending a good hour here my sister and I met up back at the front cash. Both struggling to hold the mounds of clothes we managed to find. 
After spending less then 150$ I left with a beautiful new trench coat, 2 new cocktail dresses, a new pair of kitten heels, a fur scarf and a pair of dress pants. 
The outlet was filled with great prices and great selections. However, the customer service was a little lack. When needed, it was particularly hard to find someone to help with reaching an item or finding a select size. 

If you're looking for great deals and a vast selection of clothes and shoes I highly recommend you stop by here. I can't wait to go back in the near future.",1.0
"After lunch, my husband and I were strolling through The Paris hotel with no plan in mind.  Happened across the Cafe Belle Madeleine and thought we'd check it out.  Always up for dessert, or chocolate rather, as we both are major sweet tooths.

Decided to go for the Chocolate Raspberry Mousse, which was a raspberry gelee incased in an airy chocolate mousse and decorated with what looked to be a handpainted chocolate disk, white chocolate cigars, and a raspberry.  It was very pretty to look at.

The taste, however, was just okay.  The raspberry gelee was very firm, and it was a texture I did not prefer.  The chocolate, of course, was delicious.  However, I feel this dessert was more flashy than anything, and we might have been better served to go with something more plain.  They did have quite a selection to pick from.

If I was local, I'd go here again just to sample something else.  They had sandwiches here as well, so it might be nice to get something quick, easy and less expensive than a lot of the other places we visited.",1.0

"This place charged me $60 up front to replace the soles on a pair of shoes. They ruined the shoes and would not refund me my money. JR said his employee messed up the shoes. The second time I went back he said he was going to repair the shoes.  The shoes looked worse after the second repair. JR gave me the shoes in a circle k bag the second time. The shoes are now two toned. One color on the top and the sides were a different color. The shoes were a solid color when I brought them in originally. I asked for my money back and he said no. He said he would repair them himself a 4th time. No discount was offered for the inconvenience.

"My hubby brought me here for a birthday cake based on high Yelp reviews.  Boy, were we misled.  I don't understand why it has such high reviews except that they give gigantic portions.  The philosophy must be: The food isn't good but you get lots of it so it must be great!  Woohoo!

First of all, the place is as French as the France portion of EPCOT center.  I mean look at the red berets the poor wait staff has to wear.  The food has french names but the execution is way too ham fisted.  Everything is American super size.  There is no finesse.  The staff were very nice and attentive though.

We ate the savory food first.  The rillette was store bought.  It was all right.  I can buy better at Whole Foods.  The french onion soup was good though and we had to bring some home because guess what?  The portion was gigantic.  The beef bourgouignon was inedible.  It came in a nice pot though and looked promising.  It was sour because they used bad wine.  They didn't cook the beef right and it was stringy and tough.  I did like the quiche.  The quiche was light and fluffy and we got to take some home.   

The black forest cake that we got was very pedestrian.  I can make it at home with store bought stuff.  But one slice was bigger than my kid's head.  :)",1.0

Went for Mother's Day with family and never made it to actually being seated. The sinister hostess grumbled at me to wait when I asked if I could be added to the wait list. She then stood there, doing nothing between seating others in line. After 15 min of waiting & other parties coming into the restaurant, I approached her again to add my name. She yelled ""You wait!"" She then lumbered to the front desk and yelled, ""okay, I get names now!"" 

Really? REALLY??

A crowd of about 20 people went forward to submit their names, but I got to her first (as I was there before the others) and asked for a table for 8.

"This place is a Noo No on my list. I will never go back..,,there are plenty of good places in Madison to try. 
To start: there was Mexican music playing which was off putting considering I was there for Italian 
Food. The bread appeared to have been pressed in a panini  grill and was pretty unimpressive. My dish featured the ""homemade"" sausage which was very tough and over cooked. The Tiramisu was flavorless and the wine was served in a glass that had dust all over the rim. For what you get.... The price of the food seems exorbitant.  I was confused about what the restaurant was about. There were tons of Mexican decorations and there were goldfish in a bowl at the hostess stand. 
There was a distinct smell in the Restaurant too..... It smelled like an old Bar.
My suggestion would be to improve the ambiance. Beef up the smells to make the place feel more Italian. Serve real fresh bread in a good quality Olive oil. Include at least a small side salad with an entree.",1.0

"The menu is hella limited but that's okay.  They have some excellent fries and the emerson burger is good.  The cheese in the emerson burger is too prominent though; it overpowers the flavor.  But if you're into blue cheese, you'll love it.  The prices were pretty high, but as I've said before, that's how you keep the freaks out.  This is Lansdowne and Bloor so those kind of tactics are essential.  The ambiance was nice there; it's good for a date.  Make sure you take a look at the menu before you go there. I'm not kidding, you might end up just ordering fries. They don't have things like gravy or chicken fingers.  I wish they had poutine but I guess that's too low brow. The only other thing that was kind of bad was the long wait for beverages and meals. Get the fries though. Seriously. FOUR STARS.",1.0

Purchased a groupon and made a reservation for a paint class for my parents and i.  My parents got sick so i contacted paint a holics to see if we can reschedule when they are better.

He acted as if he didn't remember after i resent him his emails stating he would honor the rebooking of a new class and there was NO expiration date on this code.  Then because he realized his mistake he said he will honor another paint class as long as i book from the october calendar.  I told him which class i wanted to reserve and asked if he can help me reserve it and he said the new code he made already expired...again!!!  are you kidding me??  lol.   Jason then says he will still honor it as long as i pay an extra $80!!!  You are really going to charge me more money after promising we can rebook another class due to my parents being ill??

"Do you know what a commercial casino is? If so go to the New Orleans.  I have played there with my wife many times because it is closer than the strip.

If you were to go a bit further you could drive to the strip and get the same results. Over priced, over done, comps are basically impossible to get as I played about  $350 and don't think the game moved at all for me.   If you were to play and get comps easier I would have been happy.

The following day friends offered to bring me dinner and the thing I craved more than anything else was an Oregano's Favorite Salad.  

My friends ordered take out and brought dinner to my home.  Much to my disappointment, instead of the amazing salad I usually enjoy when eating at the restaurant, I got a container of iceberg lettuce with a smaller container of shredded chicken.  NONE of the normal ingredients (other that then iceberg and the chicken) were on the salad.  It was awful, if the iceberg had been missing literally nothing else would have been in the container.  

Needless to say we were all very disgruntled, but given my post-surgery state, no one was able or wanted to drive all the way back to the location to get them replaced.  We all ordered the same salad and all received the same lackluster container of lettuce.  Sooooo disappointing - I will never again order take out from this restaurant.",1.0

"I don't know how to say this without feeling dirty, but I'm usually not much of a sausage girl. Thus I entered this establishment with slight hesitation. However I was pleasantly surprised not only by the diverse offerings, which included a number of vegan options, but also by the decor. It has a true Oktoberfest vibe meshed with cafeteria seating and a unique but practical ordering system. 

I opted for the turkey\/chicken with sautéed onions, sweet peppers and garlic aioli. Omg those sautéed onions were the bomb, a term I swear I don't use lightly. The bun was also stupidly good and the sausage itself was lean and tasty. This place is right up my alley: hormone free, no filler, only good stuff. A great option for people who like to know what they're eating.

"A broken heart is not unlike a broken bone in that you have no choice but to just bear the weight and discomfort of it until it eventually heals. It is in these times we turn to comfort food and for me it's ramen. To come in from the cold and mix my own tears with the ones induced by a delicious bowl of spicy ramen noodle soup is just what the heart doctor ordered, to which I happened upon the new Kinton Ramen location on Bloor in Korea Town. 

The first thing you'll notice about the restaurant is it's clean and crisp modern appearance followed quickly by the wave of high energy the place exudes. As a customer you are greeted by all staff in a boisterous greeting in Japanese the minute they lay eyes on you. The servers on high alert hang up your jacket and seat you as quickly as possible. From there you are given a menu to browse as the onslaught of what I assume is Tokyo Pop dance music attempts to drown out the walla-walla of your fellow customers. 

I ordered the miso based ramen with pork belly. From there I was given a glass of water in a cool metal cup, chopsticks and a wooden spoon which I appreciate over the plastic or porcelain that you usually get in Asian restaurants. The soup came hot and smelling delicious. I quickly dove in and found the ramen warming me, stimulating the pleasure centers of my brain long neglected. 

The staff always attentive checked in on me periodically to see if I was enjoying everything, which I was. By end meal I was informed that if I finished every last drop in the bowl they would give me a discount card towards free dumplings and plaster my face on their facebook wall. Well who was I to say no to brilliant market ideas. I was instructed to show off my empty bowl as they snapped a picture of me via an iPad. I looked at the picture, the ramen having eeked out a smile from me over the affects of a still broken heart. 

All in all a great high energy place with delicious ramen with friendly and attentive staff. A little too cacophonous for quiet intimate dining however. Kinton exudes lots of friendly energy with their food and that's just what I needed.",1.0
"Like a few recent reviews,  I've too been coming here for a long time, over 12 years. I've always let the small things slide, a bad server here and there. During my recent  visit my friends and I came in for a quick beer. I didn't have my wallet so I simply asked for water. The waitress very rudely asked me to leave. I questioned her about it, she simply coped out with ""it's upper management""
Upset, I emailed their management and they assured me this is not their policy. This was not the first time with bad service, just the worst and the one that will make me not return again.

"I've heard some praises about the newly opened David Clawson Restaurant in Sun City Anthem. So, when the husband and I were debating where to eat dinner I suggested we check it out. Thankfully, seating was available without a reservation on a Saturday night. We were led to a table right away. There is a certain elegance found in the warmth and simplicity of the space, I felt it immediately. The theme continues throughout the entire meal. The menu is straightforward, and the wine\/beer pairings are clearly shown. All without the fuss. It was rather refreshing. 

I've always believed that the best formula is to do a few things, and do them well. DCR really excels at this task. Sure, we had our favorites, but every plate we ordered was tasty and well executed. 

Everything sounded fantastic so we let our friendly server steer us in selecting our choices. The menu is built on small plates meant to be shared so we chose five items to start; The soup ($8), crab ($14), whitefish ($15), duck ($11), and veal ($9). The perfect end was the cheese ($8) and chocolate ($8). The backside of the menu shows the perfect pairing for each dish which may be wine, beer or cider. As much as we would've enjoyed a full pairing it wasn't in the cards for us, since the husband had to return to work. So, we settled on a Squatters Craft Beer ""off duty"" IPA and Tieton Wild Washington Apple Cider. Both were thoroughly enjoyed. 

An amuse bouche of salmon belly whet our appetite. Then, our meal began with the soup. It was too hot to handle, but once it cooled, we were able to enjoy the leak and potato broth seasoned with saffron and dotted with mussels. It was velvety and comforting. 

The whitefish was a lovely cut of seabass and tender bok choy swimming in a delicious bath of miso & kobayaki broth. Outstanding. Truly. The veal cheek was nicely done. I enjoyed it more than the one I recently had at Bazaar Meat. It was beautifully braised; and paired with the merlot? Stellar. The bits of mushrooms, bacon and kaboucha were not to be missed. 

The crab cake was very yummy and it would typically be a favorite, but we had already enjoyed the cheeks and the seabass. Both are tough acts to follow. The duck leg confit had great flavor with hints of citrus and the sweetness of honey. I really enjoyed the tart blueberries. The meat alone was tad dry. 

Our love affair with gouda began long ago, when we see it, we must have it so the cheese plate was a done deal. How does gouda get even better? Add truffles. Oh my goodness, we were in heaven. The housemade crackers and fig jam were great too, and I've had a long time weakness when it comes to marcona almonds, but that cheese? Yum. 

Lastly, I was unable to resist ending on a sweet note. I had to try the chocolate dessert. It too was wonderful. Rich, creamy, crunchy, sweet, but not too sweet. It was just right. As if that wasn't enough, with our check we were given the most delicious white chocolate and basil truffles. They really know how to leave a lasting impression. Bravo. 

When I suggested dinner at DCR, I had no idea we where in for such a treat. It was such a pleasant surprise. I'm ridiculously happy that it is in my neck of the woods. But let it be known, it is well worth traveling to the edge of the valley for this gem.",1.0

"This is a perfect date spot. Guys, follow my lead and get some points with your lady friends. A night at Dolcetto & Co guarantees good food, good drink, a comfy setting, AND you won't break the bank.*

Typically, as soon as someone says 'small plates,' my mind's left the conversation. Why in the world would I want to pay for a dinner plate of food and get back something that could be served on a saucer plate? How does that make sense? To whoever thought of this scam, sir, I tip my hat to thee. It wasn't until an experience at Dolcetto & Co that I realized that my disdain may stem from an American perspective. D&C may serve small plates but said plates are packed with flavor, surprisingly portioned and easily sharable for two. Not once did I contemplate stabbing her hand with my fork in order to make sure I got a taste. Did I say that out loud?

Because I'm worldly, I opted for a cocktail over wine: bourbon & apple juice. It sounds odd but I'd been turned on to this combo in Miami Beach and, surprisingly, it works. Well. For the two of us, we had five dishes: eggplant with fontina cheese, prosciutto & mushrooms (heavenly), rabbit porketta (surprised I liked it; usually I'm not a fan of rabbit but this was the second time in Montreal I had it and liked it), Italian sausage pizza, the garlic shrimp with tomatoes & pancetta (good but nothing you haven't had before), and the lobster\/fennell cannelloni (as decadent as you might imagine). The wood seating is tight for either a two top of a four top. I guess Montreal doesn't have the plus-sized population of the nation to its south. As much as I joke, I'm not a particularly large man and I had some difficulty navigating the space between tables. I imagine that for folks of a bit larger size, this could be an embarrassing issue.

"Great ambience but the food doesn't cut it.  The only thing that was pod was the free dinner rolls that were buttery and had sea salt on top to offset the sweetness.  

Got the $55 ribeye that came luke warm and under seasoned.  By far the worst ribeye I've ever had at a nice steakhouse.  It was full of fat too.

The risotto was horrible.  Sour like something we bad and it came with huge cherry tomatoes, very unrefined.

Short rib was delicious, highly recommended.  Scallops were just whatever and the carpaccio was good, savory and worth trying.

Service was excellent minus out main server.  He didn't do much but the other help was amazing.

Monkey bread was recommended so we tried it.  Very very very sweet, too sweet.  I y thing that was good was the banana ice cream but I wouldn't get this of you for like your deserts too sweet.

You can see the film first hand, feel the difference in Heat Reduction, and get educated before you decide.  Tint is very difficult, and can not be completely 100% perfect.  There is always margin for error, but I believe from all of my past experiences, Stewart performed at the TOP.  No Pressure from this guy, they are happy to install whatever you want.   I have waited about 2 weeks since my install to check out every aspect of the tint.  One of the biggest issues I have had with past installers, is that they don't clean the windows very good before installing the tint.  I waited 5 days after install, then washed the vehicle and did a good window cleaning inside and out.  CLEAR - No Smudges or Streaks between the film and Glass.  A+ ... After that experience, I decided to go back and have Brad take care of the full 3M paint protection film on my Ridgeline.  Brads install came out good.  I would say a solid 4 Star.",1.0
They have a good New Mexico breakfast burrito... I love their verde salsa! BUT.... It takes AWHILE for a simple burrito.

Here's a hint - order the soup. The waiter kind of downplayed the soup as being very simple. Well, it may look simple, but the flavors just exploded in a great way. When we told the waiter how much we loved it, he explained the ingredients and process of making - and it all made sense.",1.0

Got another Tom Kah soup to go since it was perfect as an appetizer, main course, dessert or whatever.  So very good.

Will go back for sure.  Atmosphere was very pleasant and soothing but stil casual. Only real complaint from me is the temperature.

Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. --  http:\/\/bit.ly\/1mfuMNf
Thin sliced sirloin with bell peppers and onions, topped with mac & cheese.
On paper, the Philly Mac & Cheese Steak sounds over the top delicious.  But overall it was really dry.  I think mine could've used a lot more cheese sauce.  That probably would've made it a lot better.  Nice try though!  The side of sweet potato tots were good though and I'm glad they threw in some honey mustard dipping sauce for it.

Service was really good here.  My waitress was really friendly and enthusiastic and always checked on me.  But then again, I was the only customer out on the patio at the time.  I could imagine things getting a little hectic later in the day and at night especially.  No complaints from me though, my server was awesome!

The decor is nice.  Red and black colors with velvet panels and curtains.  It definitely had a Frank Sinatra era feel.  Gorgeous red chandeliers and comfy plush chairs.

We ordered the chicken nachos. The marinated shredded chicken was delicious.  I like how they put the sour cream, guacamole and salsa on the side so it didn't make the chips soggy. They serve generous portions here for sure.  I had  the t-bone pork chop and my date had the seared beef medallions.  Both super delicious and the presentation was as if I was dining at a fancy restaurant on the strip! I was very surprised.  The side salad that came with the entree looked like an entree itself.  Big plate and the house salad was made of dark greens and not the typical romaine lettuce.  

We will definitely come back to check out the weekly poker tournament, the live entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays and definitely the food.

"My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3\/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2\/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2\/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3\/5.

"The hotel was actually better than I anticipated, especially for an older hotel and casino. We wanted to stay on the strip over 4th of July weekend and knew it would be crazy, but the Riviera averaged out to be in our price range for 4 nights. As the days went on (and got crowded) it was a little difficult being quite so far down the strip, as you have to spend a good 10 minutes walking just to be at the start of it all, but leveraging the monorail to the LVH helped a lot. And - it's not quite as far as the Stratosphere, it's pretty close to a Walgreen's which came in handy, and the first stop on your way up the strip is the Wynn Encore.

I enjoyed the casino and the waitresses were actually the friendliest we came across our entire trip! It has some old school Vegas charm and didn't feel too rowdy or crazy compared with some of the other casinos. The pool seemed nice and our room was better than expected. It was also very easy to get to from the lobby.

The rooms look as if they've been updated recently. The bed was very comfy and the flat screen TV over the bar area was nice. The clamp holding our showerhead was broken, but everything else was fine. There was a hair dryer and an iron\/ironing board in the room, which doesn't always come with a 3-star room. We had a lovely view of the parking structure (haha), but seriously, for the price and the fact that we checked in almost at midnight, it was expected.

"I had sent an email to laser for less after receiving a treatment that I was less then satisfied with. I have never been so impressed with the response I received, not only did the marketing director explain that they have a 14 day ""touch up"" policy (which I was unaware of), but she offered to do a complete re-laser of my chest and stomach area to rectify the issue, even though it had been well over a month since my last treatment. This is something I felt was clearly above and beyond for any business to do. Laser for less has made a lifetime customer out of me!",1.0
"This place has defined my drunk nights while I was in university. Their pizza is a wonderful thing.... even now when I return (not as drunk) I still enjoy some Al Taib.

They got an express location as well that serves faster - this is more the sit-down place.

"I would never use this moving company again.  I used them twice against my better judgment.  The first time I used them, several items were broken & a glass table top was missing.  Unfortunately, in the contract, you have to look over all your furniture before the movers leave to determine what was damaged (how can you prove it anyway... It's your word against theirs)... And who actually is going to look through every single item that was moved?  Chances are, you are exhausted from packing up.  I called the company the next day & the guy we spoke to said to write down everything that was damaged & he would talk to his guys about it & see if he could do anything.  Obviously, I already knew he would revert back to the contract so I didn't even waste my time.

The next move was 18 months later...I moved out of my rental into my new home & was on a time crunch.  I didn't have time to research another company, so I used them again.  This time, every piece of wood furniture had a major gash in it.  I had a brand new $1400 crib and the guys were moving so fast, I could hear the side railings banging against each other when the mover was rushing down the stairs.  Huge gash in it... Gash in my expensive wood tv console, gash in my table, gash in my dresser & hash in my bed frame...And I knew none of those gashes were there before the move.  Again, I just didn't have the time to put every piece of furniture under a microscope, especially with a newborn, before they left.  The movers would just deny it anyway. 

For example, I had a brand new stand up mirror and the moving guy comes out of my bedroom and says, 'I'm just letting you know this leg is broken on the mirror.'  It wasn't broken before he touched and I told him that.  He just said well I'm letting you know it was broken when I picked it up.  Ridiculous!  And we had a bookcase that totally fell apart from the way they moved it.  
An observation is that they rush & don't always wait for another mover to help them.  I would never ever use them again, not to mention, they are expensive!!!",1.0
"The treatments I had here were wonderful! I took my mom her for a post mothers days present, and she as well was very happy with the services. We got the Spa Me package which included a facial, a massage and a foot scrub. Everyone there was very friendly.

The facial was good. During the extractions I felt like there were a few that weren't quite ready to be popped that she really went at. As for my mom, a few hours after the massage her face got red and inflamed and for the next couple days her skin peeled, but she said after the dead skin peeled off her face looked and felt younger and healthier! She was VERY happy with the finished results. (shes also 56 and had never had a facial before so I'm sure her face was just really past due for a facial)

For our massages we both had the owner of the spa. She was REALLY good! We both prefer a firmer massage and her pressure was excellent. She had a natural instinct for finding knots and getting them out. She used many hot towels in the session which for me is a major plus!

The spa itself looked like an old dentist office or something that was turned into a spa. The rooms were a little bit on the small side, but I mean once you're in session it really doesn't matter. I'd rather be in a small room and has an amazing session than be in a large room with a not so great session. And she did a good job with making the rooms look cute.

All in all we were both very satisfied with this place. I would definitely come back here next time we visit!",1.0

"This is definitely one of my favorite bars in Madison. My girlfriend took me to a couple of bars and restaurants around the Capital building, and I enjoyed my time in the Great Dane the most out of any of them.

The atmosphere is very laid back during the weekdays, which is a nice change of pace from the nights filled with drunken stupor whilst stumbling around State Street with all of my fellow inebriated, tuition paying colleagues. 

They brew their own beers here, and I think that they are all fantastic. My personal favorites are the Devil Lakes Red Lager, Crop Circle Wheat (seems to be their best seller), and the Pecks Pilsner. 

I've never had the chance to eat at this place before, but they seem to get their cliental to frequently order food (most everyone in here was eating), and the other people looked like they frequented the Great Dane quite a bit (a lot of businessmen stop by here during their lunch hour for a beer and a sandwich it appears). 

My favorite thing about this place is how nice their ""bar games"" setup is. I'm the stereotypical jock that obnoxiously ALWAYS has to be winning and thinks everything is a competition. Because of this, I'm an atrocious bar games snob. If bar games were the equivalent to being addicted to crack cocaine, this place would be my drug dealer on speed dial (just go with it?).

For starters, the thing that keeps me and my arm candy coming back for more is the shuffleboard. Not too many places have a shuffleboard, let alone a nice one like they have. Second, they have two nice electronic dartboards. The dartboards are located where dartboards should be; in the corner where no one walks by. I've been to too many bars where I fear that I might accidentally throw a dart into someone's jugular because people are constantly walking in front of me during a throw, but not here. Every time that I've been to this watering hole, I have always seen the dart boards in use. Lastly, but certainly not least, their beloved pool tables. I'm almost certain The Great Dane Pub on E Doty has been voted ""The best place to shoot pool in Madison"" two years running - and for good reason. They have four, count em' FOUR, sweet pool tables. They are very classy tables, and to take it a step further, some of the nicest pool table setups I've seen in a public establishment. The felt stretching over them is clean and crisp, the balls always seem to be in top notch shape, and their pool cue are sweetness. It's no wonder that they are perpetually busy.

Free pool and shuffleboard after 9PM on Sunday's!! But if I'm in town, I better not see your face around these parts because I'll have to hustle you in shuffleboard.

Overall, this place is the cat's pajamas in my opinion. If you are looking for somewhere to have a beer or two while you take your buddies lunch money in a game of pool, shuffleboard, or darts; I would come here without a doubt.",1.0

"Let's put it this way--Shout House will NEVER be known for it's fine cuisine. That having been said, it was a great alternative to the otherwise overloaded restaurants that line Westgate because people weren't looking UP to the 2nd floor!

"I am not a big fan of popcorn typically but figured it was a good option for holiday snacks.

"I'm definitely a big fan!  Brooklyn Bowl has officially become my favorite venue in Las Vegas for concerts\/live music.

This is what The Joint used to be - before they got too big and impersonal.

It's a great layout.  You head up an escalator and are not overwhelmed by a big crowd, since the stage is in the back.  The first thing you see are beer pong tables, a bar and seating.  I love that there is seating - and plenty of it (not a ton, but way more than most venues).

I was here for the private event celebrating the announcement of the Life is Beautiful lineup.  I didn't get to see the opening act because I had to work until the show started, but I showed up just in time for the ""surprise guest-"" Girl Talk!  There was some confusion while trying to get in.  Since it was a private party, they had a table with laptops and the representatives checked to see if you were on the list.  My friend was invited because she purchased her tickets immediately after last year's festival and she arrived before me.  It didn't take a long time to get in, but it was bit unorganized.  Once I had my wristband, I was on my way and excited!

There was an hour wait at the restaurant (there is an actual restaurant inside - how cool is that?!), so we decided to just sit at the bar style seating against the window by the front bar and order from our waitress.

We shared the hummus ($9).  Pretty good - but I think it's pretty difficult to screw up hummus!  We also had ""The Beach,"" ($15) one of their French bread pizzas.  It had pulled pork and pickled peppers.  It was larger than I expected, and the pickled peppers were actually pretty spicy.  Overall good and we would order it again.

They have a decent drink menu and beer selection.  Although I found it funny that they had Green Flash Western IPA - it's actually called West Coast IPA. :) Of course they have quite a few beers from Broolyn Brewery.  The thing that could REALLY make this place amazing is if they could strike some sort of special deal with Yuengling to carry their beers there.  What's more East Coast than Yuengling?! Anyhow, that will never happen, but a girl can dream!

After eating we wandered towards the back. We passed a small area with couches and lounge chairs, which was really cool.  We also passed a patio with misters.  The venue is NON SMOKING, which is amazing.  It looked as if there was a 2nd patio upstairs for the VIP area as well.  Well done, BB.

Once we saw the stage, I could see the bowling lanes to the left as well.  I hope to go back and bowl during a show sometime soon - what an amazing experience that would be.  The bowlers all looked like they were having a blast.  It's too bad that the price to bowl is comparable to highway robbery. (Please take note BB, lower the prices!)

I love, love this place.  The sound was amazing, the floor and stage were small and it's by far the best place for an intimate show.  They've also done a great job of bringing in a variety of talent.  I am for sure going to Wu Tang in September - can't wait!

"Excess. Schtick. Zero f***s given. That basically sums up Heart Attack Grill.

On the doorstep of Fremont Street, Heart Attack Grill is everything you've heard and more. The scale out front, eating free if you're over 350lbs, the hospital theme, the spankings if you don't finish your meal. This is Vegas excess at its best and HAG knows it. They admit it. They will gladly take your cash (and it is cash only), thicken your arteries some more and laugh all the way to the bank while doing so. 

My friends and I stopped by after doing the SkyJump and were eager to fill our bellies after nearly emptying them several hundred feet in the air. We weighed ourselves for laughs, entered and got geared up in our hospital gowns and took a seat in the sparsely populated restaurant in the optimal pre-lunch rush time. We were seated quickly and given menus, which we flipped through while enjoying the culinary sideshow that HAG has made itself out to be. There isn't a large selection, although what they have comes in some very large sizes, the most infamous of which is their cheeseburger with eight half-pound patties and 40 slices of bacon.Vegetarian options? They openly mock this by calling their cigarettes this. Diet pop and light beer are blasphemy here as well. Our waitress\/nurse (nursetress?) was super friendly and sat down with us to give us the run down on the menu and how things worked there, especially that if we didn't finish our food we would be spanked with a paddle. And she would gladly do it. And many people over the course of our meal were; there must have been a dozen just when we were there that marched up to the centre of the restaurant, grabbed a hold of the contraption over which you bend over and are video taped on, and paddled...hard. The videos of your face while being spanked are posted on a website for all the viewing masses of the interwebs. Oh, and you can shell out several dollars to buy the paddle with which you were spanked as well, because why not? Another opportunity for HAG to take your money, you filthy animal. Despite knowing the paddling penalty, I made the unfortunate choice to get a side of onion rings in addition to my single burger, which I got chili and cheese on as well. 

It wasn't a long wait, but I wouldn't have known if it was anyway, with everything there is to look at here - the paddlings, the classic movie posters that have been changed to be food\/HAG related, the Jello shots being given via plastic penises and over-sized needles. On the wall above the counter, two projectors play clips of HAG making the news, giving the ultimate middle finger to their detractors. Remember those news stories about a couple of guys having heart attacks here? Those will play. Eat up, chubby. Overall, the atmosphere is like a frat, diner and hospital mashed together, but the energy is fun and contagious, as every swing of the paddle brings about cringes and cheers alike. 

When our food arrived, it was intimidating. My burger was a single but was still a hefty size and the onion rings were some of the biggest I've ever seen, not to mention that they filled their own basket. No skimpy side order of a few rings here.
The burger was one hell of a hot mess; the patty was a little on the dry side but the chili was plentiful and good, if not an amazing example. The onion rings started out good, but thick onion rings tend to be soggier anyway, and when you have a big basket to battle through to avoid getting your ass literally beaten, it got less than enjoyable pretty quickly. Luckily there was a bunch of ranch to help the soggy, greasy rings slide down my gullet until the very last one was gone. Having paddled both of my friends, one for not finishing and the other since it was his birthday, our waitress had been keeping a close eye on me as well, but luckily for me and her 
tired shoulder, I did finish my meal.

The food was pretty meh, but Heart Attack Grill is a damned fun spot. They're probably not even trying to have good food.

"One bad manicure experience knocked this rating down significantly. The only reason for 2 stars is the good facial and massage I got here, but those might not even matter after what I experienced getting my nails done. 

To begin with, I'm an east sider, so coming to Lakewood for a manicure is not something I really LOVE to do, but a friend's boyfriend got her a much needed spa day (which was greatly appreciated and this by no means is his fault). I suggested Revelations because I had a really good massage here in the past. Little did I know that's pretty much all you should come here for.

The spa day began really well with a facial (my first) that was really relaxing and the guy that did it was funny, nice, and made me feel comfortable despite feeling a little awkward (follow up: my skin did get slightly irritated after this, but that's not their fault at all--I have pretty irritable skin). The bad part came after the facials when we got manicures...

I had cut my own nails a couple of days before this because I just can't handle long nails--I apologized for them being nubby and hard to work with and my nail tech seemed OK with it. But then she ended up filing the skin off of the end of my fingers and slicing more than cuticles away. This resulted in SO MUCH peeling in the next couple of days after the mani. Then, when she was doing the base coat and first coat of polish, she walked away and had a whole conversation with someone about phones, called someone and ended up getting mixed up. She forgot which finger she was on--very unprofessional--and then told us about some lady who had ""massive legs that she couldn't lift when she was doing a pedicure."" Now, I'm not the most sensitive person in the world and sometimes I just share thoughts that could offend...but I'm also not insensitive. After she told that little story, I couldn't stop thinking about what horrible story she was going to get out of us for her next victim. As the polishing continued, she got more on my skin and fingers than I generally do when I'm doing my own nails and even painted a hair onto one nail. GAG. I basically had a hairy fingernail and pink cuticles (what was left of them). 

After it was all done, my friend's tech came back and ""cleaned up"" my nails, but at that point, there was no saving them. I guess the good part is that the polish started chipping and looking worse after a day, so it wasn't a long-lasting mess. It barely lasted two days before I was ready to re-paint them. 

As other reviewer Kristie B. said, the towels did look dirty, it was not relaxing, and I'm definitely convinced that the nail tech that did my nails was not professionally trained in any manner (heh...manners...). 

I'll never come back here for a mani\/pedi. And honestly, though the massage I had previously was amazing, I'm not sure I even feel like the drive and giving this salon\/spa my business is worth it.",1.0

"Habe es nochmal gewagt 3 Jahre später im Wittkoop einen Burger zu essen. Es waren gerademal 2 Tische belegt. Die restlichen Tische waren dreckig, aber die Bedienung hielt lieber einen Plausch, als die Tische sauber zu halten.

Came here on a whim while passing by and decided to give the Oreo Milk bubbletea with tapioca a try. Upon ordering, the waitress let me know it was buy one, get one free but seeing as I was by myself I politely declined the offer since I would just look like a damn pig walking down the streets of Yonge with 2 bubble tea's in my hand right? How selfish can I be? LOL

And to be honest, I waited quiiiiiiite a bit of time just for a SMALL.... I had a phone conversation for almost TEN MINUTES - I kid you not so let me say that again - TEN MINUTES! Like what the hell was this guy doing?! Using a toothpick to smash the oreo's!?! - and literally there were only 2 other tables who had customers already enjoying their treats while one was already on the way out so CAHM ONNNN!

I paid $5.65 for the small and as I was about to leave when I finally picked up my order after taking an hour nap lol, the waitress came running after me to tell me they forgot to put tapioca in my drink *DERPINA* Surprised, I didn't even realize the mistake until she pointed it out so I obviously had to go back and get the tapioca *facepalm & smdh*

Needless to say no one else had an order so I wasn't too sure as to why it was a.) taking light years to make a small drink... and b.) couldn't the bubble tea maker take that time it took to make my drink to make it right and remember what the hell I ordered since it's simply written on the receipt paper?! GAWD DAYUM PPLZ IT AINT THAT HARD *that's what she said...*

Upon drinking it, the tapioca had a strange taste - I assume they use some weird ass syrup to soak the tapioca in that makes me feel like what I'm eating tastes like what flowers smell like.. oh geeze lol sounds delicious right? *barf* I also noticed it was still mid-day and they were out of certain macarons and during closer inspection, you could tell most of the shells were a bit cracked.

"Have I just been completely unobservant, or do they purposely make their buffet an inside secret that only regulars know about? We came here near closing time on a Friday night, wondering if we could get anything before they closed. We casually asked about lamb shank, and the guy told us that we can get it when the buffet starts. Now the heating counters at the back made sense! So I guess they do this buffet on Friday nights after the regular closing time--whether this was a special event or one that is more regular on other days, I have no idea. I don't recall seeing any other signs or reading other Yelp reviews about this.

So we stayed and waited about half an hour (they didn't officially get started until past 8:20), and people kept pouring in over the next hour until the place completely filled up. At $15 a person (they price by the pound if you take out), it really was a good bargain. Most of their items are the same as on the regular menu, but what really stuck out was the lamb shank that we originally wanted. Huge bones with a lot of flavorful attached meat. What more can you want? 

Some of the chicken items were pretty dry, so I'll probably avoid that for future visits. They also bring out some soups, desserts, and a salad and fruit bar. So this was a pretty standard (but awesome) buffet.",1.0

I paid for it, they took the money from my account, gave me a ""pick up today"" barcode to show to customer service and I should be happily on my way......HAHAHA 
I show up, show them my phone. The girl just looks at me and says go to jewelry someone can help you there. 1st, hello rude girl. I don't know walmart like the back of my hand like you do, so where is that? She just points. Okay, fail one walmart customer service.
I'm going to speed this part. After speaking to 6 different people who have no idea where this bike is or what's going on, while someone says ""hold on"" and they disappear for 45 minutes without telling me what they were doing or that they would be back, I find out that they don't have that bike, and it's on back order. 
Um, well why would it be pickup now? ""I don't know"". OMG, so helpful! I ask if I can just exchange it for one they have on property, they said no. After throwing a fit and speaking with management they were able to override a return, which doesn't deposit until 48-72 hours. I didn't have enough money in my account to get one on site, so I had to leave empty handed.
AND to top it off, I purchased a warranty with the bike, which they didn't return! So after doing it myself online they tell me it won't be returned for 2 BILLING CYCLES. WHAT?!?!?!
Worst customer service ever for a corporate company. I've written numerous letters and left complaint messages for their customer service line and have received zero response. SO yelp it is!

"I *love* this place!

I recommend using Open Table or calling for a reservation ahead of time because this place gets PACKED.  Somehow I can always get a reservation right away, but without a reservation there's a wait.

They have a really nice outdoor patio that I like in the warmer months.  In the colder months its indoors, and the building used to be an old hotel.  It feels like an old building.  Its a nice restaurant but it does look a little bit dated upstairs with the green stripes on the walls.

BUT---are you here to check out the decor or are you here to EAT?

I effing love Atria's food.  It's probably so unhealthy but I don't care.  Why is it so good?  How???  I strongly recommend the Miso Glazed salmon, the meatloaf, the pot roast, the goat cheese ravioli and their reuben's are to die for.  Literally you might die, bc they are so tasty they've got to be FULL of butter.

No one ever ate a reuben for their health.

The pot roast nacho's are OUTSTANDING.  In fact ,any time I want to get my Dad to come to Atria's with me, I don't ask if he wants to go to Atria's, I ask if he is in the mood for Pot Roast Nachos.  Turns out, Dad's always in the mood for pot roast nachos.

The only thing on the menu I don't recommend are the fish tacos.  I had them on Saturday and they were just not excellent.  Still tasty though!

The service is outstanding.  Our waitress this past Saturday was Daya and she was so pleasant that we'll ask for her section when we come back.

They have a killer cocktail list too, the Blood Orange martini tastes like angels squeezed it from golden oranges in heaven.  ???  Ok, I don't know what that meant, it is just a damn good martini.

Also, I spent my formative childhood years in Stuttgart, Germany.  Their Oktoberfest menu is HANDS DOWN the most authentic, best tasting German food in Pittsburgh.  I get asked where to get the best German food all the time.  It's at Atria's, during their woefully limited Oktoberfest menu.

The Chicken Paprika is ...  AUSGEZIECHNET.  WUNDER BAR.  Really effing good.  

Everyone in Pittsburgh eats at Atria's, but if you havent yet, you really should make a reservation!",1.0

"After reading all the negative reviews from fellow Yelpers about the service & seeing a ""help wanted"" sign on the door when I drove by, I decided to give this place a try.  

Probability has it, if they are seeking new servers, they must have fired the bad ones.  Right?  I have to say this is a likely possibility.  When my family and I decided to eat lunch here yesterday (Dec. 31, 2013), I believe the service has gotten a lot better (based on Yelpers past experiences).  Our waitress ""Daniele"" was on top of things & very kind.  She even had a good sense of humor when I asked for a wheelchair...  (I stuffed my face with the $5.50 giant pizza slice & soda rather quickly).

"I'm from Canada and I've never been to a Ross before (yes I know, tragic) so when I saw this one, I decided it was time to do a little shopping. 

Ross is very much like a Winners or Marshalls but with about four times as much stuff per area. I spent over an hour just poking around, picking things out to try on. It's a packed store, not much room to maneuver and there were a lot of people there, but I took my time and found some amazing deals.

The store itself was pretty messy, especially near the change rooms and the cash. You're only allowed to bring so many things into the change room and I had to leave a few things outside, but I didn't need them in the end. There are tons of goodies to be had in the cash line (surprise surprise impulse buys) and the line itself moved pretty quickly.

When I went to pay, I was given the option (after swiping my credit card) to pay in CAD or USD, which I thought was great. Saved me some fees and I got the current exchange rate. 

Overall, a great store and I wish I'd come back to look for more. I couldn't believe some of the deals I got, including a dress fit for a wedding guest for $17 and two shirts for about $8 each!",1.0
"I've been to a Waffle House before and the service was top notch and super fast so I was excited to try this one out. I came on a Sunday morning and the lady taking names didn't even greet me and was super rude, she also said the wait would be 15-20 minutes and we waited for almost an hour. When getting seated I noticed several dirty napkins utensils on the floor. then a young lady named Britney came to give us our drinks, she rudely asked ""who's the coffee for?"" we then waited for another 45 mins for our food and when we had to get up to ask for our waffles! when our waffles came they were cold and Britney rudely came back to take the plates we were done with and we could clearly hear her complaining about our table to another employee. there was never an apology for the wait or delay in our food. the whole staff looked very unprofessional and we're running around like they had no idea what to do. I'm only giving this place one star because I don't have the option for zero stars.

"I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).  Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.

My dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.

Fifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.

It took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.

Unsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon.",1.0

"Today I ordered a Chile Rellenos Plate, and a Bowl of Hatch Green Chile with Chicken.

The Chile Rellenos had the red sauce, was flavorful but not very spicy.  Had a homemade taste to it which I enjoyed; beans\/rice were excellent.  The Chile itself however was just ok.  It was more of an omelette with a chile inside.  It had a good flavor, but my wife is picky and didn't enjoy the omelette-style chile.  Normally it's a fluffy egg mixture encasing the chile with a crisp texture on the outside.  What she had was an omelette filled with strips of chile, not a stuffed chile.

I ate the bowl of Hatch Green Chile with Chicken, which was $8.25.  I ordered our meals to go, and I was surprised to see what I ordered in a 16-oz soda cup.  It came with 3 small tortillas (dipping or to make a taco?? tasty but wasn't really sure.) and that was that.  It was bland at first, but then the pepper and green chile builds as you eat it creating a peppery-heat that tastes good.  It was more watery than I expected, and the tortillas didn't really serve a place.  I was pretty disappointed immediately that I had just paid about $9 for a cup of soup.  I thought it was going to be more like a rice-bowl or something.

Now, to stay positive, my wife and I eat their Hatch Chile breakfast burritos regularly at the farmer's market.  We always enjoy them, they are $6.95 and delicious.  HUGE too.  I have to say though, I was very disappointed with what I ordered today.  I suppose I'll stick with that burrito at the market.",1.0

I sat at the bar and the bartender was very attentive and friendly. One of my sides was the mac and cheese and I can honestly say that it was some of the cheesiest, and therefore some of the best that I have had.",1.0

They do a terrific job on their marketing as we always get stuff in the mail promoting this place.  The decor of the restaurant is great, but overall the stuff that matters is lacking.

Then the lady she passed me off to ended messing up my nail polish and that is when i got mad and just left. Why have a nail salon full of people who DONT know how to do nails.

The Second time i went with a friend and they refused to do our nails an hour before they closed becuase they were ""too busy""( with about only 4 people in the salon) i guess this place really does not  want to make money.

"Mothers dumplings is a tradition for me and my family around Christmas time. They have great dumplings both meaty and vegetarian that are handmade in store while you watch. They are quick, affordable but mostly tasty. The chive, pork, and shrimp dumplings are great but the beef and green onion is even better! But one of their best dishes isn't even a dumpling... Its the sauteed eggplant stir fry. A definite must try. We also had some noodle soup and plain congee (add your favorite seasoning!). There is also a salad that is somewhat Korean in flavor and design: smashed cucumber salad. It provides a fresh bite to clean your palate.

We waited twelve business days, still no internet, and called in to find out, ""Your payment was declined, we sent you an email.""

In addition, he answered a lot of questions about my goal of early retirement, and gave me great guidance about how to structure my finances for a stable flow of income.  He analyzed the issue of when to take Social Security (and the answer can be different for all of us, based on dozens of different factors), and set me on the right track there.  He's also available during the course of the year for many what-if questions:  

1) Should I refinance my mortgage?
2) Is it better to just make additional payments in order to retire it sooner?
3) At what point is the standard deduction greater than my mortgage interest?

Having worked in property management,  it was rather horrifying to see the shenanigans and carelessness that happened. One of the biggest things that stand out was the renovation period when they hired contractors to pull the wooden slats that decorated the patio. The slats were gone in one day, but rusted nails and splintered wood covered the balcony for DAYS. Health hazard to the extreme. Also, at one point during the stay, I ended up having to put multiple pots and buckets underneath all the sprinklers because when it rained, water would leak from them. It was also rather sketchy that security guards spent most of the time in their cars in the back of the parking lot.

The dirty martinis are fabulous. And they have a decent wine selection. So...maybe I'm partial. I am all in on this one. I hope they stay for a long time. It's everything I want in a bar. If you want to game, they have video poker at the bar and numerous flat screen TVs. The music is awesome with its eclectic selection. If you get the chance, check their website for when Patrick Genovese is there on a Friday or Saturday night. He is a phenomenal, and I mean knock your socks off, singer and guitar player. Mind blown. You can go in casual, but feel high class. It's worth it to check it out.",1.0
"These guys came highly recommended by my neighbor, so I booked F&F to steam my carpets after a pretty dusty renovation project. Fred called me two hours before our appointment time and said he was in the neighborhood! Came right over and did the most thorough job of any company I've ever had before. I would highly recommend these guys. He also added tack strips and finished the edges of my carpet where old carpet had been torn up and replaced with tile. A beautiful and professional job! Communication was great. Prices are definitely reasonable since they charge by square footage. Quiet machinery. He took excellent care of my place, and I'll definitely use them again!",1.0

One server had to completely walk around us in order to get to the other tables. It was impossible to not see us. While we realize we probably weren't purposely ignored, it sure felt like we were. After 20 minutes (yes, we literally timed it) we walked out. We even decided to give them one last shot by talking to the host\/hostess, but they were unapologetic and disinterested.

"$27 prix fix menu

I was drawn here by the high ratings and the $27 prix fix menu. Also, the OpenTable points are always a nice bonus :)

My BFF wanted to try something new, so I did some research on Yelp and was convinced! We came on a Sunday on the long weekend. I called to make sure that they were still offering the prix fix menu (being a long weekend and all) and they did.

They give you some bread with this hummus-like spread, which was very good. Two types of bread - the crust was hard, but not bad.

We both ordered the soup to start. It was some tomato soup (think marinara sauce) with chunks of seafood in it (I think lobster or shrimp...). A bit spicy but still good.

I had the steak frites. It was quite large - probably more than 8oz like the menu said. It was thick cut and cooked medium rare. I saw past reviews and knew that if I wanted medium rare, I would have to tell them medium. Unfortunately, it was quite tough and chewy. The aioli was good. The fries were quite hard. The picture on their website is not what came on my plate.

My BFF got the salmon. This was very good - deliciously seasoned and cooked well. I would recommend getting this. However, the size of the salmon seemed smaller than what others have gotten here, judging by the pictures on Yelp.

We were given no choice for dessert. It was an upside-down pineapple cake. It took quite awhile to get to the table, but I guess they were baking it? It was plated very nicely with super sweet caramel surrounding the cake. My BFF complained that the pineapple on top was not fresh \/ fake. I ate his share.

Service was average, I would say. We ended up paying $70 after tax and tip. I guess for a 3-course meal, it's not bad. My BFF said he would go again, and that it would be a good place for a special occasion or a date (lol). Avoid the steak frites!",1.0
"Took my mother here for mothers day. It was very busy and we did not have a reservation but they did accomodate us and sat us at a table on the patio.

I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy, it was supposed to come with green chili but the only green chili was in the mashed potato. The chicken was dry and there was very little gravy. My mother ordered the breakfast tacos. They had bacon egg and cheese in them. The eggs were dry and not fluffy overall very bland and they did not come with salsa, i asked the waitress to bring some and she did accomodate. My girlfriend had the juevos rancheros she indicated that they were very bland as well.",1.0
"Viva Chicken is my new favorite lunch spot, but I had to give this three stars because three times out of the six times I've been here, there has been an issue with my order.  

I always order the quinoa-stuffed avocado (a must try if you haven't had it!) with a side house salad.  The first time, my avocado arrived with chicken and had to be sent back.  The second time, I received a salad with chicken (no avocado or house salad).  The third time (which happened yesterday, 5\/19), I placed an order online for pick up that, according to the confirmation email I received, was to be ready at 12:44pm.  I arrived at 1pm to pick it up, and the order had been lost.  I showed the email to the staff at the register.  I did not receive an apology from the staff, all I was told was that the kitchen was backed up and that they would try to push the order through.  I received it ten minutes later.  

Will I go back?  Probably, because I love the avocado.  In the meantime, I think I will be taking a break so hopefully I'll have better luck next time.",1.0

I love Brit. This performance is amazeballs! 90 mins of Bspears hits, fantastic visuals, screens and lights everywhere, spectacular props, top notch dancing. And the venue? OMG. Not one bad seat to be had- about 4,000 seats and no obstructed views. Everyone gets a Piece of Brit, and she gets a piece of her fans, too.

The lobby offers up close looks at Brit's famous costumes, tons of merch, Moët Chandon booth, tons and tons of bar options, snacks. Heck yes. Oh, and you can re enter the venue if you need to go out for any reason. Bonus.

True, the show is completely choreographed second by second, but the entertainment value overrides any misgivings about what is typically a little more organic during a standard tour. This truly is an experience and the vibe in the Axis theater is addicting-

"I love Chase's Diner! 
My family and friends have been going there regularly since they opened. Its a great diner with the pretty much diner classics you would expect.... not too mention some unexepected gems as well. 
The restaurant is always really clean, and the staff is always friendly. Often times when you walk in the door you will be greated not only my a hostess\/server, but also a freindly shout from the kitchen too. 

I am a big fan of their chicken fried steak. They have a dinner and a breakfast option for it, however I always opt for the breakfast one regardless of time of day. 
A good cup of coffee, Chase's chicken fried steak, two eggs over easy, some soudough toast , and life definitely doesn't suck. 

Its hard to say enough good things about Chase's Diner... 
I guess mostly it is  great to see a locally owned small business that values its customers having success. Chase's is a great example of exactly that!

"TLDR: late-night specials on week nights, friendly service, bakery items to-go, moderately priced entrees otherwise

Grand Cafe is the only way the casino can function due to its 24-hour status. We frequent this location after 11 o'clock bingo or a late-night movie or boba run since it's close to home. Having been to other grand cafés, I'm happy to write this review to share my experience, food quality, and service provided. 

All of the servers work their butt off, including the manager who always wears a coat. My last experience was on a Thursday night\/Friday morning at 1230am. It was the only time I'm ever waited in a line to be seated. The hostess\/cashier\/bakery attendant informed me that Thursday nights have been busier than the weekends and it's the day that's staffed the least. But since, it's the last day where you can get the late-night specials, it makes sense. 

My order varies based on my appetite, but I love breakfast so I can't resist anything with eggs. I usually order the All-nighter skillet: 2 eggs, hash browns, and toast for $1.99. What a steal? If I'm being an extra fatty, I pair it with a short stack: 2 large pancakes about 8 inches in diameter with a buttery residue...it's also $1.99. Sometimes I order the 1\/2 pound classic burger with mayo, lettuce and tomato (no onions please) and it comes with fries...all for $2.99. My friend ordered the chicken fried steak for $5.99: 2 eggs, hash browns, 2 pieces of toast, and a large piece of chicken fried steak (about the size of 2 palms). It's actually pretty filling and doesn't taste half-bad. 

I'm really big on water and there filtered water tastes awesome. Refills are 80% consistent, but I drink so much that my expectations are low for refills, especially when my server is tasked with 9 tables. I'm pretty patient at this location and the free wifi helps. The one time I've had a problem, I brought it to the attention of the manager and my meal was free. Ever since then, I've always come and been served with respect.",1.0

"This is a review for the leisure centre part of the hotel only. I dropped by last Sunday and purchased a day pass ($35 each for the day). I was in the mood for a swim and sauna, and as my building doesn't have these facilities I figured it was worth trying.

The changing areas are clean and bright, with plenty of towels. Beware that locks are not provided and you can't rent them, so you'll need to bring your own or carry your backpack with you to the pool area or gym.

The pool itself is of a decent size, half indoors and half outdoors. There are plenty of lounge chairs around should you want to relax in the sunshine. The pool is also filled with salt water which made a refreshing change, as I always find that chlorine dries my skin out too much.

Having had enough of the pool, I decided to try the hot tub which was perfectly warm but there was very little (if any) water pressure from the jets - a bit disappointing. Next on my list was the dry sauna which was great, and a bucket was provided to pour water on the coals.

All in all, I really enjoyed my experience here, but a star was lost for not having a way to secure your valuables - not even having locks to rent or a few kept behind the counter as a courtesy to paying guests.",1.0
"This location shares their front door with Shibui. As you walk into the reception area, you have a choice to head downstairs into Shibui or upstairs to be seated in Copacabana. On the third floor, there seems to be a lounge and bar sort of deal going on. The sign outside is kind of understated so you gotta pay attention or you might miss it when you're walking by.

The service was reasonably quick on a Wednesday night at around 7. Most of the tables were filled and you could smell the delicious meats as the servers passes your table. Earlier in the night, servers also walked by with corn bread and cheese balls (should really try the corn bread!) Once you grab a plate and fill it with your selection from the salad bar, servers will know to come by with various selections of meat.

I thought the pasta\/salad bar was pretty average. The cheese and prosciutto selection they had also wasn't that impressive either. However, some dishes to try on your visit: their cole slaw, mussels, and sweet potato mash. These were the only ones that really jumped out at me. 

Onto the meats: we didn't see any filet mignon, pork ribs, or turkey breast last night, and pork sausage was by request only - it kind of tasted like chewy spam. I particularly liked the buttermilk steak and Moroccan spicy chicken. Anything with the cheese was also very juicy and tender but a tad salty. My friends also enjoyed the chimichurri prime ribs. Lamb and beef ribs only came out once, which was a bit of let down as we did enjoy those. As a whole, the meats were well flavored, tender, and very juicy. Everything was cooked until a medium rare which I loved.

The pineapple really lived up to my expectations - dusted with a bit of cinnamon and perhaps sugar, it had slightly crunchy edges and was very sweet. Our table loved it and we asked for seconds the next couple times they came around. Definitely something you should try. It would have been nice to have a small selection of fresh fruits after the seriously heavy meal though. 

For the price, this restaurant is something you'd want to try at least once, and for a special occasion only (they charged us a dollar each for water with no notice). Their focus is really on the meats, and that's where you get the most bang for your buck. Go on an empty stomach and you'll have a great time sampling their Rodizio grilled meats.",1.0

I called to order take out tonight and the number was disconnected so I checked yelp and found the review from Stephanie H. stating that it was under new ownership.

A very nice woman answered the phone and I asked about the change in ownership. She confirmed this, but said the recipes are the same so I cautiously ordered two of our favorites: Tom yum soup and Panang curry, both with chicken and medium spice level. NOT THE SAME!! The tom yum was better than many that I have had around the valley, but it was missing that complexity that I loved so much in Pete's. The spice level was comparable. The Panang curry was a weak, runny mess :( It seems like they started with a decent curry paste, but added way too much coconut milk rendering it extremely watery and tasteless. Again, it was missing the soul and it makes me so sad.

If I had to nit pick on anything, the fried calamari isn't season, so you would definitely have to dip it in the sauce provided with it, or with some soy sauce.  Occasionally, there would be either a mix up of orders, or they forgot something.  It doesn't bother me.   All you have to do is tell them, and they will get you what you want right away.  The restaurant is small, but the ambiance is great.  Just gotta be aware if you are bringing a bigger group.  Also advise that you order the bake rolls at the beginning since they take time.

I'm giving this establishment one star because they screwed up a simple order.  I ordered 3 donuts glazed and 2  medium hazelnut iced coffees.

"I'm guessing people from Pittsburgh are super picky about their diners.  Being from the South, you don't generally find a whole lot of places like these that aren't massive chain stores.

This place will not make two. 

I arrived after the big breakfast rush, but before the lunch crowd arrived. The place wasn't packed, all three of the waitresses were super helpful, my coffee stayed hot and fresh, and they made certain that I knew what I was doing when I ordered. I ordered the Gregory's Favorite, and the biscuits and white sausage gravy were almost as good as my grandmother's. The eggs were perfectly scrambled, the hash was covered in peppers and onion, and I barely got the word ""hot"" out of my mouth before the waitress flashed three bottles of hot sauce at me and let me pick one. I took photos and mailed them back to my Army buddies, and the string of curse words hurled my direction made the food nearly perfect. Nothing like jealousy to make a visit perfect.

At least for $9 they better have not been my usual ones. There was I think 5 or 6 fried crispy pieces in red miso, garlic, and sesame, small yes but delicious. I kind of wished I had more. 

The next item was the Pork Shoulder Steam Buns http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/yusho-las-vegas-2?select=UioPVMGCzrAhEBhmwxoDCQ#7h3L67sTasIEWUrHlf_J2A It was a juicy piece of pork shoulder with their kim chi, some cilantro, and other things on a white steam bun. It had a lot of flavor. Again it was a little small for me but tasty.

Next was the Fried Duck Leg it's crispy on the outside juicy and tender on the inside, delicious. It was served with a plum BBQ sauce, some herbs, and a couple white steam buns. I love duck and loved this dish. It was probably the simplest to make dish I had.

I don't remember the rest of the items just the picked oshinko cucumbers, lotus root, and carrot salad. I also liked for being veggies. The rest of the menu is pretty much grilled items (tofu steaks, NY aged strip steak, shishito peppers, etc.), fried items (more fried chicken, veggie tempura, maitake mushroom, etc), noodles, steam buns, pickeled, and sweet items (I heard about the doughnut made from tofu, sweet potato, and rosemary it sound good I forgot to try some, another time).

The customer service was excellent. The interior is nice and spacious. Good selection of alcoholic beverages, from beers, cocktails, sakes, and wines.

"This was my first experience buying a vehicle over the internet. Jake and Dylan made it a very easy transaction. Dylan worked to get me a great interest rate on my loan, they took care of all the necessary paperwork for my tax and license fees in Colorado and got me on the road quickly. I would have opted to have the truck delivered to me in CO but I have family in AZ so I took advantage of the opportunity to pick the truck up and have some time to visit with them.  When it comes time to purchase another vehicle, I will start my search with JBA Motors first.",1.0
"Tonight six of us went to Local Bistro with 5:30 reservations. To say we were impressed was an understatement. I have eaten at many restaurants, but none match the level of customer service that we received tonight. Christina, our food server, was sensational. Despite many requests from us, she filled each request with professionalism and aplomb. 

The food was fantastic. From the salads to the entrees, everyone was humming. When the broasted chicken came out a little underdone for one person in our party, not only did they graciously take it back to cook it a little longer, but brought out a small salad at their expense so that our guest wouldn't be sitting there while everyone else was eating. The chicken did come out a few minutes later and it was perfect. The BBQ ribs were to die for, the salmon was great, and the New York was terrific. In addition, we enjoyed a bottle of Rombauer chardonnay for only $48. To top off the evening, the manager brought out three complimentary deserts for us to enjoy.

What more could you ask for -- great food, great service, and great atmosphere. We will all be back, and I would encourage any of you in the Scottsdale area to give Local Bistro a try.",1.0

"Came here tonight for a family dinner and upon entering, the atmosphere immediately turned me off. As I went into the bathroom to wash my hands, I was startled by a dead COCKROACH lying on the floor. Not to mention, the food was terrible. I ordered pupusas, thinking ""how could they screw this up?"" Well they did, there was absolutely no flavor and the traditional sauce was extremely watered down. Moreover, the flies constantly buzzing around and landing on my food didn't make it any more appetizing... I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1.0
"Absolutely love this place.  I work on the eighth floor and I come down almost every day.  While only open until two, I know that I can get coffee, soda or an amazing chicken quesadilla anytime.  Fridays are 'Pancake Fridays', he always has fresh, homemade banana nut bread, and the clam chowder is to die for.  I will sincerely miss coming here when our office moves at the end of the month.  He accepts card and cash, but there is a small minimum purchase for cards.  There are also a few tables available to sit down and eat if you're not too keen on heading back to the office just yet.",1.0
"After cartel in Tempe this is one of my favorite coffee shops in Phoenix! The staff is great! And the owner is often there so quality is always at the top.  The only real problem with the place is it's so popular it's often very crowded, if you want to meet someone there make sure to show up early so that you will have a spot. Outlets are plentiful and it's a great place to get work done. The food is delicious (and if you don't like it pane bianco is next door) and the pastries are dangerously good. The coffee is excellent and roasted in house. They're also surprisingly affordable, except for the meals and alcohol which aren't cheap but Aren't too expensive either.",1.0
"My first ever Yelp review!  Why Yellowtail?  Because this was the best meal I've ever had.  Period.

I was lucky enough to have The Light Group as a client and was given total VIP treatment:  not only a comped dinner, but the best seats in the house on their balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains  (other diners actually asked my friend and I if we were celebrities - extra points!)

We were greeted personally by Chef Akira Back who offered to bring us all of his personal favorites on the menu and we were so glad he did.  Everything was mouthwateringly delicious but there are 3 must haves: 

Tuna pizza - don't ask just eat, it has truffle oil!  
Baked crab roll - melts in your mouth better than chocolate

"We had a tankless water heater that stopped producing hot water and needed immediate repair. My home insurance referred me to Belsito and when I called I spoke to Rachel who I found to be pleasant, professional, and very understanding that we needed someone asap to service our unit. She asked me if there was an error code displayed on the unit (which there was).  It was late in the day, so she told me a service technician would be there by 8am the next morning. Roger (the technician) arrived right on time and I was surprised to hear that he had already made numerous phone calls around the valley to locate the part needed for the repair. He was able to determine the needed part from the code I gave to Rachel the day before. The part was not available anywhere local. I was assured by Roger that he would take care of everything. He made the call to my insurance company, explained the situation, got the work order, and proceeded to call the out of state manufacturer directly to order the part and have it shipped overnight. When the part arrived at their shop the next day, Rachel immediately dispatched Roger to come out to finish the repair. He showed up and was done in about 30 mins. 
    I cannot say enough good things about the way Belsito handled my repair. The office support staff were extremely professional and helpful. Roger was the right guy for the job. Tankless water heaters can be very complex, and Roger told me that he had years of experience working on these units. He did a  fantastic job. I will highly recommend Belsito Plumbing.",1.0

"I've never been a fan of this place. There is something about the food that just doesn't do it for me. The crispy potstickers were kind of disappointing. They were too crisp but maybe that's a bias opinion since I love steamed dumplings much better. 

You get a choice of small or regular size for your meal. I chose regular and I must say, it was more than enough. I got a lunch the next day out of it. My pictures are both regular size meals and the crispy dumplings. 

They have that fancy fountain drink dispenser that is all electronic. You get to choose from many different drinks and even mix them if you like. 

For two regular meals, appetizer and one drink, the cost was around $28. The food was just okay but it was fast and enough to fill your belly.",1.0
"I just did the tour this past weekend and the tour guide was very passionate and knowledgeable about sake. His class was wonderfully informative and engaging. Yes, the tour was not a true walk through the sake brewery and more like a sake class with a tasting of four sakes.  I enjoyed the sake-excellent sake and at a another level from the other sake products I had. Are there ways to improve the sake tour...yes, but there was a lot of positivity and true small brewery passion that imbued from our class and that makes me feel good about the product I am drinking!",1.0

I sent pics to the owner mike and he threatened to take me court.... Really for a $100 carpet cleaning job??? My home warranty company recommended them and didn't even cover the repair so it ALL came out of my pocket even after the service fee...thanks 1st American home warranty...,it would seem a home warranty company would hire reputable contractors to come take care of your problems, not cause damage.... Very disappointed... Wish there were negative stars",1.0
"The only thing this place has over other places serving frozen yogurt is the opportunity to put as much in the cup as you'd like to serve yourself before laying on as many toppings that little snotty nosed kids have been running their fingers through to your heart's content. Then get to be charged out the rear for the opportunity for self service! YAY! We think we're in New York or Boston, not Stow, OH.

Seriously, take the kids somewhere else. Other little heathens with filthy hands have been fingering the toppings. They charge an EXORBITANT amount for the privilege of self service. And they claim to be ""christians"". Don't remember ever reading any passage in any bible that says, ""Thou shalt stick it to thine neighbor as hard as possible at every whimsy. Yea, thou shalt reap the toil of others' hard work at self service.",1.0
"My partner and I came here for a mid-week brunch after the first day in summer school. It was busy but we were seated soon as we arrived. All of the staff was very pleasant. The waitress did not over bother us, which is always a big plus for someone like me who doesn't like people watching them eat or bother them while I am eating lol. The portion sizes are not gigantic but much larger than a bistro style café. We try the Irish Benny, the Irish Hash, the cheese grapes which were extremely creamy! And we also tried a stack of the Oreo cookie pancakes we added peanut butter and syrup and it was simply delightful! We will definitely be coming back!",1.0
"The other night was wonderful! I met her in the city after cocktails with friends. I was blindsided...I had no idea she would just randomly come into my life like that, but it happened. She's on the petite side, and puts herself together a little nicer than most girls around that part of town. The moment we connected though, I knew she was far from hollow. In fact, she was one of the most down-to-earth, simple, yet complex, ladies I've met in a long time who is filled to the brim with good things, and she's not the type of lady just looking for your money. When we kissed, time stopped, and in that moment I knew true bliss...and needed a napkin.

She's a mini quesadilla, and for $2, she's more than worth venturing to Yaquis, one of Phoenix's legit late-night grub spots, for. I always used to get the tacos, but this time I went with a gut feeling, and it paid off! No longer will I be held down by my self-bestowed shackles! No longer will I preach that the tacos are king, and that they're the only food that matters at Yaquis! For the sky opened up, and a divine thing occurred that beautiful night...I know now what I must do. I must shout it from the mountaintop! THE! MINI! QUESADILLAS! ARE! DELICIOUS!

"Service? What service? There is no service!

This is a cafeteria with self serve food. The food is above average which is why I return. The lunch buffet it good and it is close to the Cleveland Clinic for a fast lunch. A couple of weeks ago I went at 1pm and there was no food left and despite people continuing to come in, there was little attempts to replenish it. 

I did not want to return but once again because the food is decent and I figured if I went at noon there would be food at least. One person working behind the counter waved to a table as we walked in then disappeared in the kitchen during most of our visit. Other guests in the restaurant has to knock on the kitchen door for him to come out and cash them out. He wanted until more guests arrive to clear the dirty tables, and didn't bring us any water until after we started eating. This btw was the only 'service' we received, aside from waiting for him to again emerge from the kitchen to check out, in which he left before I finished signing the check.

The restaurant in general is dirty, and we had to go through multiple plates before we found a clean one for the buffet. It is a hole in the wall so I take it for what it is, but I've never experienced a place where they people working there just didn't care. Maybe it would be ok it you ordered take out and just judged the food, but despite how the flavor may be, I can't imagine the quality that goes into the food is going to be much different than the effort displayed in the rest of the restaurant.",1.0
If I could rate this company with negative stars I would. They are scammers basically. The don't enforce their own leases. Tenants have all rights owners have NONE. What a rip off and a joke. Might as well be ready to be a doormat once they get tenants in your home. They will be turned into the association of Realtors. I for one do not agree with their business ethics and practices. How horrible this company is!! DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR BUSINESS PERIOD. Also will be contacting BBB. Get on top of your shit and enforce your contracts with YOUR tenants. Pathetic. A property management company should take care of literally EVERYTHING for the home owner. But this so called business is a crock of crap.

"How can somebody who's always had a sweet tooth like me not love this place? I've been telling myself I'll cut back on my sweets intake - it's been a battle that I keep losing. Since this shop is in the same complex as a  Gold's Gym - that's a good enough excuse to indulge in sweet treats, right?

The shop is so cute. Black and white interior and the colors come from the beautiful cakes, pastries and macarons they have. I'm actually wishing my birthday was much sooner so I can get a birthday cake from here. They serve hot chocolate, tea and coffee, milk, juice, soda...and alcohol (at night). Champagne, wine and beer + dessert? Can I just live here? 

Before I continue, I must say that my love for macarons started when I first had them in Paris - oh l'amour! So, I'm not one of those that eat them because they're trendy or whatever. The fad can die but I'd still love macarons. These French cookies are my faves just like chunky chocolate chip cookies. I'd go to a macaron shop at every city I visit for comparison and get macarons in ALL their flavors. So, I'm glad the Vegas area has Gimme Some Sugar. My true test for macarons is pistachio macarons but unfortunately, they didn't have it when I went but I think you can special order items a day before.

They have 10 macaron flavors at a time. I think 2 are seasonal flavors and 8 mainstays. I've tried 10 flavors: fig & goat cheese, Snickerdoodle, strawberries & champagne, Nutella, PB&J, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake, maple-bacon, Snickers Candy bar and chocolate-covered strawberry. I got 14 macarons - I had to get an extra fig and goat cheese macaron and 2 extra Nutella macarons. I also got a fresh fruit pavlova and a green tea cheesecake. As for the macarons, here's how each ranks:

5\/5: fig & goat cheese, Nutella, chocolate-covered strawberry

4\/5: Snickerdoodle, PB&J, Snickers candy bar, maple-bacon bar

3\/5: strawberries & champagne, grandpa's blueberry pancake, birthday cake

Green Tea Cheesecake:
I love green tea and not a lot of places have green tea cheesecake. The crust is crunchy. The cheesecake is deliciously creamy with a good green tea flavor. It's topped with a thin sesame nougatine and a raspberry. Amazing! 5\/5

Fresh Fruit Pavlova:
A pavlova is a meringue topped with fruits. It's light and crisp. It's like a ""healthier"" dessert if you will. 5\/5

They warned me that the birthday cake was really sweet and that I shouldn't get it if I was torn between that and another flavor. Hooray for honesty! The fig & goat cheese macaron sounds a bit unusual but it's actually good since I love goat cheese. Sweet fig + tart goat cheese...yum! Nutella is a no-brainer...it's instant love for me. The strawberries & champagne sounded real good and looks so pretty and dainty but the flavors were mild but really sweet. I think the strawberry flavor needs to be more pronounced. I got lucky to have the last maple-bacon macaron. Score! 

The service is amazing here. Very friendly and honest. I was holding up the line with all the desserts I got and I felt bad for the people behind me who came in just to pick up 2 items. But one of the girls who was helping me out offered them a cookie so everything was fine and dandy. Sure, the desserts here cost an average of $7 apiece and the macarons are $3.50-4.50 each - the macarons are HUUUUGE though (the size of your palm or about 4 macarons) and the ingredients are of quality. Hello? I don't mind paying for something good. You can actually get $1 off with a Yelp check-in. And if you buy more than 6 macarons, you get 50cents off each additional you buy.

"This review is a bit late; though thought to share my positive experience... Rented a unit on the third floor - which faced outward \/ away from the pool so I had no issues with outside noise(s). It was nice to have the sun rays stream in through my bedroom window in the mornings. I never had to use the heater; I was told the ""winter"" (what winter?) was not as rough when I was in Arizona. The A\/C - I only used during the ""super hot"" months. 

Pros: Location - very close to the airport and not too far from eateries and other places (i.e., Fry's grocery store, Target, post office w\/ extended hours). Plus easy access to Hohokam Expressway\/Arizona State Route 143, Red Mountain Freeway\/Loop 202, and Interstate 10. Also not far from Scottsdale and Tempe. Underground parking with a reserved spot and closed hallways - helpful for avoiding dust storms hence my car stayed clean \/ dirt-free (most of the time)! Another pro: clean freak car wash nearby! Elevator - for carrying up groceries and large items when moving in\/out. Gated. W\/D in the unit. Also - storage included w\/ the apt (no extra cost). I used the gym only a few times as I usually went to the LA Fitness which was a close drive away in Scottsdale. Note - the regular parking lot is tight \/ not huge. 

I deducted one star as there was a huge spider near my door in the hallway once; that was a bit traumatizing. And, no recycling available on-site = not eco-friendly. Also once I came across zero soap in the bathroom near the gym = not cool. Other than that - no issues. I got all of my deposit back! During the latter part of my stay there, the entire exterior was getting re-painted; I re-visited Phoenix about one year after moving out and saw the finished job from afar = not bad!",1.0
I have gone to this place for a couple of years. And every time I come in I can see their popularity is rising. They have add more seating area which is great.

I work in the medical field so I am very observant about these things.   I made an appointment on line and printed the forms that needed to be filled.  This made the process quicker when I arrived.  Sunny welcomed me with a friendly smile and a sincere hello. While waiting, a young boy had gotten sick in the waiting room and Sunny quickly cleaned it up on her hands and knees without skipping a beat since more patients were coming in at the time.  She did wash her hands afterwards and used gloves.  The PA, Jon Patterson,   was very knowledgeable and explained everything with the questions I had asked him without being in a hurry since there was a room full of patients.

"I came in on a Friday morning because I needed to deposit a check that the ATM wouldn't accept for some reason. They opened at 9, I got in line at 9:15. It's Friday, which means it's going to be packed, and it was packed. There was a huge line, one teller working, and that one teller was stopping to hold long, drawn out conversations with each person she helped. I understand the tellers are trained to ""build a relationship"" with customers, but if you're the only person working and you've got a huge line the conversation needs to be kept to a minimum. After waiting in line for 30 minutes I finally just left. I had gone in so early so I could get my check deposited before heading in to work but ended up leaving so I wouldn't be late to work without having accomplished anything but getting irritated. And to top it off, when I left I wasn't even next in line, there were still 2 people ahead of me!!",1.0

"I don't know how this place has 4 stars. I've given it a try a couple times since it's near UNLV and cheaper than most AYCE places but nothing redeems this place of how below-average the sushi and service is. This place is crowded often but don't let it fool you, it's in a crowded area plus it's near the strip. The sushi is terrible. Their rice is always falling apart and the fish never tastes fresh. Plus their service is flat out rude. And if you don't want to take my word for it then take the Health District's word for it. THEY GOT CLOSED IN JUNE TWICE FOR FAILING THEIR HEALTH INSPECTION. And have gotten numerous C's in the past, many times getting over 30 demerits. Google it.

The last time I went, when my friend and I arrived the hostess seemed peeved we were waiting for the rest of our party. We didn't even insist we sit down at a table but she had attitude about us waiting. When we got to our table it was 2:50 and they tried to charge us dinner prices which we had to fight them about. (And who wants to do that?) If your menu has lunch prices till 3PM then it's lunch prices till 3PM. Its not a hard concept. It's not like a buffet where we are trying to get lunch prices for a dinner buffet..it's the same shiz.  One last person arrived at 2:59 and they made a stink that HE absolutely had to pay the dinner price. Okay fine, take your extra 3 dollars you crazy people.

Then we ate and I definitely didn't eat my moneys worth. Sushi looks like it's from a grocery store. Nothing special, tastes old.

I'm sorry but when your sushi is gross don't be so determined to charge the higher price. They were rude about the whole process too and like I said, the sushi sucks.  The first time I went there they started bringing rolls no one ordered and when we said that they argued with us then and put it on our table anyway. This business does not know how to pick their battles or treat their customers. It's scary going to a sushi place like this because they WILL argue you for more money, even when they're clearly in the wrong.

"As brief as my time here was, it did bring back the memories:)

As a kid, I love going to arcades and pumping quarters in to Zaxxon, Dig-Dug and Golden Axe and playing away until my arms hurt from hitting buttons and my eyes went blurry from staring at screens. 

Now, as an adult, someone apparently thought bringing those days back was a good idea...WITH BEER!! (and cocktails:) 

The 16 Bit has all those old games you remember, which I'm told are free if you order libations. They have no food selection, but you can bring your own (and there's no shortage of local spots to do so.) I was a little overwhelmed by the clientele...because there were ARMIES OF PEOPLE all over the place, but hey, it's a new spot, so I should expect a few folks there, no? It was also a bit loud, and despite the games, NOT a place for little ones due to the mass of humanity reliving their childhoods with adult beverages in hand. 

The prices are about standard, and there selection of mixed drinks is a real hoot (after you get a ""Steve Urkel"", I dare you not to look at your companions and say ""Did I drink thaaaat?:)

"AKA RHODES RANCH MAIDS


I live in Rhodes Ranch which is the same company  I found that they do not speak English or want to do the proper job  For several months they have been cleaning my home and  just this week I discovered they were putting the trash in the recycling can instead of the garbage can which in this complex is a huge no no  I called this morning and complained that this was unacceptable.  I was told that someone would be by between 3:30 and 4pm  No one showed up and just as I was sitting down to dinner at 5pm the doorbell rang when I again explained the problem the girl that came out emptied my garbage can and put the garbage in the recycling can which is what I did not want I was standing there pointing to the full recycling can and she got in her car and left.  If they do not want to do the job correctly then they should go back to whereever they came and forget about working in the Las Vegas area.  Now I still have the problem of the garbage being in the wrong can and I know the garbage men will not take the garbage because it is in the wrong can.  If they are going to call themselves Rhodes Ranch Maids they should know about the rules regarding the garbage.  I have left two more messages in hopes that a boss or the owner will return my call and send someone out to do the job right.  It is very insulting to be outside eating my dinner and trying to get this done properly only to have the girl get in her car and drive off leaving the mess behind.  At the next HOA meeting I am going to  request that the Board ban this company from using the Rhodes Ranch name on their business",1.0

"Room with a View""

When my parents visit they split their stay between my place and The Strip. Usually they roost at Bellagio or Wynn but this time they booked Palazzo. Check-in went well and the room was very nice. Bathroom on the right when you enter followed by the bedroom and sunken living room--complete with sectional couch and hassock. The window offered full views of the Wynn's golf course, as well as the city and mountains to the east. It was nice sitting there at sunset sipping cocktails, watching as the shadows of Wynn and Encore crept across dark green fairways. The pool area at Palazzo was okay, plenty of swimming holes but none very large or inviting. It was all kind of cramped and loud. Not my style nor that of my parents. They liked the room and location, however; yet I'm unsure whether they will room here again. As for me, I would not book a summer stay-cation here. The pools just left much to be desired.",1.0
"In my self-proclaimed foodie opinion, the overall delicious rating to nearly any restaurant can almost always be measured by two factors - their beverage menu, and their fries. 

For starters: Beverage Menu. 
They definitely offer some good brews from around the globe, but it's also apparent that they are corporate as there is nothing outrageously unique or exciting for those of us who really know beer. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed my Westmalle Belgian Duble and good beer is to be found. 

Secondly: Fries
I am a sucker for sweet potato fries so they naturally were delivered to my spot at the bar along side my burger. Big strike against any establishment who tops sweet potato fries with more sweetness. The marshmallow dipping sauce would have been a home run in a room full of little kids, but to appease a more development pallet, they need some saltiness to contrast the sweet. It's like adding that pinch of salt to the cookie dough that takes the cookies from yummy to outofthisworld. 

Overall review would be that it is good. Overpriced (but that's to be expected). And caters to the typical American pallet who seem to follow the motto that sugar and\/or cheese can make any dish better. The good news is that most people visiting Vegas probably fall in that category so many will be pleased. But for those who prefer burger and fries with a little more sophistication, it may not be it. Although I've yet to find an ideal burger spot on the strip so this may be as good as it gets.",1.0

Hate to do this since I never made it to the food but the atmosphere totally turned me off... So much so that we didn't even stay to eat. Weird corner spot in a small strip mall. The restaurant smelled like rotting meat. The bathroom was old and falling apart. The outdoor seating area was unkept and tables and chairs were rusting. We sat ourselves (as prompted) and no one came to the table after several minutes. And the straw that broke the camel's back for me....A waitress was coughing loudly into her hand as she took someone's order. We got up and walked out. Sorry just couldn't do it.,1.0
"I honestly try not to shop here, as everything is clearly over priced. The books are pretty average in prices, but the figures are painful, especially knowing you can pick up some in different places for a normal price (if you know where to look). I enjoy browsing the place and on occasion they have very good clearance items and sales.

Their blind boxes are all opened and each figure is priced individually based on rarity\/character. I rather pay 8$ for a blind box keychain and take my chances than pay more for the character I really want. What's the fun of that??

After hearing so much about Ken's in the Akron area for so long I couldn't wait to have a special dinner at the new location in Cleveland.  None of the 4 of us will go back as there are just too many other great places in Cleveland to dine.  Only 1 in the party had a meal that was satisfactory.  For the rest of us, one or more of the courses was either cold, tasteless or poorly presented.  For our money we'll hit Flemings, Mortons, OX, Lola - you name it.  

Decor is ok but I would like to suggest they tone down the TV monitor in the main dining room.  It displayed a ship on the lake (very cool) but it was a day time picture and with the room lights being low for dinner (very pleasant) those of us facing the monitor were blasted by the bright light of the day time sky in the picture.

"3.5 stars

I had seen this place driving by but found out it was an in network benefit when I checked my insurance website.  I'd been sick for 4 days and was in denial that it was anything more than an upper respiratory infection, or a cold.  I finally decided to head in knowing my symptoms weren't ER worthy, but realizing that my primary care wouldn't be able to swab for the flu.  

When I walked in I noticed a very strong scent.  Being sick, it was actually a little unbearable.  I wasn't sure if it was a strong cleaning product or a room deodorizer but I was really bothered by it! 

When I checked in at the front desk I asked the woman if they swabbed for the flu.  She said yes but that I'd probably be there for hours.  I wasn't sure if she was just informing me of the long wait, or discouraging me from waiting, but I proceeded to sign in.  

The good: I was only there a couple of hours in total, which was better than I though with how badly they were playing up the wait time.  The place was clean.  Plenty of seats in the waiting room.

The bad: One of the techs or medical assistants didn't introduce themselves when they came in to do a test on me.  When I received my discharge papers no one went over the prescription (side effects, how and when to take, etc.).  I'm not sure if this was because they knew I was in the healthcare field or not, but either way I would never hand my patients a prescription and then say, ""you're free to go.""  

It's never fun to have to go to Urgent Care but if you really need to, this isn't a bad place to go.  It's better than waiting 8 hours and clogging up a busy ER with flu-like complaints, and it's probably more beneficial to you than waiting a few days to see your doctor.

"Visited the Sayers Club and the other establishments inside SLS opening week.  It was a Monday night.  

We parked at 9:30 in the garage, after the valet said they were ""full"" with their hands out.  Valet was almost empty, and this new crew of newbies (admittedly not any of the few veterans of the industry I understand they did hire) was obviously hustling the property for $20 tips to park.  I'm not adverse to having a $20 option on a crowded night, but you drive past the valet lot on the way into the garage - empty.  This kind of thing tends to happen when the typical clientele is not tipping, and the valets want to park less and get paid more.  

We arrived at Sayers Club at 9:40 p.m. They had already done last call!

We walked through the bar and to the outside area.  It looks nicer from the street.  The design is disjointed and partially blocked off by other event space.  We got the canned speech about the 'battle of the bands' they plan to have as nightly entertainment.  Sounds like high school approach to what is billed as a sophisticated venue - no thanks.  And what's with closing at 9:30 on 'school nights'?  They told me they will only be open later Thurs, Fri, Sat.  What a joke.  

SUGGESTIONS:  

I've been here 45 years.  I worked at the Sahara 35 years ago.  I have friends who worked there when it closed, and work there now.  The PR says SLS is after locals.  Ok, let's get local then.

1.  No 'school nights' hours.  Stay open until at least midnight, better 2am
2.  Put a dress code in the club.  No slobs.  Grown men have no business wearing shorts into a restaurant or bar.  Get serious.
3.  No 'battle of the bands' BS, no 'dueling piano's' hustle.  Get sophisticated lounge singers and musicians which you will find at La Casa Cigar Lounge, The Barrymore, Zebra Lounge and others.  Not background music, but not loud either - sophisticated.  Grownups like to have conversations while we have a serious drink.  If you want serious bucks spent, don't cater to the mating rituals of the twenty-somethings.
4.  Iron out that patio deal.  Get rid of the gates or whatever that is and get some good seating out there, with no piped music unless there is no live music inside, and if you do pipe it in, make it sophisticated sound.

The slogan of SLS is ""Be Legendary"".  Sayers Club is the high end bar at the SLS, and is far from legendary.  

But it could be.  Opening week is tough, and there are always bugs to work out. I hope they step up.  I'd be back if they do.",1.0
"We came with a large group of friends for a birthday dinner.  We started with a sushi plate, which was great, and then I ordered the sea bass and my boyfriend ordered the black cod.  The black cod was very good, but there was something about the sea bass that I just couldn't get past - it tasted like perm solution, but I couldn't figure out why.  I passed the dish to my boyfriend, who immediately said it tasted like ammonia.  When we asked the waitress, she said another diner had the same comment on the dish, and that we just must not like the miso glaze on the fish.  Unfortunately, it wasn't until after we left and in talking with others \/ looking online that we realized the ammonia taste is a product of fish that isn't fresh.  Really?

"My best memory of Sky Harbor was flying into PHX from Houston on the famous record breaking 122 degree day back in June 1990. I'd been out here before a few times and this was the final move.

That day they actually shut down the airport since their temperature charts did not go up that high. They say hot air does not have the same lift and the planes could have trouble taking off and landing. Sounds like a lot of hot air to me.

It's easy to forget when they were only using terminal 1, 2, 3 and the fancy 4 was still on the drawing board. The airport was pretty outdated and needed a good facelift.

Sky Harbor has improved significantly over the years and it's really starting to show. The selection of trendy and tasty restaurants has grown to a number that almost gets me excited to go flying again. Nothing like a giant meal to keep you sleeping while you travel.

Usually fly out of terminal 4 when it's up to me. It is the newest of the bunch and much better than the others. Occasionally we will use terminal 3 when the boss is paying. I think he is a Delta fan or something.

TSA is about the same as any other airport. Not very friendly and pretty large to say the least. Once had one tell me how great the donuts were nearby and how in 5 minutes he was out of there and on break. Ok ... I know where he is going.

Get there early and kick back. It is fun to people watch or just play on your phone or tablet. I'm not a big fan of being in a hurry or stressing out. After all the plane could be packed. SNAKES ON A PLANE!

He came to see what the issue was, instead of just apologizing and moving on he argued with us and tried to explain how we were wrong and the food was seasoned fine and that he had never gotten complaints before.

"Restaurant review
In my quest to find good BBQ in Champaign outside of BlackDog which I still have not had a chance to eat at due to the long lines, I ended up at Bobo's with carry out. First the food takes a bit of time to prepare even though I was only 1 of 2 customers. I took heed to avoid the mac and cheese as it was reported to be similar to box mac and cheese. My sides were fries which are skin on potato fries, good not very crunchy but tasty and the potato salad which tasted like run of the mill potato salad. The corn bread was crumbly and dry so not so good. And on to the meats, pulled pork and beef brisket. There was not really any strong smoky flavor. The portion size was ridiculously small. For 13 dollars you can see how much food I got in the container. The only redeeming value was the delicious BBQ sauce. The chiptole peach and mild sauce were amazing BBQ sauce with a delicate balance of spiciness and sweetness. The only downside is you get only 2 small containers for the sauce. If you want any more you have to pay extra.

Pros: Amazing selection of BBQ sauce

Cons: Small portion size, expensive, not really good smoky flavors

"I did not know that this place existed, and sort of stumbled across it a few weeks earlier when I was looking for staycation options. After looking at a few places in Scottsdale and Cave Creek, I ended up booking a getaway at The Boulders over Memorial Day weekend as a birthday present for my girlfriend. She loves to travel, has done so extensively both domestic and international, but sometimes likes to just GET away for a few days without really GOING away.

Before I get into the meat of the review, I'll just say up front. 5 stars all the way -- Diamond in the desert. It seems from one or two other reviews that some people are surprised at the cost of this place once on property. When I think of Waldorf Astoria, I expect everything to be top notch and expensive. It's a premium brand. I cannot imagine how one would visit this resort with the expectation that on site dining, drinking and recreating would be ""cheap"". That said, given that it's a 1,200+ acre Waldorf Astoria resort, I was actually pleasantly surprised with the pricing, especially dining.  

As a local, the resort is less than an hour from home, so it was a no-brainer for that staycation to come to fruition. When we arrived, we were promptly met by a valet, who unloaded our bags while I checked us in. Upon check-in, I learned that valet parking was included in the nightly resort fee, and that most gratuities are also included in the resort fee so, for the most part, employees do not expect gratuities around the resort (although I couldn't help myself, and did insist on giving gratuities in most cases, as the service was just that good). A golf cart was waiting for us when we returned to the valet area, and our bags were already loaded in it. The bellman immediately whisked us away to our spacious Casita situated at the end of the #5 south green. He took the time to explain everything to us, unload our things and, since we were starving, he then carted us off to The Spotted Donkey Cantina, while pointing landmarks out to us en route. The nachos are massive and wonderful, fyi! 

Afterwards, we explored the expanse of the property on foot. A must do if you're up for it - very scenic. Later that night, we visited Palo Verde, where we had an amazing dinner.  We both had apps, entrees and desert, and it was all excellent.  I had the fritter app, followed by Bison medallions, and they were excellent.  Not at all gamey, and perfectly cooked. The Cowboy S'mores were for desert -- rich, chocolaty and...yum!  Wine bottle options from the $30s.  

After dinner, we took a short hike, still on property, up to Sunset Point and enjoyed a spectacular view of the nighttime desert, and the Scottsdale and Phoenix city lights off in the distance.  

When we travel together for leisure, one of the things we enjoy most about each other is that we both prefer having ""no agenda"".  We get up when we get up, and we do whatever we feel like doing. The Boulders made that easy.  On two mornings, we slept in and had brunch delivered to the casita. Situated literally 15 feet beyond the sand trap at the end of the #5 hole, our expansive, well shaded patio was the perfect place to enjoy a few hours of leisure. The food was delivered promptly and set up on our patio table for us. All excellent. The layout of our casita's patio, complete with double sliding glass doors, loungers, club chairs and tables, made golf watching interesting.  We could talk quietly while golfers finished up their rounds.  With a large full mesquite tree immediately in front left of our patio, we were a bit ""camouflaged"", so the golfers, not realizing we were there, were generally quite candid on the green.   It was fun and entertaining!   

Later, we visited the pool for the entire afternoon. Grabbing a couple of uber comfortable loungers, we enjoyed the desert setting, with boulder piles abound, and enjoyed a few adult beverages delivered by the pool wait staff.  What a great, relaxing afternoon. The pool and hot tub are 24\/7 btw, so enjoy whenever!

On our second trip to Palo Verde, for dinner that evening, we first stopped at Discovery Lounge for a cocktail, then again ordered apps, entrees and desert once seated on the patio (great views).  This time I had the chicken, and huckleberry pie desert and again, they were excellent.   We ordered a 2010 pinot noir off the wine list, but were treated to a 2008 vintage from the same vineyard at the same price.  

We ended up cancelling our spa visits for the next day just so we could continue to enjoy our patio!  Simple pleasures! You can be taken wherever you like on the property, with a few exceptions, by golf cart, or you can hoof it.  Next time, we'll visit the spa, and maybe play some golf too!

"Instructors that I have had previously (since I posted before) have now left. The only few instructors that I do like are Danielle, Lisa Virga and Diana. I feel as if the rest of the instructors have no idea what they are doing. I would be inclined to leave if I had not signed a two year contract for a price of $29.99 which you can't beat. The pricing is about the only good thing. The rooms are unclean, the toilets are always flooded, no hot water etc.

"I've been to Civello a few times... 

I'll start by saying that the service is good.  They do a good job on your hair, they're constantly checking up on you for coffee, etc., and the staff is nice.  I won't say really nice, because it depends on who you get.  Some people there aren't people-people and that's okay if you aren't paying a lot.  

But here's the thing - you do pay a lot!  So isn't great service, coffee\/drinks and extremely friendly staff expected?  They definitely don't go above and beyond what you pay for in my opinion - I actually would put them at a little below.  Here's why:

- The last time I went there, I didn't get a good vibe from the girl who was doing my hair (she just seemed like she didn't want to be there).  She was polite, but not necessarily friendly.  She seemed annoyed with my questions about the product she was using in my hair.  I can't remember her name or I would post it.  

- They don't let you tip with credit card - not a huge deal, but it's annoying.  If you want to be a top salon charging top prices, you shouldn't let stuff like that annoy your customers.  

- The front staff are nice, but definitely pretentious.  

- Yah, they give you this massage while you're getting a colour, but it's like 2 minutes long and it feels awkward, because the staff obviously don't want to do it.  

- They push the product on you when your service is done.  And usually I bought.  But Aveda products don't work well with my hair for some reason, so I can't justify buying them.

- Oh, and I notice that they seem to respond to the great reviews on Yelp by saying thank you, but don't address the ones where people have concerns.

Here are my concluding thoughts:  This place is too hyped-up.  I don't think they will screw your hair up, and if they do, they will probably fix it.  So yah, you can trust them and that's super important (you may even end up with awesome hair although mine was always okay).  But they definitely weren't great enough to keep me loyal to them.",1.0

"I had been looking forward to trying Jeremiah's Taproom. Since opening, there was a bit of buzz about how this bar had transformed it's previous incarnation, with American style food and a more modern (yet still classic) style.

So when my friends organised a New Year's Eve celebration here, with a three course dinner for £19.95, I was quite happy! My starter of prawn cocktail was really delicious, my venison burger main was also really good (and pretty much 90% of our party ordered it), but the bailey's cheesecake didn't taste of baileys at all. Just plain cheese really (not even vanilla). And we didn't get the coffee \/ tea and 'mint' specified on the menu. I did feel that for £19.95 this was quite pricey for a nice prawn starter and burger, and ok dessert. You'd maybe pay £15 on a normal night for these three things together.

The manager, Jane, was really quite wonderful. On the phone, beforehand, dealing with many different people in our party calling in to add themselves to the booking, and with their orders. And also during the night. A great laugh, and lovely host.

However, throughout the night some members of the bar staff were aggresively rude, without being provoked. I'm usually very tolerant of staff who are a bit stressed and perhaps not 100% on the mark, due to a busy night etc. And it being NYE, it was busy. But when my friend ordered drinks, and then was waiting for the price so he could pay, the bar tender came oer and without even telling him the amount, threw his arms out and said very loudly with a scowl on his face ""come on man, help me out here"" as if to say ""just pay already"" and we both hadn't heard him tell us the amount. That was just one incident of many. It's a busy night, yes, but it's NYE so be prepared to handle lots of people with at least a netural face, if not a smile. Certainly not a scowl.

Four dollars for a cup of frozen yogurt is expensive yet standard at the same time. It was a fairly large cup, and there was no tax so $3.99 actually was the price I paid.

"You have chosen to eat at a Japanese\/Chinese inspired restaurant...in a pyramid...on the Las Vegas Strip...at a resort.  Now that you've accepted that, we can move on to the review.

Like most, we used the food and drink voucher provided by the Luxor.  That means, after the savings, it costs as much as a regular restaurant.  But you knew that, because you're at a resort.

The overall layout and feel of the place is appealing and inviting.  The staff is top notch and really push this into solid 4 star rating.  Even the bus boy...err, man...was super polite and very attentive.  This is something I have come to expect from the MGM properties staff.

The Chinese dish (beef and noodles) was large portioned and decent.  The sushi was actually very good and very fresh, unlike some reviewers had found.  The Sapporro was huge, and it was expensive, but you expect that because it was at a resort in Vegas.

"Sorry, I see some ""rave"" reviews but this place was not even up to ""Dive"" standard for me.  I had been by this place, read reviews, was so excited to try it and finally got a chance to go in and eat...so excited...and then, SO DISAPPOINTED! Went there during a Diamond Back's game, no one in there except one gentleman sitting at the barstool waiting for his order.  Got in there around 1:12 p.m., and we didn't get our food until 2:20. So wanted to leave but we felt uncomfortable leaving when we had already ordered, I had waited so long to try it and we were the only one's in there for the last half hour...awkward.  We could not believe it took over an hour to get our food, AGAIN, we were the only one's in there for over a half hour! We ordered the chicken and it came with two sides and a piece of cornbread. The cornbread was so dry my 9 year old niece almost choked trying to force done a small bite.  I didn't believe her so I tried, it was so dry I put it down without finishing; note to restaurant, YOU CANNOT microwave corn bread back to life!  I will say this, I did finish it only because I was waiting over an an hour for food...it became a ""eat in hunger desperation"" thing.  

Once the food finally came, and AGAIN, still the only customers (that should have been my tipoff...UGH), it was not impressive.  The chicken was nothing special, nothing.  I make better at home.  The side of Mac n'Cheese was good and thank goodness something was good...not great, just good.  I had the green beans, again nothing worth remarking that another restaurant could not do.  I don't know if it was just because I was so hungry or whatever, I ate all my green beans and Mac.  Nothing spectacular, and nothing I will ever go back for.  

Service was horrible, they were not even ashamed of the crap service, didn't even bother to give us another piece of dry-arsed corn bread and only checked on us once.  I went, I ate and was NOT impressed.  

Go, judge for yourself.  Sadly, I know you will probably be disappointed.  You will have an appreciation for the expression ""Meh.""  They are over-priced and over hyped.  Glad I got it out of my system.  I could give them more than 1 star but that would be dishonest.",1.0

Comes with housemade bread and butter too. The pasty choices are numerous and we couldn't decide, so we started at the top with the original Oggie. Steak, potato and rutabaga in a pastry crust baled to perfection with a red wine sauce that pops nicely. One cup of soup and one pasty shared between us and we didn't have room for dessert.

"I lived here  a few years ago,  when it was great and safe place to live in. The staff was great and friendly. The floor plans were awesome.

"Pretty incredible hike for a place where there's no fee. Lots of people come here to hike or even run up this place. Parking can be very tricky due to the popularity of this place, even during weekdays, so be warned. Also, note that the first parking lot you see isn't the only parking available, there's more beyond it. My friend and I waited about a few minutes at the first one thinking there wasn't anymore, only to find  a parking spot right next to the beginning of the hike. 

We hiked all the way to the top, and it wasn't an easy hike. There's some intense climbs, but there are railings to help you, and most of the people along the hike were always lending a hand. I definitely recommend taking water, and maybe a light snack to eat at the top. But after about 45 minutes of climbing, you'll arrive at the peak, where you're rewarded with a great view of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale. We made it for the sunset, and it was just incredible. Definitely one of the best hikes I've done for a place that wasn't a national park. This is definitely a must do when you're in Phoenix.

"Out of the restaurants we ate at while visiting Vegas, this by far was our favorite.  We arrived a bit early to find out there is a lounge area on the top floor with somewhat discounted appetizers and drinks.  We had the beef medallions and short rib tacos.  The tacos were my favorite!

For dinner we ordered the 2 prixe fixed menus. My husband ordered the lamb and I ordered the gnocchi\/lobster\/filet steak.  The gnocchi I was not a fan of but the other courses were fantastic, especially the lobster.  Dessert was very good too.  Mine was the chocolate candy bar.  I prob would have chosen the chocolate soufflé though if that had been an option on the prixe fixed menu.  

The best parts of the meal was the view and the attentive waiters\/service staff though.  It is stunning up on the top floor of The Hotel.  When the sun went down it was a million dollar view.  I will post a pic because words can't even describe how awesome it is!

"I love the character of this place and AYCE Fish n chips Mondays! good selection of beers and definitely a spot to visit in Vegas. from the old school euro car parked outside to the White House that looks like it came from a fairy tale story but full with alcohol, beer and good food. it's a gaming bar but they have tables to dine in. they also have two dart boards in the back for friendly wagers but the highlight on my visit was the fish n chips. It was moist, flakey and crunchy batter with some steak fries. Rumor has it that they have some of the best chicken fingers so I might try those next visit. Try it out! You won't be dissapointed.",1.0
"This place is a complete run down pile with awesome wings. I read all the reviews and was aware it was in the middle of nowhere and was a dive but pulling up I did a double take lol. All of that does not matter though!

The bartender instructed me to get the original wings for my first tour. They are a combination of an awesome dry rub followed by a delicious buffalo sauce bath. You get about 12-14 crispy juicy carmelized deliciousness along with a huge thing of what seems to be homemade blue cheese and two celery sticks.

If anyone who has been to points east pub in Milwaukee for wings, this place is comparable. Spicy mouth watering wings with depth of flavor. I would say the most solid non-chain wing joint in the Madison area. I will definitely be back and I hope my food is just as delicious next trip.",1.0
"I wanted to love this place, especially since I live in the neighborhood and love a good blow out. However, I had a horrible first experience here and didn't even receive the blow out I booked. 

I emailed with the shop owner to try to book a blow out before I left for a wedding because I had just gotten off a transatlantic flight and was exhausted. The owner was very nice and helped me get a last minute appointment where I could be out the door by 1:00pm and on the road to the wedding - a two hour drive away. However, when I arrived (dirty hair and all), the receptionist told me they were running 45 minutes behind and it would be 1:00 before they could even wash my hair - even though she acknowledged she was aware of my time crunch. No one there even had the common courtesy to call me once they knew it was a problem so I could shower and do my own hair at home. By the time the whole ordeal was over, I had exactly 25 minutes at home to shower (again) and dry my hair. Blo single handedly ruined my day as well as my wedding morale.

We were very disappointed by Luxor! I did not see the resort fee mentioned anywhere when I booked it, so the 50 extra USD came out of nowhere. The room (Tower Deluxe King) was ok but nothing special, everything is very tacky and has a late 80'es plastic feel.

Evidently, we got there just at the right time - before the breakfast rush came. So, there was no issue getting a table in this tiny diner. I got the Spanish Open-Face Omelet since it sounded the most interesting.  I thought it lacked chicken in my opinion. But the salsa verde foam thing on top of my eggs was fairly tasty.

"DISABLED PEOPLE, PLEASE BEWARE

 I've been a patron of Cajun Queen for over a decade but my experience tonight was humiliating. I treated my sister to  a birthday dinner and despite our online reservation, we were asked to leave in  the most demeaning of ways. I have a debilitating childhood disease and use a wheelchair on occasion ; tonight was one such occasion. I could only order food I knew didn't require cutting, so I opted for potatoes and a salad. My sister ordered a full meal with wine. I had two mixed drinks (so we're not cheap diners). We had to signal for another glass of wine for my sister, despite seeing the party next to us being served appropriately. 

I'm not sure why we were overlooked but I'm left to wonder if it's the small portion I ordered that was disparaging.

Anyway, when my sister went to look upstairs a minute to reminisce, our server asked my sister quite off the cuff, ""Do you want help with 'her' (wheel)chair? I kinda need that table.""

Taken aback, my sister said, ""No."" 

We took note of the EMPTY tables on BOTH sides of us and the fact that the restaurant wasn't crazy busy as we remembered. 

I spent $67 on a tab for two  and left a TIP of $20--clearly more than twenty percent.

I don't know many people who tip as graciously as I  do. My reasoning for leaving the tip despite the service, was it being Christmas time and it's something I do for goodwill.

When we rolled to the handicap ramp, it was completely (I mean, completely) blocked off by an A-frame sign about parking; see for yourself. Had  my sister not been with me, I would have not been able to access the restaurant at all.

I haven't  always been disabled and ran a restaurant, myself (loved every minute of it). I know how people can take advantage (campers) and I know people can be uber-cheap at tipping. I don't fall into  either ilk. I know good service when I see it; I know how to approach diners who overstay their 'welcome (their can NEVER be anyone who overstay their welcome; consider it flattery); it's part of doing business and keeping patrons happy.  Take a loss here and there. 

We were in and HOME in a little over two hours. The couple beside us with the adorable little girl who  laid all over the booth was fine by me; she's a child and CQ is a noisy place.

I gave her the go-ahead.

At the end, she said it looked like she had gotten most of it. I took a quick look and it seemed like there were a few hairs left that I could pluck out. 

Then I went home and took a closer look, and I noticed that almost NONE of the hair on my legs had been actually pulled out--it had all been broken off at the base!

And also said that I was rude and and mean to his mother in the store. And that he lost three customers because of my visit. I know that I was very nice because I recorded the whole conversation.

"I rode this at night, assuming the lights of the Vegas Strip would be what really made it a worthwhile experience. But because of its lame back-alley location, the view is disappointing.

I don't understand why they built this where they did. The tourist frippery of the Strip is hidden from view until you get near the top, maybe 25% of the ride. The other 75% of the ride is spent staring at the ass-end of various dumpy hotel-casinos. I don't know about you, but a view of the Harrahs parking garage ain't worth $40 to me. 

If I were to ride again, I would go around sunset -- then you could at least see the mountains and stuff and the sunset during the boring 75% of the ride. As it was, I just stared into darkness peppered with thousands of suburban streetlights on one side....and the aforementioned parking garages on the other.

The one thing I did enjoy was the mechanics -- looking at the nuts and bolts and stuff holding everything together. From an engineering standpoint, it's fascinating....but in all other respects, this is an utterly boring ride. The HORRENDOUSLY lame video playing throughout the ride just adds insult to injury -- the actor in said video should be lashed to the exterior of one of the cabins and forced to spin around in slow hell for all of eternity, being pelted by the piss and vomit of a thousand Vegas hookers. UGH!

A better deal would be to spend your $40 on two cocktails at MIX, on top of the Delano...it has a much better view, and much shorter lines. (Although when I went, on a Sunday night, there was no line at all...so if you MUST waste your money on this ride, at least go on an off night).",1.0

"Really, I come here for the beer and the food is generally an afterthought. I have friends who are excited by their brunch and mac n cheese, but I find their food to be generally bland or oversalted. It's not bad, but not great. 

It's generic American with a little classy and a little trashy thrown in. For instance, they have a blue cheese mac, but they also have a cheesesteak-based version of ""shit on a shingle"" as a  brunch option. Their inspiration seems diverse. 

I was most recently there to try their brunch. The servers are usually friendly and ours was no exception. She was very new though, in the ""make many trips, forget drinks, don't bring a spoon to stir the coffee"" kind of way. Everyone's gotta start somewhere though, so we forgave the inefficiencies. However, when she brought out our meals piecemeal from the kitchen, my patience waned as my eggs cooled, waiting for the rest of my food to arrive. 

When it did, my ""shit on a shingle"" was filling, a good portion size, yet slightly too salty.  There wasn't enough gravy on the steak to actually cover the Texas toast and keep it moist. I had ordered scrambled eggs on the side to also eat with the gravy and not only were they only warm by the time my food arrived, they were also not cooked very well -- more like a fried egg that happened to have been stirred a couple times. The home fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. My dining companion liked the whole meal though, dubbing it ""so white trash"" and ""right up my alley.""

The mussels should have never left the kitchen @ half were inedible and way too salty, so it was graciously removed from the bill. Lots of sugar in the bread that was on the dry side.  The Balsamic dressing was odd in texture, tasty on the sweet side.
     Did not review the wine selection, the mixed drinks were over iced.

The courses were small enough that they were finished in minutes, and then the wait time between each was up to 30 minutes. 2 out of 4 got their coffee after the main was finished, but the other 2 only got theirs after they had finished dessert and sat waiting. This is ridiculous for a restaurant not at full capacity. The waiters changed during the meal and they seemed rushed and confused. The QPR here is seriously lacking, and lets be real, the food was often over-salted and mediocre. Seriously. Canned chickpeas in a salad and 1.5 cherry tomatoes.

The pizza was New York style with a thin crust, crisp at the edges and bendy at the tip.

I used to get the food for free when I visited their house but it's sooo good that I am totally willing to pay for the food. At least now, I can eat it whenever I want! I highly recommend trying this place. Even though Vietnam is a small country, food is very different from each province\/region. This restaurant offers the northern flavors from Hanoi unlike most of Toronto's Vietnamese restaurants which offer southern flavors. 

The MUST try = bun cha ha noi which translates to vermicelli with grilled pork. There's a bowl of grilled pork and pork sausage (made in house) in a bowl of milder tasting traditional nuoc cham (mixed fish sauce) served with a side of herbs, pickled daikons and carrots, and lettuce with a pile of vermicelli. You are supposed to add the vermicelli to the bowl of meat and sauce and dig in. 

Items that I swear by:
Pad thai with chicken
Bun mang vit (duck and bamboo noodle soup)
Mango salad 
Spring rolls (both vegetarian and pork versions - yeah you read right...they serve Viet style vegetarian spring rolls)

I visited just this past Wednesday to pick up an 8 piece dinner with two sides. Instead of hitting the drive thru and pissing a line of cars off with my large order, I decided to park and walk in to order. I walk in, make up my mind what I am going to get for sides and proceed to order my food. It wasn't overly busy, just a couple people ahead of me ordering and a couple diners eating. I order my food, get my receipt and that's when everything goes downhill.


The first thing I notice was what looked liked the manager\/supervisor (she was wearing the dark green button up shirt) is standing behind the counter by the tortillas and is straight out texting on her phone. Right there, in front of customers, on the floor. She then sets her phone down on the same counter, possibly on top of the bagged tortillas, and proceeds to start throwing tortillas in the plastic baggies. No gloves. No hand washing. 

I was thinking WTF but tried to ignore what I saw, scooped some salsa into to-go containers and waited for my order. I then saw that my cashier was now scooping my sides with no gloves and if she washed her hands, that was the fastest hand wash in history. She was helping other people behind me when I was at the salsa bar so I don't know how she could have quickly made it to the hand washing station, washed for 30+ seconds and go back to the side dish hot trays. 

I know fast food jobs suck and a lot of time the workers are treated like complete crap.

"This weekend's lunch was our third and final meal at Sunset & Vines.  They just seem to have given up.  The lady and I arrived just before 2pm - and the place was empty, save a venti iced tea sitting on a table by the window.  We were about to split when a woman slurping another starbucks drink materialized from the back, then slunk off to deliver the iced tea to a coworker.  I asked if they were open, because it looked like they weren't.  But they were, so I told my girl that I had rented out the entire restaurant for a romantic lunch.  There are tons of tables, but we were seated at the one in the corner that was totally broken.  Like, it would have taken 30 sugar packets wedged under the bottom broken.  We reseated ourselves.

Sinatraesque music is blaring in the place.  While perusing the menu (disappointed to find our previous favorite from our last visit no longer available) the music suddenly gives way to a raucous piano rendition of 'Walking In A Winter Wonderland'.  In May.  In 103 degrees.  That is one seriously jacked up Pandora station.  My girl got up to use the restroom (as she does every 22 minutes) and returned with a look of horror on her face.  No toilet paper.  Pee everywhere.  A filthy restroom in a restaurant that has zero business?  Sorry, you just don't care anymore.  You've lost your way.  Maybe grab a mop before you run out for a frappacino.

Two different servers tried to take our order - looks like tips were tough to come by that day.  In any event, I ordered the french dip.  Yawn.  Underseasoned, cafeteria-style sandwich with tons of horseradish on one half and none on the other.  You'd think if you had nothing else to cook, you'd put a little more attention to detail into something as simple as that.

The server\/manager\/owner guy has been previously dinged on these pages for a surly attitude.  Mr. Scowlypants was true to form, sulking about and failing to even acknowledge his TWO guests.  Again, if it's lunch on a weekend and I've got 2 covers and 2 covers only, I'm gonna put my heart and soul into making those people happy.

"The only place I'll stay in Vegas. Of all the casinos I've visited (Cosmopolitan included) this place has the most class. The decor is stunning. Lush red ceilings, gold chandeliers, and beautiful floral carpeting. Somehow  achieves the casino feel without bathing the room in darkness. The well-lit interior really lends itself to making friends (and good for them, staying up later gambling). Also, in my opinion, XS is the best of the Vegas clubs. Though XS is in the Wynn part, staying at hotel will get you reduced entrance to both before midnight. Go in, get stamped, then head back out to pregame\/gamble.

"They RUINED my ring...

I took an engagement ring here a few weeks ago to have the prongs changed from white gold to yellow gold. My husband and I initially ordered this ring from Blue Nile. It WAS a beautiful ring with a fancy yellow diamond. We felt my changing the prongs to  yellow gold to match the diamond it would make it more vibrant... The white gold prongs would wash the diamond out from certain angels.

When initially dropping off the ring they said it should take a week or less. After a week of waiting they said it would not be done till mid next week. At that point I decided I wanted my ring back and my husband went to get it... Well, they cut the entire center of the ring out (including the shank\/mounting, not just the prongs\/head - not what we wanted!). After almost another week (13 days total), we got the ring back. 

They had replaced the entire head with this big boxy thing that was almost double the size of the previous one. It looked way too big for the stone and did not go with the ring at all. The ring is uneven and the diamonds next to the center stone do not look secure. And now the ring does not fit with the matching wedding band that goes with it.",1.0

ALL IN FRONT OF SECURITY, WHO WALKED SLUGGISHLY TO US! They didn't even jog!!! And their response to us being attacked and robbed in front of them was to offer to write a report ""if we wanted to""!!! OF COURSE WE WANTED TO. And then they continued to try to talk us out of calling the Police, which we ignored and called ourself to file a report with the police.

"I appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the atmosphere very much, but this style of pizza is not really my thing. It's the very thin NY style, greasy, the cheese and toppings wanna slide right off. And though tasty, we got double pepperoni, which in my mind means the pepperonis should be pretty much covering the pizza and YES I realize that they were under the cheese but just not enough. Waiting for the pizza to cool down helped the topping slide problem a bit, but yeah not a big fan of crust this thin. For NY style though, they got it down pat, so that's why the 3 stars.

"I went to Graceland Automotive, but never got around to writing the review. To all of the people who suffered as I suffered, forgive me for not warning you sooner. I got caught in a snow storm on Christmas and had an accident. My insurance company, Geico, towed my car to Graceland for the body work. Unfortunately for me, I have a very nice sound system in my car. The person who worked on my car thought it was nice too, because the IDIOT turned the volume up high enough to blow out my speakers. When I dropped off the car, it was tuned to the CD player. I even went back to the car to get CDs out. So, I'm positive that the CD player was the last thing I accessed on my radio. When I picked up my car, it was tuned to an unknown radio station, and no sound came out of my speakers. Graceland Automotive swore that they never touched my radio and and that it magically changed to a local PA radio station on its own. Since I was not from PA, I had to drive home to VA with no sound and attempt to resolve the issue from there. Of course, Graceland Automotive refused to pay for the damage to my speakers, costing me over $400 in electrical repairs. They also managed to severely damage my steering column when they repaired the damage to the front of the vehicle. I had to send my car back to Geico to get additional repairs at a local shop in VA. These guys are shady, they do shotty work, cause additional damage, and then stick the customers with the bill. Moral of the story: DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR TO GRACELAND AUTOMOTIVE!!!!",1.0

The flavour  of the food is fantastic (albeit, I don't like the palabok) but the taste is very authentic.  The chicken is an acquired taste? What blasphemy is that?

"Worst experience ever- not just with vehicle service, with any transaction to date.  If there was an option for no stars I would have chose that.  Had an appointment for state inspection, wiper blade, and oil change.  Showed up and Chris in service explained that he didn't have my appointment for the inspection and wasn't sure if they would have time.  I explained that I had made arrangements for someone to pick me up because I had the appointment made. He then said well, let me check to see if I can fit you in.  I had an appointment so fitting me in shouldn't have been an issue (later he admitted that I did have an appointment for the inspection).  He then asked me for my registration and insurance, I have a company fleet vehicle so everything comes from them. He didn't like the way the national company had registered the vehicle and made a comment about that.  I could not locate the current insurance card, and wanted to call to see if we could get the updated card sent. Chris didn't have a fax machine and only would accept an email which was fine. I called the insurance company and hey couldn't send the new card until Monday.  I simply asked Chris if the inspection could be performed and have the sticker held until Monday.  Chris preceded to yell at me in the office in front of other people, tell me he didn't need more want my business and told me to leave.  On my way out, I began to cry which usually doesn't happen, but I have never been treated that way. The gentleman in the car bay asked me what happened and I started to tell him.  Chris aggressively came out to my car window and asked me if I had a complaint, he said leave we don't want your business.  I said that's fine I'm still calling your manager, he said he was calling my manager as well.  Again, Chris showing his level of education which I would I guess might not even include a hs diploma.

Our second choice turned out only to be a lunch place, now closed for the evening. A pub crowded with students did not appeal. We decided to try Kismot since it was next door to the noisy pub. Although without a reservation, we were seated immediately. Having only a hour before the concert we wished to attend, we ordered only one dish to share plus two kinds of naan. The garlic coriander naan arrived fairly quickly. It tasted only mildly of its toppings. The cheese naan arrived with our main dish and was really delicious. Finally the main dish arrived. It was a revelation: chocolate massallam. This was the most amazing thing I tasted during the ten days we spent in London and Edinburgh. It didn't taste exactly like chocolate, but had a rich flavor so unexpected and delicious that after Jeremy left to the concert, I stayed behind to finish every bit of it. One caveat: this does not come with rice. If desired, rice must be ordered separately.

I told our server we'd be back every day to sample more of their menu but sadly, that was not to be. Returning to Kismot will be a top priority next time I'm in Edinburgh.",0.0
"Most Yelp events are pretty casual laid-back affairs, but this one was a bit of a departure from the norm. Then again, Capital Grill isn't exactly a laid-back casual kind of place. They do classy, they do it well, and they were at the top of their game for this event. 
While I really try to like wine, I'm super picky and my tastes lean towards the very sweet. Even so, I had a great time trying out these different wines. The riesling was my favorite of the night, but my favorite pairing was the scallop risotto with the chardonnay. They really did compliment each other well and I'm pretty sure I could eat a whole plate of the risotto. Of course, with the red wine course came red meat, and lots of it. Waygu carpaccio seasoned with anice that had me almost licking my plate. The dry aged sirloin and chimichurri sauce pretty well convinced me to come back and try their lunch plates, and the filet was awesome. I got the sense that a few of the people at our table didn't like all of the rare\/raw meat, but it was totally fine with me.
The atmosphere and service were top notch, and we had a great time at this event. Thanks Capital grill!",0.0

Honestly, our fave is their oysters!  $1 oysters (on the half shell or steamed) during happy hour.  And they have respectable wings too.

"We came to this Outback to have a bit of normal among the myriad of new foods we had in Vegas. We love Outback at home and so we thought we would go get food we know we love. This location doesn't have the same menu as others. We love the chicken artichoke flat bread and couldn't get it here. Not enough room to store all of the ingredients? Ok. I can understand that. Vegas is compact and I don't know what else they use artichokes for. 

However, what I don't understand is being told that they aren't offering the current Outback promo of Steak and Lobster for $14.99 but we can get a steak and add a lobster tail for a total of $35 instead. AND being told that other locations in Vegas and on the strip do offer the promotion doesn't help. So I'm not sure if this location is just cheap or what.

Our waiter also had a bit of an attitude when we expressed our disappointment by the lack of our favorite offerings. He took about 20 mins to bring out our bread and we only saw him a few times during the meal. He was much happier serving other guests.

As for the prices, fairly reasonable for a resturant on a university campus, and the service was smooth, we had a very cheerful young girl who was very attentive and everything came quite quickly and we were able to get in and out within our lunch break which isn't always easy, especially at a dine in establishment.

"Considering the 3 star rating says ""A-OK,"" I will definitely agree with that. Brio really is a decent place to go for some Italian. I have had mostly their pastas ranging from their lasagna to their ravioli. You really cannot go wrong with these pastas as they should not be that difficult to make. I also will compliment them on their bread before appetizers. I enjoy sourdough so that is my bias, but they also have these crackers that are quite a treat.

The gem is the sweet potato waffle, naturally sweetened by the sweet potato, it is both healthier and tastier than any waffle I have eaten.. The service is fantastic. When an error was made, they were quick to fix it. They also made sure I did not pay. Terrific food at a fair price, where they make you feel at home. Highly recommended.",0.0
"This place was our first stop for our weekend vegas getaway. The ambience was good, low light, not a lot of energy so it was a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the vegas casino floor. Service was mediocre but the food was delicious. I had the combination of tacos; carne asada, chicken and carnitas. The carnitas taco was my favorite with pickled red onion, chopped orange, and the moist and tender carnitas. The chica got a trio of carne asada tacos which were delicious. The only had one corn tortilla for each taco so you weren't getting a mout full of tortilla each bit. Each plate came with rice and beans ehich weren't bad but nothing to brag about. Salsas were good and the chips were airy and not heavily drenched in oil. ***WARNING- they charge $3 for chips and salsa*** but they don't tell you when they say, ""we'll be right back with your drinks, and chips and salsa"". I'm not gonna cry over three bucks in Vegas but hidden charges irk me, and no it's not even on the menu.

I moved back from California to Arizona and was bored with the going to the regular gym and after I felt like my shoulder was semi-ready, I needed to find a CrossFit gym that would be willing to help me into transitioning back.  I hit up DTP on Facebook and they invited me in for a workout.  I couldn't believe how sweet and encouraging everyone was to me--both the coaches and it's members.  One thing I've learned about doing CrossFit is that you don't compete against others, you compete with yourself and the others are there to cheer you on to finish no matter how crucial the workout. After my first workout, I knew I was in, just had to think about it. The homie Tom (one of the coaches) reached out after about a month and asked if I was ready.  The fact that he was nice enough to reach back out and not forget about me showed that this was the place for me.  I've been at it for almost two months and I'm getting stronger than ever.  Ali is the bomb dot com, she'll get you in line which I definitely like, I don't want someone to just tell me what I wanna hear.

"Love coming here!  It's nearby and convenient....I've read all the other reviews by other patrons and (my opinion) they are just being EXTRA sensitive! 

Everyone is friendly and attentive!  Tweety is AMAZING at her craft!  She is always booked so make sure you call and make an appointment.  The prices are moderately priced..... I'm sure you can go somewhere else and get it cheap BUT THEN AGAIN you get what you pay for ((IF you know what I mean!)) 

Regular set of nails are like $25, but go for the gel $40...they last longer and they are done RIGHT!!! 

Their spa pedicures are ON POINT!! Those hot stones mixed with the massaging really relax you. 

Bottom line... I've gone to other places but I am faithful to this place here!  It's so much better now that I've built the relationship with the owners and the workers as well.  They know what you like, and how you like it! So DON'T go off the crappy reviews others have posted... You need to go in with an open mind, a good personality, and the ability do take a joke!

"Beach Foodland is an awesome supermarket and it's unfortunate that it's further away from my home than ValuMart. I've been here a few times and usually I stop by whenever I'm looking for something specific that I know I won't find on any other supermarket or grocery store in the Beach. The store carries the kind of nice and unique food (such as certain Swiss chocolate that aren't well known here in TO) that I've only found in one other place: the St Lawrence Market. 

I like the variety of products (and some quite unique), the prices seem to be on par with ValuMart (the only other supermarket option in the Beach) and the staff is nice enough. If there's one negative thing about the place it's how dark the aisles are... I'm not sure if it's because the shelves are so tall, the lights not bright enough, the colours too dark or perhaps a combination of all these things but they'd certainly benefit from some renovations to bring and give the store a more up to date look and feel.",0.0
Meh. I've had better. Not very authentic and the broth was mediocre. I asked for the Tonkatsu spicy and they seasoned it way too spicy. Not to mention the charsiu tasted very old. Still on the hunt for a real ramen noodle house in the valley!  Very disappointing.,0.0

This new location is still very central and the service was as friendly and helpful as the first BB... great to see consistency, and a second BB was needed based on the popularity of their first.

"I am excited aobut the larger menu choices now.  I asked two employees when that happened and neither of them knew.  I am guessing very recent. My burger was very good.  Next time I will order it medium rare.  It was too well done for my taste.  I asked for hot fries and I got them.  My daughter was disappointed with the pretzels and beer cheese.  We told the waitperson that there was something wrong with the cheese.  Beer cheese is usually orange and very creamy.  It cost $7 too.  It was pretzel bites.  The cheese was whitish and watery and tasted like salad dressing.  Looked like ranch to me, without the garlic.  My daughter said it was awful.  When I tasted it, I knew something was wrong with it.  It was REALLY bad...tasteless and watery...no taste of cheese or beer whatsoever.  The waitress did not appear to believe me or offer to replace it...that was surprising.  She should have insisted on bringing another bowl or comping it.  I felt bad because my daughter ordered appetizers instead of a meal.  Happy to see appetizers and other sandwiches now on the menu.  Always associated Goldies with burgers, wings, and pizzas.  I will come back and try a sandwich.",0.0

"Wow, what a supreme let down. Sure they serve beer fine. But I went there for the love of Irish food as they claim. The lamb pie was absolutely terrible. Almost all dough, very few bits of lamb, and absolutely no flavor. zip, zero, nada. What are they thinking? Do the chefs ever try the food they serve?

To top it off, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. sounds delectable, right? Wrong! Completely raw baby spinach and canned mushrooms that have been drained are not at all appropriate or tasty complements to a well cooked lamb pie. but it all tasted bland, so at least they are consistent.

they should actually cook the spinach and use fresh mushrooms. the mushrooms were actually cold!!

either cook it right (ok to raise the price a little if you actually serve a tasty meal), or don't bother serving it. In a lamb pie, the signature ingredient is the LAMB... not the dough!!",0.0
This was our  first time here. It was better than we expected.  The prices were reasonable.  We were here during happy hour so wine was only $4 per glass. Our food was good.

"We heard today from my son who wife and he dined at the resturant Sat. evening about 7:30 pm. Work all day and get a chance to go out to sit down once or so a month and come away with less than expected dining.experience. We watched the kids to give them a chance to relax. 
I asked if the resturant was busy and he says it didn't appear to be. The problem is the Fajitas which come, as he says on a platter with the fixings and a separte hot plate with the meat on one end. The meat wasn't hot and sizzling like it is suppose to be but luke warm. He should have sent it back but they were too hungry at that hour and just wanted to eat. I find fault with the server as this stuff should be put up to serve hot and if left on the bank to be picked up too long it isn't the kitchens fault. Like I said, he said it wasn't busy so the server must have been busy doing social things. maybe posting or catching up. But no reason to serve a dish on a cast iron plate if it isn't searing hot. 
Don't get me wrong here as I have good reports from my wife who she and friends love  Zs.. i have never been there and i like my food served HOT. Zs just lucky it was my son and not me as you got a pass this time and a pass ain't that greeat. .",0.0

Then I wanted to have something to put my ketchup in so I could dip my tots in and two girls smiled at me but never asked me if I needed something and even walked past me a couple times, until the cashier finally ""saw"" me and asked what I needed and even when I said in a chipper way ""thank you"" she just looked on zombie like. My fiance wanted a refill on his regular sized drink (coke) and was charged $0.86 which is really ridiculous! If they wanted to they could just refill the cup instead of providing a brand new one....

When I informed them of this I didn't even get an apology, only an excuse that they were really busy and my pizza went out on someone's delivery.  They didn't even offer to fix the problem until I showed up with the wrong pizza and requested the right pizza, to which I was rudely told, ""Well, you're gonna have to wait.""  Which is what I'm doing right now, although the kitchen staff seems too busy with their phones.  Unbelievable.  Never again.  And I asked for no peppers on my salad.

First, the pedicures are thorough, but I end up bleeding on the bottom of my feet every time because he does not know how to remove the callous correctly. Second, on my nails, they do a good job but it is less expensive to get a full set than a fill of pink\/white! So, a full set of pink and white once a month? I don't think so... Last visit, Linh was on the phone chatting in Vietnamese when I sat down until I finally interrupted her to tell her I wanted my nails cut down 20 minutes later. She was a little pissy that I interrupted her phone conversation and drilled the side of my fingers 2 times in the next couple minutes. I got up and left with unfinished nails.

One of the highlights for me was the courtroom where actual trials were held for the mobsters.

"There was a swarm of bees under the roof of my house between the eves cover and the roof.  I called the BeeKeeper at 4:00 pm.  They said they would be out within 1 hour and a 2 story house would be no problem.  They quoted a price of $155.00.  I instructed them to come right out.  BeeKeeper arrived approximately one hour later, so far so good.  The serviceman was clean, friendly and presentable.  He confirmed the extermination price of $155.00 saying there would be an additional charge for removal and repair.  I gave him the go ahead.  He sprayed the nest area that is obscured by the soffet covering.  When he was finished spraying, the BIG up-sale began.  He said there would be a charge for hive removal and house repair.  The quoted price was $490.00 for removal AND $490.00 for repair.  These outrageous prices could have been disclosed during the confirmation period.  I asked whether there was a warranty and what would happen if I left the hive as is.  He said there is NO warranty without removal and that the bees could return if no hive removal.  I obviously said NO to his quote saying I could pay for many bee exterminations at the up-sale price.  I recommended just sealing the access area to the bees but that was not of interest to him.  I plan to use simple screening to close off this access and save myself a Grand ($1000.00).  To sum it up, the foot in the door moves were graded and ""A"", however the up-sale tactics failed the overall experience.  I suspect this is a common tactic with many of these businesses so my best advice is to not act hastily and make an informed decision.",0.0

I love me some margaritas. The spicy pineapple margarita was my choice tonight and I had that to enjoy while looking over the menu. Finally decided to have the steak torta, carnitas taco, chips and ranchero guacamole. 

There was no stagnant wait time to place my order as the bartender was very attentive despite the semi crowded bar. It was about give minutes later, boom, my chips come out. The chips are a crunchy kind of good. There are three kinds of guacamole in which I ordered the chunky spicy kind. It was a perfect accompaniment with my drink and anticipation for my meal. 

Before I can get halfway down my drink and just as I got over the chips, tada... Here comes my food. The timing couldn't be any more spot on. 

The steak torta was very tasty. It was seasoned and moist with the toasted bread just crisp. The sandwich was pretty darn good. On the plate were also potato wedges that came with aioli dip. Without the dip, the wedges were.. meh. It's all about that dip. 

Done with my first drink, I gave the bar tender a nod and boom another one came. Completed my steak, on to my taco. The carnitas or pork, was a bit dry and it was just ok. Following the steak, it wasn't great. Finished it anyway, dipped it in the guac and poured salsa on it. That did the trick. 

Munched on the chips some more as I wrote this review. 

The environment is clean, friendly and inviting. The wait staff is awesome. The food is great. And the prices are reasonable. The music is trendy and relatively current. 
I would come back here again for sure.

Do Not come here!! The service is so poor. The food is so so. Not great. When this place first opened the manager then was pretty nice and food was better then too. This time I went back there are new managers there and there are very little customers. We went during peak time around 12:30 for dim sum. Anyways the reason why I don't recommend is that one of the managers sat down to talk to us and he stuck a pen inside his ear and started picking the inside of his ear and then flicked it on the floor. I looked at my family and quickly ended the conversation and left. It was disgusting and not professional at all. His shirt was suppose to be white but instead it was surrounded in black and grey dirt round his wrist and collar. The place was pretty much empty and food was not great and service needless to say was atrocious. Any wonder the place is so empty.,0.0

I took my Mustang in Monday because it would not start.  Patrick promptly connected his test equipment and ran several test.  He verified the fuel pump was not working.

What I like about Subway is the ability to actually see the food in front of one as it is placed on the sandwiches.  This is a customer-driven quality control feature.  One can see the product, see how it is made, see the level of cleanliness\/hygiene, see if gloves are put on and\/or changed.... So, from fresh materials in front of one to a sandwich that is either cold or heated -- one can see the entire process.  Frankly, the Subs are healthy compared to the oil ladden products of other ""fast food"" places.  My experience with staff has been they've been friendly and helpful in all instances.

"Another 1-star review for this IHOP.
After we were seated, 5 minutes went by until a waitress came by to tell us she'll be with us shortly. Then a couple minutes later she takes our order. 10 minutes after that our drinks come. 20 minutes after that, some of our food comes with one dish missing. Then waitress comes and says the cooks screwed up and just started making the entree (veggie omelette, hold the tomatoes and mushrooms). As the rest of our family finishes half their breakfast, the veggie omelette comes to our table WRONG: with tomatoes... And no side fruit. Just the measly omelette with half the plate bare. $11.99 for that? 10 minutes later, the order comes correct to our table... And waitress realizes that the fruit side was given to another order and they forgot to include pancakes on another order on the table.
To sum it up, the meal was not worth the price even with the manager comp'ing the wrong entree.

The owner knew and I asked for a discount and she insisted that its a white color gel. I was upset as a regular customer. But the price is not that bad of a deal. The $15 regular manicure and $20 gel manicure. I think their price for acrylic full set is $15. Best to call for update prices.",0.0

I was excited that someone would deliver Thai food.  Phoenix delivery  has a lot to be desired I live 1.5 miles from the restaurant I ordered beef panang   Thai hot and some spring rolls.a half hour went by and received a call telling me I did not meet there $25 minimum and would need to order more. I told them i did not see that on the menu or I missed it because the menu is not phone friendly. I said I am one person and don't eat that much so just cancel the order.  She said it's already cooked I asked why no one mentioned it she said he is new. I said I understood and that happens. she would do it this time but next time no. It seems like she thinks she is doing me a favor. The food arrived the delivery guy was very nice however my food was in a grocery bag and cold. Again under 2 miles away. The rolls were bland and unexciting. The rice was dried out and clumpy. The meat was dry way too much liquid and the flavor was like a red pepper not hot even a little bit. The portion was small. ( I am not a big guy)I was still hungry so I made a salad. The woman that called me assumed there would be a next time and she is wrong. $20 seemed high for what I received. If it was great would have paid $40. I will stick to picking up wild tiger for $12 I can have dinner and lunch the next day with no attitude.,0.0
"We had an early flight which got us to the hotel around 9am, but the nice gentlemen at desk let us check in at that time and even let us have late check out time at 2pm with no extra charges unlike hotels on strip that charges you for everything. I requested a room facing pool after reading tips. Worth the view as the other room views aren't much to look at. We got a room with 2 queens for $61 a night (including tax\/resort fee through Priceline). The bathroom was a bit small and television was still a boob tube (I'm not much of a tv watcher anyways). I guess you can't have everything, I was satisfied.. Bass store is huge and neat. The Aquarium was awesome to see. If you get there at certain times you'll be able to see the mermaid and the scuba diver feed the stingrays. We really enjoyed that. There's a free shuttle from airport to hotel and free shuttle from hotel to Caesars Palace. It was about $20 for a taxi ride from NY NY hotel back to Silverton. If you want the same Vegas feel with restaurants, gambling, and shopping w\/o the crowds, Silverton is perfect for you. If you need last minute things, Target is a mile walk down the road along with other stores\/fast foods. I would stay again.",0.0

"We first went here with friends for half price tacos.  I had shrimp tacos and grits.  I had never had a shrimp taco before and it was just divine!  There were two tacos, dressed with cabbage and a spicy pineapple salsa.  I do not eat grits, but thought I'd give these a try because of the cheese and jalapeno in them.  These grits are to die for!  They are creamy, cheesy and have just enough kick to be a little hello in your mouth.  The service our first visit was a bit show, even though we were the only guests there.  We were all out of beverages so I walked up to the bar to request refills and reorders.  The owner was standing there and completely flipped his lid, screaming and yelling at staff who were out back smoking.  LoL. The service for way better, even though I was mortified!  Since then, we visited almost weekly for a variety of foods and great drink specials.  The good is always fresh, the flavors and good are consistent and enjoyable, and the service had been well above average.  If you're looking for a really casual place with an outdoor eating area and a separate outdoor bar.  This is the place!

"I went into this location to make a deposit, The Teller was so rude and this is not the first time I have been treated rude by this Teller. She was too busy picking at her fingers to continue counting my cash.

I told her it doesn't matter until she is finished with the count.  She just looked at me like I was the scum of the earth, I told her she didn't need to be rude and I wanted to speak to the Manager, She called the Manager to come over, The Manager asked what I wanted the teller told her I said she was being rude and the Manager told her to tell me she was busy.

"Yard House is one of my favorite spots for happy hour - the food is delicious and oh so affordable, and the service is always friendly. I frequent the Chino Hills location when visiting my sister, and the Marina del Rey location is a recent favorite due to their proximity to my job. On my recent trip to Las Vegas, I got to check out this location, which is in the new Linq complex on the strip. I didn't get to eat at this location, but we visited the walk-up bar our first night in town (7\/1\/14) to try what has become my favorite Vegas drink: FROZEN. MOSCOW. MULE. I don't usually go for frozen drinks and was going to order mine on the rocks, but watched the bartender make one for the folks ahead of us in line. It looked so good and it was about 100 degrees at 10 pm so I decided to go for it. Oh my....the best $10.50 plus tip I spent in Vegas! So good that my sister and I returned to the Linq our second night in town (7\/2\/14) specifically for this drink! I wish I could remember the names of the bartenders because they were both awesome - there was a male bartender 7\/1 and a female bartender 7\/2.

Sehr zufrieden, werde wieder mit meinen Kollegen und mal Abends mit der Familie hin gehen.
Bedienung
Die Bedienung war viel besser wie ich hier in einer Kritik gelesen habe. Bedienungen sind auch nur Menschen und sind nicht jeden Tag gleich wohl auf wie wir alle. Also ich war mit meinen Arbeitskollegen dort, wurde sehr rasch uns freundlich bedient (allerdings) waren nur 6 Tische belegt.

"Can I give this place no stars? I went here years ago to tan for my prom (2009). I only went there because I worked across the street, and it was convenient. It was the first place I had ever gone tanning. I will never go back. Not that I tan much, anyway. 

The man who runs it is one of the creepiest people you could ever meet. Just having him look at you is enough to make you uncomfortable. It's not a very professional atmosphere. It's pretty grungy, outdated, and unclean. I am very fair-skinned and burn easily. All I wanted was a little color for my senior prom. I would ask for 7 minutes. Maybe ten if I was feeling adventurous. More than once they had turned the bed on for 20 minutes in would only realize after it was too late, and I was definitely burnt beyond belief. I then started setting my own timer on my phone for the correct time. I only kept going there because I had a package.

"The wait wasn't quite at the end of the winding ropes, but it was close and it took us about an hour to get through it, paid and to a table. It looks new and is designed well. There is a friendly staff to make your dining experience its best. The options in this buffet were immense. They have 11 separate buffet areas. I wish I had room to make my own stir fry, but I was too full from the 3 buffets I had within the 24 hours prior to this one to finish off my Buffet of Buffets. 
I started with a salad because I had been eating too heavy lately. They had a multitude of green options (iceberg, romaine, spring mix and spinach), and a decent array of toppings and dressings. Everything looked fresh. I also had a cup of the chicken noodle soup, which was flavorful and hearty.
I had a plate of snow crab legs, and the server noticed quickly and brought me a tool to get into the legs with. They were cooked right and had a good flavor to them. Their lasagna was wonderful. It was the right amount of gooey cheese, a perfect amount of  sauce and a balanced amount of meat. Utterly delicious. 
One of the only downsides to this restaurant is that nothing was labelled. You had to guess what everything was. Even if things are changing and rotating, there should still be a label.
The dessert bar had a large number of options for gelato\/sorbets, and pies. I was too full for a pie (although, the cherry pie was calling my name), but I got the orange cream sherbert (I'm half guessing on the type of ice cream). It reminded me of the flavor of a Push-Up ice cream. Creamy and light, it was the perfect end to my meal.

I would definitely recommend this restaurant to someone else. It was worth it to be a part of the Buffet of Buffets pass. I saw that this is $33 per person to enter without the pass. I would recommend the Bellagio over this one, if I were paying outright, but it's good for the deal.",0.0
"Horrible service!!!!!!  I went there with a friend on New Year's Day at 9am and restaurant wasn't full. We were greeted and seated in a very timely manner, than it all changed.

Another party of 5 was seated couple minutes after us and they had drinks (coffee and etc) already on the table and the server was taking their order, while we sat their with our water.  There were other employees walking around as no one took our drink order.  I know servers have stations but what about taking care of the guests, is asking someone to take our drink order that hard.

Hakkasan charged our cards, but the money was not debited from our account until 19 DAYS LATER (26 March).

This is by far our most fave place to get pizza. We've been here dozens of times over the years. Their special salad with cheese and pepperoni with their own dressing is a great start before the pizza comes out.

Bring your own bottle wine if you want to drink with no corkage fee, food was fantastic with my steak cooked perfect, desert selection is good.  The service was good right up till the end. After paying for an $70 meal, not including alcohol, the server questioned the amount of tip I left. For starters tip is optional and second I decide how much to leave not the server.  I was told it is customary to leave 15% tip and questioned as to why I did not. If I did it again...zero tip!  I would have have a 4 star rating but the top issue left a sour taste in my mouth. I would not return to this restaurant when so many other great restaurants are in the area.",0.0

"The place has a fast-food dining ambience to it; they didn't invest too much on tables and chairs. I order the dumplings which tasted okay, but they were swimming in oil.

The waitress confused our tea orders,but no matter,had the green tea instead ( the new ""health food""). Another keeper.",0.0
Was here last night for a bachelorette party.  We had pre-selected our dinner items but I decided to order a round of drinks for our table of 10-- big mistake as this took over 30 minutes for them bring our drinks out and when they did they only brought 9.  I immediately let our server know and it then took an additional 20 minutes to get the other drink after we had already 30 minutes and for them to not bring enough is unacceptable.  These drinks were to have been for our dinner toast which they now ruined because by the time the last drink was brought over everyone was done eating.  When I complained to both the sever and a manager they told me they would see what they could do but the delay was because they only had 1 bartender.....the manager sent over green shots for our table and proceeded to charge me full price for our 10 cocktails at $14 per drink.  At $140 bucks our drinks should have all come out at the same time and not taken 40 minutes---epic fail and total buzz kill will not return.,0.0

"If I could give them no stars I would! I bought their groupon, and called them several times to schedule an appointment. They never returned my calls. Then when I finally got an appointment scheduled they cancelled it the day of only two hours before the appointment time. The only day that they could do it was the day before we were moving out of state. They came, did the car, I tipped him $20 and then I never looked inside until after my car got shipped to WA. When I saw the job he did I was furious! It was disgusting! The interior that he had wiped down had soap scum, he hadn't moved any of the seats to clean around them or under them, and the cup holders were filthy! (We had just bought this vehicle from someone off CL which is why I wanted it detailed in the first place.) When I called the owner to ask for a partial refund he was curt and said that we should have inspected it, and he wasn't responsible. I told him that I thought that it was ridiculous that he as a professional detailer and business owner should have to be told how to do their job. He said that I was just bitching over dirty cup holders and insinuated that I was just being cheap. Long story short, the job was terrible, and the customer service was even worse. Luckily, Groupon refunded my account for it. I have a feeling, though, that karma is going to hurt this company! Save your time and money and DO NOT use this company!

"What a lovely surprise! This was our delayed Valentine's Day dinner and it was fantastic!  We were greeted by the owner, Martin, who was very nice & hospitable.  I was a little worried because it was close to 6 and we were the only ones there.  I had no need to worry.  The folks started coming in steadily after that.  Our waitress was delightful & knowledgeable.  We both started with a Goat Cheese Salad that had walnuts & white beets.  Very good! My husband also had a terrific Shrimp Bisque soup.  Savory broth & lots of shrimp.  As an entree I had their special Dover Sole that was deboned at the table.  A perfectly cooked and beautifully presented filet served with a lemon\/butter sauce on the side to complement it.  My husband had a very tasty Beef Bourginoune (?).

"I have been a big fan of rob gentile's Buca empire (includes bar buca and buca on king west). This place is tucked away in a condo building next to the chic four seasons hotel in yorkville. Reservations are hard to come by easily, earliest available table on tue night was at 10 PM. When we walked in, the place was absolutely buzzing with activity. We sat in front of the open kitchen which was a fun experience. This osteria focuses more on seafood but some of the dishes are prohibitively expensive. We ordered the GNOCCO FRITTO with swordfish n'duja and the PUNTARELLE salad. The squid ink dumplings were soft and warm but did not pack a punch from a flavor perspective. The chicory was bitter in the salad but the pesto held it together.  We also ordered the RAVIOLI DOPPI - double-stuffed lobster filled pasta, sweet corn, ragu di mare, lobster bottarga, uncinato truffle. I love truffles but talk about wasting such a high quality ingredient on a dish. There was really no truffle flavor and for the price we paid this dish felt like a waste of money. We shared a pizza as well - SALSICCINE - cured spicy sausage, virgin mozzarella, bariole olive, testun di barolo cheese. Although I liked the crust, the flavors were not a hit with my palate. We were encouraged to order a dessert so we went for zeppole with pistachio cream. Honestly, this did not excite me too much except for the pistachio cream. This place definitely caters to a well heeled yorkville clientele but also maintains a sense of humility with the service. I definitely prefer the king west digs to this location.",0.0

"I've been to Guido's three times for lunch. I've had a burger and fries all three times, all were cooked to perfection and really tasted great. The first time I went alone as I work nearby. I expected the experience to be pleasant, if not speedy, as I was on a short lunch break. For some reason, it took a while to get the burger and fries. The waitress was accommodating and polite, but it took way to long - like 30 minutes before I had the food. 

Second and third meals there were all great experiences with less trouble than the first. The burgers are really good and the fries become awesome with the queso added.

"I tried Vera's because a good friend of mine recommended the place and was pleased with their service. I went in for a fill and pedicure. The nail tech was very nice, but there were issues. First, she filed the side of one of my nails so hard it cut the skin, when I said ""ouch!"" she quickly put nail glue on it. So I had raw skin with nail glue attached. I explained it hurt and she tried to fix it, but damage done. Too many layers of gel were also placed on my nails. My usual place does two coats and 60 secs under the UV light. This tech kept asking me to put my nails under the light 4 and 5 times. Way to excessive! My nails are not as thinly painted as I'd like. The pedi was okay, but I was burnt with first the hot rocks then the hot towel. A lot of pain associated with this visit - I will not be back! The total time for both services was also 1 hour 45 minutes. My other place can do both in 1 hour. I just don't have the time, nor patience for discomfort when getting nails done.",0.0

"Having read the reviews lamenting the line time and decrease in food quality, I reluctantly agreed to make the drive down to the M this weekend.  We went at an off peak time (2-3pm) on a Saturday but there was no line!  Winning!  It was pricey at $86 for two of us after tax.  The crab legs are a popular draw, they are now split for your eating like a machine convenience.  I am starting to agree that, despite the decrease in work, the split legs are perhaps less appealing than the ones you do on your own.  Split legs tended to be colder and more difficult to get a good chunk of meat.  Still good!  

There are a myriad of dining options at this buffet.  The Kalbi Korean ribs were tasty.  The lamb chops were thin and covered in a delicious sauce.   I also enjoyed the all you can drink options.

Our waitress told us she has seen a number of people booted from the buffet due to fights, vomiting, passing out...I guess you get what you ask for when you let people drink infinitely!",0.0

"My husband and I went here one night just to try out a different Japanese\/Asian restaurant. 
We were standing by the hostess waiting to be seated for about 15min with no one else in line but us, although we could understand that she was on the phone with another customer who had a lot of questions. Regardless, I wish the manager, who was walking around just asking people how their dinner is, could have given us any of the many tables that were available that night. 
After we were seated, the server took about another 15-20min to get to us and said she thought our order was taken already. She was nice about it though but I still expected a little more than that.
My husband had their beef teriyaki and I had a couple of their sushis. 
His beef teriyaki was extremely disappointing as the beef seemed old and re-heated. It had an ok flavor to it but the quality of the meet was just terrible. 
The two rolls I ordered were just ok and had too much rice packed into it. There was nothing memorable about it at all. Paying more than $70 for a meal that I would have quickly tossed in the trash was painful. 
The one star I'm giving this restaurant is for our server who was kind enough to keep coming back to re-fill our hot tea. Other than that, I would never recommend anyone I know to this place to waste their money. There's a lot of other better Japanese restaurants in town.",0.0

Alas, I am telling you that you don't have to fear! As in all car dealships, they have to make a quota. Its simple and basic knowledge. Of course they are going to be going after what they can get you to pay without having to go too low. That's why you should do your research going into any car buying. Also, as a female, it is downright stupid for you to go to a car dealer alone unless you are willing to haggle like crazy and understand it all. Seriously. Sorry, ladies, but its true.

I took my roommate with me because he bought a new car here a year ago and has been thoroughly pleased. I was just starting to look at cars, but I knew I had to make a decision because mine was deteriorating fast! I test drove the two cars I had been eyeing online and I did walk away with one of them today. Before stopping here, I was at a Nissan dealership and the atmosphere was entirely different. I felt incredibly belittled, pressured, and as if HE was doing ME a favor by selling me a car. (I get it, that's his job, but I was still in the advantage of walking away.) 

Left that dealership, came over to this one. From the start, the environment was more relaxed to me. Atiq was my salesman, and he really did work for me. I felt like he actually cared about me as a person, and making me feel comfortable if I were to walk out the door with a car today. He listened to me and what I was just offered at the other dealership and countered with better. Then, in finances, Nick really helped me get an interest rate that I probably won't be able to beat! I was able to have human interactions with these two gentleman, which was appreciated because I am a high strung anxiety person when it comes to debt, payments, and any large purchases.

I'm only giving them a 4 because when I was signing paperwork, it wasn't really explained to me -- at all. My brain was about mush at this point, and I was just really ready to go eat.

Great beer list, and the servers are knowledgeable about the products.

Not sure what that's all about, maybe it's a themed night that I don't know about? Anyway was weird for a Tuesday night and we ended up leaving as I didn't feel like shouting at my friend over a casual beer.

Ending on a positive note: THE BURGERS ARE SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD. I have had burgers everywhere. I love ordering them, making them, eating them, they are the best. I've had two at Tallboys, the classic with cheddar cheese & the Blossington. Both were delicious, like juicy mouthwatering nicely cooked meat, great bun, everything good.

Came with 2 friends and we all shared the following: peach French toast, chiliquiles, sweet potatoe\/butternut enchiladas, crab dip and the crack pie. All were good. The French toast may be good to share as it got to be a little too much if you only had that. The bacon was really crispy which I loved. Crab dip was very good. Not a thick as we expected though. My friend thought it would make a good salad dressing. Tastes like the Trader Joes cilantro dressing. The crack pie was also yummy. You gotta eat that one there as they warm it up and it just melts.

"Avoid like the plague.  Dishonest in every respect. To preface my review, I will say that ultimately we received our furniture ""kind of"" as ordered.  However, it took us over a month of calling and working with this place to get our actual order delivered.  Huddle did everything to put the responsibility of their mistake on us!  Huddle delivered a MUCH smaller chair than we ordered.  Let's just say that I hardly fit in the chair we received, so I certainly would not have ordered it.  We tried out the chair in the showroom, and it was nice and roomy.  After telling Huddle they made a mistake, not only does Huddle say it's not their problem, they tell us to speak with the manufacturer.  Meanwhile, we had already gone to the website of the manufacturer and found our chair as ordered, and verified that the chair we received was about 6 inches smaller all around.  Here's the funny, and seriously DISHONEST and SHADY part; Huddle had obviously contacted the manufacturer, because the next day, they changed the measurements on their website, AND had the balls to try to act like the new measurements were the real ones and had been their the entire time!  FOLKS, we're talking about 6 inches.  Not a minimal difference.  They are obviously not technically savvy either, as changing a website is EASY to track.  SHADY.",0.0

The food was exquisite!!!! I had the pumpkin soup to start and it was delicious.  It had Carmelized onions and pumpkin morsals with some type of crispy on the outside crouton. It was also covered with delicious melted mozzarella.  For dinner I had the filet tenderloin with house potato chips and a mushroom rocker fella.  The steak was cooked to perfection and so tender. (Medium rare). I had a lovely mushroom sauce to go with it.  The chips were light and crunchy with a nice garlic salt flavor, and the mushroom rocket fella was superb.  For texture eaters, this place is Divine! The rocker fella consisted of a mushroom stuffed with bacon, crispy crumbs, and some type of filling. It was soft and crispy and crunchy... Yum! My friend shared with me her cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, which were so soft and fluffy (as opposed to the usual starchy rough mashed potatoes at restaurants).

"I ate here for breakfast with my girlfriend on 05-11-14. I pretty much was on the lookout for the cheapest\/closest breakfast buffet to our hotel, The Venetian. I planned on eating at the Wynn for our Lunch\/Dinner buffet experience and that's where I wanted to spend a lot of money at. I could see Treasure Island directly out of our hotel window so I decided to look up their buffet on Yelp and decided that would be perfect. We went at 0900 and we only had to wait in line about 15 minutes. It was Sunday so we had the Sunday Champagne Brunch which was a little more expensive than the normal weekday breakfast, but was very good. The quality of food wasn't out of this world like the Wynn's lunch, but I have a Ron Swanson love of breakfast food and you simply can't go wrong with a breakfast buffet. Pile mounds of bacon, ham, sausage, eggs, hash browns, pancakes, crepes on and repeat. The omelet station was really awesome and the lone woman working it was making 6 at a time and still made each perfectly to the guests specifications. She received a $2 tip from me and judging by the pile of money in her tip jar, others felt she was doing a good job too.

"I have been to this spa at least 5 times in the last year.  I live locally and bring everyone who comes to town to visit.  This weekend I brought my sister and her friend who were in town to run the marathon.  We all had massages in the afternoon.  My sister and her friend were very impressed that the spa was as nice as I had described.  It is a terrific place to relax and enjoy a quiet day away from the stresses of daily life.  I usually spend 1-2 hours before and after my massage working out, enjoying the steam room (with cold cloths for your face!), hot tub, ordering a bite to eat and a drink, and simply marveling in the view from the balcony. The soft water sound from the fountains and a cool breeze, I could nap there for hours and it would be worth the spa experience.

My only negative comment is that the front desk staff is less than friendly and often ""missing"" when you get there.  I think the first impression is not a good one.

First off, the music, some sort of mutant cross of twanging folk and tired country, really detracted from the experience. I had the ahi tuna salad which was both rather small and very salty. The combination of too much soy sauce on the tuna and too much of the sesame seed\/corse salt made way too much of a good thing. My beloved had the chopped veggie salad, which he enjoyed. But again, it was a little small. After tax and tip, we paid $35 for two smallish salads. Too bad, I was hoping to add a new restaurant to the rotation.",0.0
Ticket booth guy was friendly. Theater was clean. Movie was great. Bathroom was clean. The only thing I didn't like which I'm not sure if all theaters do this but they pre bagged their popcorn. It was cold when I got it. I mean nothing a little extra butter and salt can't fix but yea... Good times.,0.0
"I visited this store today and it has a *terrific* & very eclectic selection.  There are many interesting, clever, whimsical and sometimes colorful items, such as housewares and many other types of gift items.  Also; they have a very impressive selection of design and architecture (photo) books, plus lots of charming little books (humorous and others).  The card selection is really good, too.   Be prepared to spend some serious time looking at everything in this store.",0.0

"My boyfriend and I visit Margaritaville every time we visit Atlantic City, so we felt, for good luck, we had to continue the tradition in Las Vegas.  We just went to the bar for a quick appetizer to hold us over until dinner.  We each ordered a margarita and an order of nachos to share.  The waitress was prompt in taking our order and she made our drinks quickly.  The drinks were great as usual.

It took 45 minutes to receive our nachos- by that time it was stupid for us to even eat them since we were going for a huge dinner in just about an hour.  REPEATING THEME ABOUT LAS VEGAS- EXTREMELY SLOW SERVICE. We were disappointed by the speed of almost every restaurant we went to during our stay.  Other than that the nachos were great.  Piled high with all the works and yummy as usual.

We will be returning to Margaritaville in the future because its tradition and you know exactly what you are getting, but we will certainly leave more time if we visit again in Las Vegas.  Pick up the pace Vegas! I don't have time to waste- there is too much to do and see!",0.0
"We went here for a late lunch. As always we were greeted when we entered the restaurant.  We went to order and I wanted to try out the ""secret"" menu that I saw on the Web. I ordered a grilled cheese with a hamburger patty, bacon, grilled mushrooms and extra pickles. It took the cashier a little bit to figure it out, but she did.  Our orders came out just fine and my secret menu ""patty melt"" was SO GOOD!

Went in on a different day for an online order like I have in the past and was not greeted as usual nor acknowledged while I stood at the pick up side. I just looked at everyone no one asked if I needed assistance. I tried to say excuse me and they just kept their heads down. They weren't even busy.  I just wanted to tell them I was there to pick up my online order so that they could start on my fries. They do not start your fry order until you arrive so that they are fresh when you pick up your order. Since they didn't acknowledge me for at least 5 minutes of standing there, I sent my daughter to at least tell them we were trying to pick up our online order. Finally after her saying excuse me a few times they acknowledged her. We got our order a couple of minutes after that and left. Maybe they were having an off day?

"I was a die-hard Cibo fan when it came to pizza in the Phoenix area, but now it's a tough call! La Bocca was cute - not as intimate and hipstery as Cibo - more cozy and trendy. The wine list was amazing, and there was also a decent selection of beers on tap. If you're just planning on going out for drinks and appetizers with a small group, I recommend sitting in the ""lounge areas"" so you don't have to wait.
My bf and I went for dinner, and our server was great. She was very attentive and made excellent suggestions. We got the antipasti plate for a starter. Everything was tremendous, but the highlights were the prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese and the house pesto spread. Both fantastic and unique! For our main course, I ordered the smoked prosciutto Alfredo (which had orange zest that truly took it to the next level!) and my boyfriend ordered a build your own pizza. We shared our meals; the portions weren't HUGE but we had enough leftover for one lunch the next day. Finally, we couldn't resist getting the chocolate chip cookie for dessert. We shared, but it was small enough for one sugar-craving individual :)

"I hadn't been coming here long because I just moved to Arizona, but I've been with BOFA since I was 16 & my last experience at this location had me looking else where to bank. Not because of the tellers, they were great; but because there was a solid line & you could tell the 2 tellers were overwhelmed, while in the background there were at least 6 people just hanging out, which I later learned they were sucking up to some corporate big shot instead of assisting their employees in delivering customer service.

But, I returned today & walked in to a line to door. My natural response was ""my meter is going to expire"" & irritation ensued... However, not only did the 3 tellers work through the line in roughly 10 minutes (we're talking like 15 customers), but the same guy who helped me last time (I didn't catch his name tag but he wears nice shirts\/ ties & has glasses) greeted me as if I was the only person there & was very quick. I made sure to tell him that he & his team did very well working through the line.",0.0
"It was much better when it started.  Since then the quality and consistency goes down like waterfall.  Beef noodle soup was good, then tastes too sweet, then tastes like water with soy sauce.  Stinky tofu was not stinky enough at the beginning, then getting better, then became almost like fried tofu only.  Taiwanese oyster omelets is nothing like the one in Taiwan.  Stir-fried squid is said to be Taiwanese style but it is not even close.  Squid with napa cabbage is NOT Taiwanese style.  Soy bean paste noodle got the wrong type of noodle, and too watery.  The only good thing I would recommend is the seasonal fresh fruit smoothies.  They got some very surprising flavors, some you can't even get in Taiwan.",0.0
"4.5*.  Finally went by here after driving past the truck at Decatur and Meadows forever.  The restaurant itself is due to open on Wed 10\/08, but they are serving from the food truck in the parking lot.

For $9, the tortas are a great deal and are loaded with meat, cheese, vegetable, avocado, etc.  The food was all fresh made, and great.  Cheap and tasty and always busy.  They also have a large variety of meats, some your more conventional and some the more adventurous, at least for American palates.",0.0

I ended up transferring my lease to someone else, and they were trying to tell me they would not give me a written letter stating I successfully transferred the lease at no penalty, saying ""they don't do that."" Very unprofessional place and none of them know how to run a business. Not to mention, it's always so noisy here and the dumpsters are always overflowing with trash.

"We enjoyed our time at the Orange Sky on Thursday 10\/16\/14.  The staff starting with the young woman at the elevator to the person who cleared our plates were very friendly and professional.  The view was beautiful.  I noticed that some of the arm chairs were a little overly worn out.  I think they should get some love and attention.  Our server was Teresa and she was great.  I thought the salmon could have been grilled slightly longer but I am not a connoisseur nor a chef but the presentation was lovely.  My side was a little disappointing because there was a flavor in the red potato dish that overwhelmed.  I am picky but my friend whose birthday it was completely enjoyed the generous serving of perfectly cooked calamari, the shrimp dish and his side of gnocchi.  They brought him a delightful and beautifully presented chocolate mousse crunch for his birthday.  I want the dessert chef's writing ability in chocolate!

"Whenever I try a new tea place I order the default drink: BMT(boba milk tea). This is the simplest of drink to make yet difficult to get the flavor just right.

The boba texture was spot on - just the right amount of al dente, but the boba itself lacked flavor. If the boba had a honey flavor it would've added points to drink.

"When I first entered through the front doors of the Eaton Centre incarnation of Joey's, I wondered if I'd accidentally walked into Ford's models.

The atmosphere is ambient with energetic overtones, and the set up lends itself to keeping the crowds engaged and able to enjoy the whole room from the comfort of their table.

I ordered the Fettuccine Chicken Alfredo, and it was quite tasty. It came with a garlic bread appetizer which was also flavorful. I accompanied it with tonic water which balanced out the cream sauce and cleansed my palate for the garlic bread.

Just took my wife and Mother-in-law out for Mothers Day dinner at the Rio Buffet.  A disaster from beginning to end. My brother-in-law and family was also meeting us so the only way to sit together was to pay up front for all six meals before they arrived.  When the host was seating us she told me that I had not paid for their child even though our ticket said 5 plus 1.  We asked to sit near the crab legs before she sat us because of my mother-in-laws recent knee surgery and it turned out to be all the way across the buffet.  The bottom of the chair on the bench seat kept falling off so we asked to be moved and that took about 20 minutes of complaining and finally having to stop a manager to get moved.  The same host came back to relocate us but set up a table for only 5 and when I asked she said it was because we had only paid for 5 and not the child.  Again we had to get a manager and go to the register to prove we had paid for 6 people. After all this the manager then comped us the child due to all the trouble we were having.  So after about and hour and some minutes we got to sit down together to eat.  Not going to eat there again.  The food was below average anyway.,0.0

Breads - Free Refills (Lemon Focaccia w\/ Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom w\/ Pancetta + Pork Fat, Baguette w\/ Blue Cheese, Butter w\/ Volcanic Sea Salt) - Black truffle mushroom bread was amazing, baguette was decent, and lemon focaccia was average. Sea salt butter was one of the smoothest butter I've had.

Blue Crab Soup (blue crab, corn, red curry - $17 Total Rewards Member, $18 Regular Price) - Creamy texture with a bit of sweetness, sourness, and spiciness all in one bowl. Full of flavors and a pretty good soup. 

Kurobuta Pork Belly (cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus - $18 Total Rewards Member, $19 Regular Price) - Pretty good pork belly (some portion of meat was melt-in-your-mouth good), but all that tomato jam and onion pork just didn't enhance the overall flavor of pork belly.

Fingerling Potatoes (parmesan, truffle - $11 Total Rewards Member, $12 Regular Price): It has this very interesting roasted flavor - did not regret this order.

Roasted Beef Wellington (medium rare w\/ 45 minutes wait, glazed root vegetables, potato purée, red wine demi-glace - $99 for 2 Total Rewards Member, $101 for 2 Regular Price) - This should be the best order right? Well ... not at THAT price level. Well seasoned beef with flaky golden crust - so I could see the appeal, but I still prefer the traditional juicy cut steak. 

Sticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream - $13 Total Rewards Member, $14 Regular Price) - Ho, ho ho! Definitely best order of the day. Such an amazing dessert ... and brown butter ice cream was the BOMB! One of the hardest ice cream to cut with a spoon, so I just stabbed it with my fork and took one bite at a time. Simply the right sweetness and texture for pudding cake - man, so amazing. 

Over-hyped prices, pretty good appetizers and the Beef Wellington, and out-of-this-world sticky toffee pudding. Probably not worth $300 meal (for 2 or 3) because I am pretty sure you can get better food with that kind of money, but it is still not a bad choice for the special occasion (or your are simply a Gordon Ramsay's fan and say ""I've visited his restaurant ... at least once in my lifetime!"").",0.0
I got the pork sisig and i had them make it again because the first time it was bitter and i was thinking it was because it was burnt but the second dish was the same thing so i don't recommend the dish unless they change the recipe and maybe add more vinegar to it.,0.0

"We had very bad experience with Bolton Toyota(Organized by Dilwari Group). When we made deal with them I was told totally different then whatever happened. We were told  that we will get very less 10-15 mileage in brand new car and get our signed in 300 mileage without notifying us, They never answer my question right away, always being fishy.Taking so long to answer. Whenever we go to see them we always has to wait 2-3 hours still things are not getting cleared. We never been cleared for any paper work (Bill of sale). We were misguided for each and every factor.We request Bolton Toyota to stop cheating and misguiding people.

No one is helpful there its only sugar coated sales skills. when we've raised our voice  they are able to fix the problems and want us to buy the car from them and put pressure on us to buy the car because we have money deposited. We did not buy the car from Bolton Toyota because they broke our trust and its very hard to put trust again. After buying car we have to do service of our car as well and who knows if Bolton Toyota (Organized by Dilwari Group) will break the trust again.

"Bring my family to this Cold Stone store on 04\/10\/14 by far the worst experience I ever have!!!
 
We came here to actually complete our family day from the fun times we had at Craig Ranch Regional Park, when we get here I told the worker her name was ""Amanda"" that this is my daughter first ever visit to cold stone store and hoping Amanda can make my daughter first time experience would be a memorable one. Instead of being memorable it is the opposite Amanda was not suggesting a correct mix of ice cream in result the ice cream that she suggested to mix for my daughter taste so NASTY (my daughter didn't enjoy it at all) we end up throwing it away what a waste of $6.22 and on top of that Amanda also charge an extra topping without my consent when I'm about to pay and when I ask her why is my total over $7 she said I charge you an extra topping when she clearly said to me yeah I can get u an extra twix without a problem!!! Then when I question her about it she was upset at me! I'm a guest in this store I spend my money to complete our fun day not to get a shitty service from a known ice cream store! THIS IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE!!! Cold Stone store should be a kids friendly store not a store that make my daughter day gone bad!

"WE ARE OBSESSED WITH THIS PLACE!  

We have been coming here for years, way back to when the original owners of Phnom Penh (which now own Cuisine Du Cambodia) were here.  We stayed with this location during the ownership change and for a time continued to go to Phnom Penh, as that is what we were most familiar with.  We heard that the original owners were back and had re-opened the restaurant on Lorian rd. and W 130th so we came back!  WOW!!!  This place is so much better!  The portions are LITERALLY double the size of what you get at Phnom Penh and the prices are the same or less.  My husband and I usually order 2 or 3 dishes and eat them ""family style"" rather than having to choose only one dish.  You get so much food that we both eat until we are ready to explode and still have enough leftovers to bring home and eat one or two more times!   We bring a cooler filled with beer (as beer is the perfect compliment to the spicy cuisine).  We order everything HOT but you can order according to your spice preferences...although some of the dishes lend themselves to being enjoyed spicy and just simply do not translate well otherwise (in our opinion).  

Our favorites are:  Beef Hue Soup, Egg Rolls, Pork Pad Thai HOT, #39 HOT, and Asian Basil Combination Fried Rice HOT.  Woo hoo!!!!  But, you probably cannot go wrong with any of the dishes because everything is fresh and authentic and wonderful.  You must try it!!!  You may end up addicted to the food like we are!",0.0

"DO NOT GO HERE! Had my oil changed on 12\/2\/14. As I left the lot I pulled out onto University Ave and my car immediately died. I turned around and headed back to Jiffy Lube to see what the problem could be as my car was fine prior to the oil change. They took my car and ""said"" they ran a complete diagnostic test and said that my spark plugs needed to be changed and that my battery was bad. They immediately said ""we have a guy, would you like us to call him?"" I felt like I was being scammed, how can my car be completely fine prior to the oil change and then after the oil change I now need new spark plugs and possibly a new battery? I declined their offer to ""call their guy"" and decided to take the chance and drive home. 

Once home, i took my car to my local garage, which I should have done in the first place, and they informed me that Jiffy Lube failed to put the air filter on correctly after they changed my oil. Considering all Jiffy Lube does is change oil, I feel placing the air filter on correctly is something they do in their sleep. So, the so called diagnostic test that they ran was probably a load of BS and all they wanted to do was scam me into having ""their guy"" fix my unbroken car, which probably would have cost me an arm and leg.

"After living in morewood gardens for a year, I have tried most things on this menu. It's okay for college campus food I guess.

While the food can taste good, my problem is that everything here is really really greasy. This includes the perogies (which seems to have disappeared from the menu), the Reuben, the quesadillas, the cheesesteak, and the sweet potato fries. The Alfredo pasta isnt greasy per say but it does feel very oily and doesn't taste great. The salads also aren't very good - they sound exciting but they're just premade and put in  containers that you can pick up  at the register and premade salads are never good. One bonus is free coffee after 8 pm during finals though!

  We ordered our dishes, but to our surprise he brought us bruchetta to try. Not only was it kind, but the tomato bruchetta was clearly made fresh & not packaged. Our dishes came (we had the seafood pasta ) But although we asked for rosee sauce instead of regular, and linguini noodles, he gave us the exact one on the menu, when previously stating that he could accommodate our changes (which is why a star was lost). Other than that, the flavour was amazing! and the portion was large, with lots of seafood in my dish.

I sat myself and watched 15 employees scurry around for 10 minutes before I got up and went to the bar and waited another five minutes for someone to serve me.

I had shopped at their store several times and found several items I had been missing,  from my  years of living in California. I found the prices good and the owners cordial. Therefore, I was not surprised to find the tacos were as noted in most reviews ... simply wonderful. I chose one with pork and the other with steak and onion ... toppings were varied and delicious. My only regret is that I only bought two. The next time I will double my order. I sipped cold coconut juice from the store as the perfect accompaniment.

3 reasons: The owners, the space and the products.  

I love indie coffee shops and gelato parlors in general, and the owner is a great example of why.  I got to know him one morning and heard about how he wanted to create a small local shop that serves a smaller number of people well vs a characterless shop that serves a high number of people in a mediocre way.  He's very particular, everything is considered and when you're a patron in his shop, it's his experience you're getting (and it's a great experience).  He put time, money, care and effort where it matters, from the gelato equipment to the coffee machines, the pastry selection, the decor, etc.  Ask him about any of them.  There's a story, there's reason and there's thought behind everything.  Also ask him about the music.  There's a story behind that too.

"This would be 4.5 stars.

My second trip to Las Vegas with my wife.  First trip was back in February 2004 at The Bellagio in a standard room.  That was a 5 star experience due mostly to the staff, quality of the property and amenities.  That was 10 years ago but it is all I have to compare to this trip, which I will do.

We stayed at a Parlor Suite on the 38th floor with a strip view.  Hands down, this was the finest room I've ever stayed in a hotel or resort.  Including places such as The Ritz Carlton in Battery Park, The Plaza in NYC, The Beverly Hills Hotel and the fore mentioned Bellagio.  The Wynn property is by far, the most beautiful I've ever seen.  All top notch appointments and the quality and detail of virtually everything Wynn, is second to none!

We dined at:  Zoozacrackers Deli, The Buffet (lunch and dinner) and SW Steakhouse.  The deli was good and on the high side of reasonable in price but after all, it's The Wynn we're talking about here so quality ambience comes at a premium.  

The Buffet for lunch was very good and worth the money while the quality of the food was decent considering it was a buffet.  Dinner however, was disappointing.  Fairly poor service, inattentive wait staff and some of the offerings weren't all that hot.  Avoid the crab legs but the carved prime rib was pretty tasty and savory.

SW Steakhouse was altogether different.  Pricey but ""exceptional"".  Attentive, professional and courteous staff that appreciated our desire to keep a handle on the budget for the meal yet still treated us as well as the high rollers all around us.  I cannot say enough good things about this group of people whom served us quite possibly the finest Rib Eye ever.  The aged steak was brazed to perfection and was so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife.  My tastebuds were literally in fantasyland!  The bill came to $240 for two, including wine, a side dish, dessert and tip.  Money well spent.

Where The Wynn falls short is on two issues.

First, for staying in a expensive suite, I did not feel ""pampered"".  Certainly not as we did at The Bellagio ten years ago.  While things may have changed everywhere in regards to staff issues, our service here overall was ""good"" but not ""great"".  

The second issue which is on the same concept, was the valet.  We arrived in the afternoon in a rental car which was a Chevy Impala.  The valet did not attend to us the way I would expect as the valet for the Tower Suites, is located separate from the general entrance.  By the 6th night, I would think that the attendants would recognize a suite guest and act accordingly.  Not that such service should differ for anyone but a paying guest in a top category room, should be treated much better than we were.  My wife had to open her own door and twice, I had to approach the staff for service.  We got better service at the casino valet at the MGM which is unacceptable considering the cost of our stay.  

This may sound trivial and maybe it is.  However, premium hotels should have premium standards.  When ""common"" people like myself, choose to splurge a bit for a quality experience, I should have an expectation that this experience, should be just as good as it is for high rollers.

I still highly recommend The Wynn and in most regards, it is a premier resort.

NOTE:  we don't gamble, so I can't evaluate the very plush casino.  Other than to say that the cigarette smoke is a bit annoying but it isn't nearly as bad as it is in some lower caliber casinos.  It looks very nice though.",0.0
"Great food and good service. However if you want to dine in especially with family, you better make reservations for a table at the back of the restaurant. The restaurant becomes extremely busy especially during dinner time and since the tables are so close together with very minimal space, it gets very annoying having servers serve food to other tables bumping into your chair and\/or serving food over your head. Although its a good restaurant, it needs to consider its' capacity and seating plan.",0.0

I had a forgettable manicotti which is regrettable since it was one of my fonder Italian restaurant dishes when I was a wee & not so wee lad. The memories come flooding back. The old school Italian restaurant with red tablecloths, dim lighting & Frank Sinatra playing. The oversized plates piping hot with good quality ricotta stuffed into homemade shells. Dad yelling at the waitress because the coupon was expired, but actually upset that his marriage had fallen apart. Good times.

Most of the other dishes failed to impress, at least visually. There just felt to be a laziness about the food. The sauce seemed watery as did the cheese. I'm aware that  there will always be water when pasta is present, but it was too wet. Overall, a bland experience and not quite enough food. I know know.

I would have to say this drink rivals Urth Cafe's Green Tea Boba blended drink, and may even surpass it.",0.0

"Cool little trendy dig.  Hipster family friendly and active interactive.  Nice hub for a bit of First Friday-like art or local business support.  There are a few restaurants including Mexican, bar food and even a Vegan chef there.  You can find boutique clothing like the Bettie Page lingerie and a separate Bettie Page shoe shop.  You can get a haircut at the Barber shop too.  In the middle is an enclosed play area that is attended by a clerk who makes sure that your kids can't just wander off.  It has a pretty tall multilevel fun house including a really long winding slide.  You can watch popular family movies from a giant projector on Thursday evenings.  There is a stage for what I think may be live acts.  When the sun is waning they make a semi impromtu drum circle and encourage the kids to play along while a giant Mantis emits flames.  Pretty cool.  The kick to it all is that it shows examples of green living and how even businesses can think outside of the box reuse abundant resources and still be sheik.

"I would say maybe 2.5 and that might be pretty generous. I'm not exactly sure why this place such high reviews? It's a local bar, and you can tell it's mostly locals that go here. So here's the breakdown...

I had some boneless wings and a side salad. The wings were probably the smallest ones I have ever seen, but they weren't awful. They had good flavor, but for being spicy garlic I didn't taste much spice or garlic. The side salad was normal for bar I guess, not terrible but it was kids lettuce mostly. My husband had what they call oakies which are pretty much just sliders. They were $.60 a piece. So even if they were terrible, which they weren't, you can't beat that price. They were over cooked a little but still, not bad. The order of fries he ordered were probably frozen first, but he got a good amount of them. My mother in law got a blt wrap with ham on it. She didn't say it was bad, but she did say she could make it at home. 

The service wasn't bad, even tho it seemed like there was only one guy that was running all the tables and the bar. When there's only about 3 tables and a half a dozen people at the bar I guess it's not that hard. So you see, going in I didn't expect much and I wasn't disappointed but I wasn't impressed. It is also somewhere I wouldn't go back to if I had the choice.",0.0
"I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant after reading a lot of the reviews.  The restaurant is in a cozy house.  The service was fantastic and the food came out quickly.  I had the gnocchi gorgonzola.  I don't think they make the gnocchi in house, but it tasted good.  I was surprised how much flavor was in the simple side of pasta that came with my wife's eggplant parm that she loved.  Now, is this the best Italian food I have every had, no.  Is this a place I would recommend, yes.",0.0

"My boyfriend and I ate here for the first time today, just went in on a whim cause we were starving. We ordered the fried chilli prawns, sweet and sour pork, and fried rice noodles and beef in soy sauce. The prawns were delicious, the serving size was huge! I've never gotten so many prawns for $8 in my life. The sweet and sour pork was one of the best I've ever had, the pork was cooked perfectly and the sauce was not overly sweet. The noodles and beef were okay, the beef was cooked perfectly, but there just wasn't much flavour overall. 

The service was very slow but we figured for the price and the tasty food it was worth the wait. Our bill came out to $22.90 for the 3 dishes which is insane. The waitress told is it was cash only, so my bf ran to the bank to quickly draw some cash, and we happily put down a $5 tip because we were so pleased and stuffed from the food. 

This is where things went downhill. We waited literally 20 minutes with our cash on the table as the waitress repeatedly walked past our table without attending to us (I was going to ask for change because I left $30, and I wanted $5 back). She  stood next to us and collected dishes in a bin for a while, deliberately with her back to us. We eventually got fed up with being ignored so I took back my $10 and we left $23 exactly and started walking.

As we got to the door we were stopped by our waitress, she showed us our bill, and she asked us 'where is your tip?'. I couldn't believe what I just heard. I explained to her that we had been waiting for 20 minutes with our tip on the table as she walked passed us multiple times and ignored us, and this is why we decided to not tip. She looked at us in confusion and asked us again to tip her, at which point we just said we're sorry but you should really attend to your customers more and we left.

"This location is not capable of basic copy center functions. I had a simple copy job of 15 pages and I asked if they cut cut the pages in half, as the handout was two to a page. The kid told me it was $0.25 per cut and that it would cost $0.25 PER PAGE. I was like, ""Don't you have an industrial paper cutter?"" and the kid showed me a scrapbooking paper cutter and said that's what they used. My husband could SEE the industrial paper cutter behind the kid and pointed that out. The kid was like, ""oh, um, I could try but if I mess up you'll have to pay for more copies."" What? Then the kid told me he could probably cut four pages at a time on the scrapbook paper cutter.

"Oh, please. Might be a good place for drinks, but it was a bust for brunch. When you occupy an historic building you might think you go for a look that's either charming or edgy, and Bar Marco is neither. Tables are small, chairs not all that comfortable, the servers lean toward pretense and away from professionalism -- flatware but no napkins? Who does that? My friend asked for decaf and got a ""no"" dripping with sarcasm, as if to say, ""we don't treat our beans that way."" On to the food: the Bloody Mary was good, if skimpy. A dish billed as fried chicken with dandelion greens, topped with a fried egg -- yeah, screw heart disease -- consisted of two overly crusted and overly fried thighs completely concealing a half-dozen threads of wilted-to-death greens. When you have guest chefs, you can't hang crap food on the kitchen because they can simply blame the guest. I know this approach is trendy but it's a bad idea because the secret of every solid restaurant is consistency, Cute idea, though, cute location, cute clientele, but if I want to eat cute, I'll trim my Chia Pet and skip Bar Marco.",0.0
"A mixed gathering of ""January"" Birthdays.  About 16 of us were quickly seated. Drinks were a little slow...but there were a bunch of us all at once.  Orders taken.  Here's the issue:  I ordered a Kobe Steak Burrito with NO Pico De Gallo and then reiterated....NO onion, NO tomato, NO Pico.  Waiter asked how I would like it cooked. "" Well Done please"" (being I actually had E Coli about 12 years ago and was hospitalized). 

Food comes in a timely manner.  I cut my burrito in half and take a bite. Literally ""raw"".  Im not a BBQ master...so I asked around.  We decided that is was extremely Rare and the opposite of Well Done.

Waiter came and he was upset with the kitchen as he should be. Roughly 5 minutes go by and a lady with dark longer curly hair (I assume a manger) brings another burrito.  Cut it open to investigate....meat is Well Done.... but it is full of Pico and Tomato and Onion.

Same guy waiter takes it back and we asked to not have the cooks spit in are third shot. Ha ha...though we were serious.

"About two weeks ago I went to the Boulder Hwy store to get replacement pump housing for my Spa. The staff seemed very knowledgeable and from the pictures I provided they pulled the part from the shelf and I was on my way. As it turned out the part was not quite right (size) so I went back down with the damaged housing in hand to ensure I would get the correct part. I was told the part was a ""special order"" in stock in Pomona Ca. (special order-in stock??) After 10 days the part arrived and I picked it up yesterday only to find it was also the wrong part.  I called and spoke to a ""Manager"" and attempted to understand how I could get the wrong part after taking the serial # & part # right off the damaged part. I was amazed as to the lack of understanding and responsibility I heard over the phone. I deal with customer service every day in my job and I can't believe how poorly I was treated over the phone.
Today, and I mean, just now....I spoke to the Manager @ the Windmill store and he is having the correct part shipped overnight so my weekend plans will all go well.

"I should say up front that I HATE car dealerships.  However, Midway Nissan was great from the front end through the back end of the process.  Aside from some mixed signals between the front office and the finance department (regarding how many years of free oil changes and tire rotations you get from the dealership - 2 years) the process was smooth sailing.  One improvement - ALL DEALERS ARE SLOW AS MOLASSES to move you from sale to finance.  Even though I think we were out of there in 8 hours (arrived at 1:30 and departed by 9:30 PM), there has to be a better way to speed up that process between ""yes"" and signing.

"So I had just moved to Vegas and was looking for a new gym but I get shy when working out so it's hard to find a place that works for me. I was on Groupon one day as I always am and saw an amazing deal for Revolution and thought ""why not?"" and thank God I did! 

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by one of the owners, Deidre, and quickly found out that this isn't just a gym, it's a community. They care about your health and want you to succeed. They have parties often as a thank you to the members, they do a first Monday where they bring in a DJ and you can bring a friend to class for free. When you walk in you are greeted immediately and it is always a friendly face. Ray, the other owner, makes sure to connect with everyone and at least say hello. It's hard to stay under the radar there which is exactly what I need. Sometimes I travel for work and they even notice when you're not able to attend classes. 

There is something for everyone and the BEST part of Revolution is that all the work outs are intense and a solid sweat but you go at your pace. I might be slower at everyone else at certain exercises but I'm doing my personal best which is the whole goal. 

Debbi, Candace, Deidre, Ray, Stetson and all the trainers are so amazing. I simply cannot say enough. I'm so happy I found this place. I now enjoy going to the gym and even call it my happy place. That's not like me at all!

"X-Tapa Joe's is yet another mexican restaurant in Scottsdale that's alright, but nothing all that special.  It'll satisfy your taste buds, but will not blow them away.  It's also a little overpriced.  Fortunately, there is a $30 for $15 gift certificate on Local Dines (http:\/\/www.localdines.com\/phoenix?ref=19485).  That definitely makes the place worth a try.

I had the spinach enchiladas. Pretty standard.  My wife had the chicken fajitas.  Again, pretty standard, but the tortillas were ridiculously big, more burrito sized than taco.  I will give X-Tapa Joe's credit for having the chips and salsa brought to the table just seconds after being seated.  I will not complain about that!

X-Tapa Joe's calls itself an upscale mexican restaurant.  There's a hilarious hypocrisy to this description.  There are handwritten paper signs all over the restaurant and handwritten changes to the menu.  Pretty cheap and low scale.

Store is small and exterior decor and signage is a bit tacky, IMO, but at least its distinctive? Inside you'll find everything you can possibly purchase that is related to Zombies, hence the name.

We are restaurant\/bar manager owners in Cleveland and this experience was very unfortunate.  We were really looking forward to our visit to Creekside because of the ambiance and great patio setting.  We were greeted by the hostesses and they both seemed concerned about which server would take our table, however it seemed very empty.  We were greeted quickly by our server and asked what we would like to drink.  There is an extensive drink list, so we needed a minute to look over the menu.  Our waitress returned and took our drink order and once she returned, about 10 minutes later to deliver drinks, we place our order for the appetizer and entrees.  The appetizer, flat bread was great and came out quick.  About 30 minutes from our food order, we both has empty drinks, empty plates and empty waters and had not seen our server since the appetizer was delivered.  Many others servers walked by on multiple occasions and none of them bothered to ask anything or take and pates off of our table.  

We wanted to order a bottle of sparkling, so unfortunately I had to go inside and find our server to place this order.  Once she brought the bottle out, already opened because she was nervous to open it(little tip: bring another serve or bartender to the table and have them open it for us) we had still not received our food.  I mentioned to her that it had been quite long for a medium burger and salmon, and she completely ignored my comment.  The food finally came and other than my husbands burger cooked well done rather than medium(food sat in the service window for a long time) we can't complain. 

We have heard that this place is amazing and really wanted to try it out, unfortunately for us, our service was sub par and hopefully a fluke.  We of course will giver the place and our server another try because we know of all people what it is like to have an off night.  I would reference the server, but she did not even tell us her name.",0.0

Plenty of seating with a good view of their brew set up. 
I had the amber which was very good. For once a micro brew that isn't too hoppy. I also had their Dam Hot burger which was awesome. Not too huge that you make a mess of yourself.

"This was my first experience with Sixt and I was very impressed.  I had reserved a standard SUV for 11 days.  The price quoted was less than what the major rental companies would charge - with discounts - for what they called a standard sized car but what I would call an intermediate.  

When I arrived at the airport counter I was greeted with a pleasant smile from the agent.  He said I have some good news and some bad news for you.  He said the bad news was the SUV I was expecting was not available but the good news was that he was upgrading me.  He told me I was in for a surprise.  When I asked for a map he said it would not be necessary since the car had a navigation system.  He then handed me the keys and I saw it was for a Mercedes Benz SUV!  I went down to pick up the car and since I had never driven such a car it took some time to get familiar with its instruments.   An agent came over without being asked and showed me all that I needed to know.  I was off and the time spent renting a car was far less than what I was accustomed.   The car was immaculate and in good running order.

The return was effortless and a receipt was e-mailed to me by the time I got to the gate. The individual handling the return took our suitcases out of the back and inspected the interior to be sure we left nothing behind.

And I can honestly say that I like it. Here at the airport, it has a simple menu. (I don't know about the other Red Mango's) but here.. It's simple. 

It is sorta expensive because they juice and make smoothies & yogurt. And it's all fresh.

"This bad rating isn't reflective of the store as a whole, but in the framing department. I went in to get a series of prints framed. I knew what I wanted and assumed it would be straight forward to order. The lady whom I spoke with was far less than helpful. 

She said I NEEDED a matte. When I politely refused her suggestion of a 4"" matte, she said, ""Well I guess I could do a 1.5"" matte"" (Implying I was inconveniencing her to do something out of her comfort zone). Next she suggested frames that I was not interested in. Again, I declined saying I wanted something simple.  Her reply back was ""I'm told I have an eye for this thing.""  Be that as it may, you clearly don't have mindful customer service.

There was no one that greated us at the door, we just waited around and when no one came we just sat down where there were seats. 

I got a hot chocolate and waffles with fresh fruit. It was good, the waffle tasted like it was frozen and than warmed up or maybe a box-batter. You seriously can't go wrong with whipped cream and strawberries. Their hot chocolate was more luke-warm than hot. I love my beverages steaming opposed to room temperature. It took another 20min for the person to come back to our table to see how we were so I couldn't ask for it to be warmed up more. If it was hot, I'm sure it would be delicious.

"This place is good. I wouldn't say it's the best burger place ever like some reviewers have said, but it was good.

We ordered the fried pickles which were decent. The insides were lava hot, even after a while of letting them sit to cool. I am pretty sure these are frozen, though. My grandma owns a restaurant and tried out fried pickle spears for the menu and I tried those. Pretty sure these were the exact same ones. 

My husband is a huge burger fan. I don't know if he loves anything more.
He got the golden standard burger that apparently has won a bunch of awards or something (according to our waiter).
When I asked him how he likes it, he just shrugged. I was shocked. He said it was alright, but if we ever ate there again, he would try something else. 

I had the blackened salmon po-boy. It was really good but super awkward to eat because it's a long piece of salmon sitting on a hamburger bun. I had to piece off some of the salmon and eat that separate before diving into the sandwich. Overall, a good choice. The slaw on it was really good. I got sweet potato fries and they tasted just like every other sweet potato fry. Good, but nothing crazy amazing.

We didn't get a shake because we were outrageously full, which is a disappointment on our part hah.

"Clearly to go-to spot for Case Western academic expense accounts, L'Albatros is deceptively wee from the outside and slightly disorienting on the cozy interior, as the entry is next to the open kitchen and the main dining room is through a room to another room.  Nevermind, this thoroughly French bistro is a welcome retreat from the snowy Cleveland winter.  True French bistros are hard to come by in the Midwest and if you are like us, you will appreciate the kitchen's inventive and especially fresh greens.  Portions are large, especially the hearty cassoulet which can easily serve two.  Although we didn't order it, the table behind us was swooning over the Assiette de Fromages.",0.0

Ordered half a dozen oysters for $16. Got 3 differ by kinds (2 of each). All were very tasty. The horseradish was super pungent. Awesome! Weird thing is that half a dozen oysters was $16, while a full dozen would have been $34...is it just me or does the math not add up?

Even though it was 94 degrees outside, the waiter told me the clam chowder pot pie is just too good to pass up so I had to get it. And I'm so glad I did! The pie crust was the perfect amount of flakiness. The chowder was not as thick as most I've had but still very tasty. So many clams! And the bits of bacon just really added to the flavor. 

The prices were decent. A little bit pricy but very reasonable for a seafood restaurant. I was hesitant at first since the restaurant was so empty but very glad I took a chance on it. 

Only weird thing was while I was sitting in the patio area a homeless(?) man came by trying to sell me a CD of his rapping. Totally random and unexpected. Maybe I was just surprised since this seemed like such an uppity area.  A little off putting at first but that really has nothing to do with the restaurant itself.",0.0

The marble rye bread was so soft and tasty it does not have any rye seeds. I miss that I like the seeds on mine. The cornbeef had a nice flavor to it. Over all the sandwich was pretty good and all the flavors blended well. The things that I would fix to make this sandwich awesome would be: Spread the meat out over the bread so that would cause for more meat, add more thousand island dressing and saurkroute. And bam!

"I have been home from our vacation in Vegas a week. I waited to write this review because I wanted to give this restraurant a chance to make it right by at least receiving a phone call back from the owner or the manager that we dealt with during our visit at the Windmill location. I thought once he had a chance to think about his actions he would have had a change of heart because never in my life have I ever been treated so poorly and I am truly baffled how he handled my situation.
  We visited the location around 2:30 on a Thursday. I wasnt feeling well when we got there so I didnt order anything. My husband saw Bachi Burger on the Food Network and had been dying to try it. When he ordered his burger he inquired to the waitress about one of the ingredients, she said those are ""japanese mushrooms"", my husband says ""please no mushrooms"" ,and I said ""he hates mushrooms! The burger comes out and it is smothered in mushrooms,he takes one bite ,not knowing, and spits it out. We tell the waitress this has mushrooms and she apologizes. I, at that point told my husband I wasnt feeling well at all and that I dont think I can wait for them to remake it and that we needed to go. We informed the waitress of this. We also apologized to her for not being able to wait on another one to be made. She quietly walks away from the table and we get up and leave. Once we get outside the manager approaches us and says ""you know its against the law to walk out on a tab"". We then tell him that we had informed the waitress that I wasnt feeling well and that the burger had mushrooms on it. He then said ""well she said you didnt order without mushrooms!!!"" Really, he said that!! I said she was lying and lets talk with her,but he refused, all he kept saying is this is really awkard,this is really awkard!!! What does that mean? There was nothing awkard about it.What he should have said was ""hey guys is there anything i can do for you guys to fix this situation?? Funny thing is,is that when we left I wasnt even mad at all and had planned on coming back the next day!!!!! I own a restraurant and undertstand employees make mistakes and had i felt better we would of had it remade,no biggie!! So anyway, he storms back inside and so do I because I wanted his name. The employee at the front refused to give it to me and when  he walked back up I asked him and he refused, as well. At this point he says ""I am calling the police"" I go out to my car and he is pacing outside on the phone,at that point we ask him several times ,do we need to stay for the police.He wouldnt answer. After about five times asking him he says""yes stay here and wait in your car""!! So we did. Police get there and get my side of story and go in and ask him what he wants and he replies""I just want them to leave""!! Really! Thats what we were trying to do!! Ridiculous! When we got home we called and told a manager at another location what had happened ,even though he was understanding and said it should have never happened and handled wrong. when i asked for a phone call from the owner, I was refused and was also refused the owners name!!!What! I was astounded! Its not that hard to find out! I am a franchisee of a restraurant and I could never imagine my employees or myself refusing to give my name out. I am proud of the business that I run and want everyone to know who is behind it.  I think it is something yall should think about.

I love Pure+Simple on King.  I've been going there a few times a year for the past 4 years for their monthly special facials.  This week I was there for their Pumpkin facial.  I was worried that it might be sickly sweet, but it was the pumpkin pulp I smelled which for me was unique and favourably organic.  I adore their facials with the facial massages (my sinuses ALWAYS drain...), the organic cleansers, lotions and masks.  The steam is just the right temperature and the extractions are done perfectly.  Let's not forget the shoulders\/neck, arms, legs and scalp massage that's included in the facial as well that tends to make the whole experience last just over an hour.  I almost fall asleep every time.  I enjoy that I'm not bothered by chit chat during the facial and that any product talk is done pre or post facial.

I've also bought their products to use at home and I've never been disappointed.  As I've told all my friends, this is a PERFECT day spa experience with high quality products and technicians and a very likeable approach to beauty and wellness.",0.0

You can taste all the amazing infused oil flavors, like rosemary, lemon, basil, even an Indian Masala that is killer! Chris added the Masala oil to Hummus and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!

"Myself and two friends went to Tres Potrillos Friday 10\/17\/14 for lunch. We chose this restaurant after finding a $1. taco special ad in the Medina town Money Saver magazine.  The ad reads, ""Celebrate National Taco Day All Month with $1. Crunchy Tacos! During the Month of October."" There is NO indication of specific days and the ad clearly indicates is ""ALL MONTH"". We were told that the special was only on Thursday and the manager would not honor the ad for us. We decided to order other food since we were already there which I am sure others are doing. I consider it a ""bait and switch"" false advertising to get customers in the door.  Aside of this issue, the service was then less than desirable as they switched servers on us twice then sent the manager to deliver our bill. The restaurant was not busy yet service was slow and we were only checked on once after receiving our food.",0.0
"After living in Pittsburgh for four years, my husband and I finally visited The Andy Warhol Museum for the first time several weeks ago. I had enjoyed seeing his art in various museums from MoMA in NYC to the Hunter Museum of American Art in Chattanooga, so I felt that my expectations were high. 

I'm sad to say that I wasn't blown away by the collection. Only a few rooms of the museum held what I consider to be his iconic works of art. However, the museum did do a nice job of giving us a timeline of his life, from his early years in Pittsburgh and in art school to his later years rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous in New York. 

My favorite part of this museum experience - and the motivating factor to finally come visit after living here for four years - was the Halston and Warhol: Silver and Suede exhibition. Seeing Halston's iconic fashion designs - from the ultrasuede shirtdress and Jackie O's pillbox hat - paired up with Warhol's artwork was absolutely breathtaking. 

My recommendation is to keep an eye on the exhibitions and come visit when you find one that you absolutely can't miss.",0.0
"Probably my favorite brunch spot in Madison. You can always expect to wait at least 15 minutes at Marigold, because they serve food in style similar to Panera (wait in line to order & pay, wait at table for food), and the line always reaches to the door. It's worth the wait.

I usually opt for the breakfast sandwich option, which is different depending on when you go, since Marigold has a rotating menu. The sandwiches are always amazing, though the accompanying potatoes are just okay. It's usually enough food for me to take something home. I've also tried the scramblers a few times and have never been disappointed.

When we got our burgers, we were amused by the ""T"" imprinted on the top bun.The one thing that surprised me was how tasty the bun was. It had a sweetness to it that made the burger unique in taste.

The food is to die for, I've tried their ribs, and the pulled pork sandwich, both were superb! The cornbread is amazing, I have to remind myself to save room for the actual meal. Also, at the end of the meal, they bring you freshly-made, warm cinnamon-sugar donut holes to enjoy. It's a bit far out location-wise, especially if you are in the Tempe\/Mesa area, but for the best BBQ in Arizona, it's worth the drive!",0.0

"Let me start by saying that the people at Baierl are great. Very nice & personable and I really enjoy dealing with them, which makes this review even more upsetting for me

I had my car in a couple of weeks ago because it was randomly not starting. I was leaving for vacation, driving to Florida with 2 children, so I stressed the importance of needing my car fixed. I advised I believed I needed a new battery. I was told I did not need a new battery, they had charged my battery completed and I would no longer have this issue, at a cost of around $50. While on vacation, my car did the same thing 3 times- once in rural West Virginia. It was extremely scary. I called the service department and they told me to bring it back in.  I dropped my car off first thing Friday morning. By Friday evening I had not heard anything so I called - I was told my car needed a test overnight, and I could get it the next day, and there was no loaners available. I called numerous times on Saturday to no answer. I was stranded at home with my child and no transportation. I was finally able to get a ride up Saturday afternoon only to find out nothing had been done to my car. There was nobody in in the service department- the service department next door at Chevy, and one of the gentlemen in sales (who were all terrific btw and very helpful) were able to find my car, and advised me that nothing had been. They were thankfully able to find me a car to drive in the interim. I did not hear anything from Cadillac service until Tuesday when they advised that I needed a new battery. So not only did I pay to have my battery charged just a couple weeks before, but now I was charged $160 for a new battery. On top of being without my vehicle for 4 1\/2 days.  I am very not pleased. On top of everything, I had mentioned needing an oil change, and when I picked up my car, it had not been done, so rather than have to wait who knows how long to get it done, I had to go elsewhere to get my oil change. I have been coming to Baierl Cadillac since I bought my first Cadillac, and the people are terrific there, but the service and time for the last 2 visits really disappointed me to the point that I do not know if I will return.",0.0

Women were lined up to go into the shower area, the smaller pools were overcrowded and unable to accommodate the flow of guests and the sauna was too crowded to even enter.  The worst was the massage which was very stressful because of the peripheral noise of chatter and people walking around the treatment area.

The stage itself needs a lot of work. Although, I think they are maintain the originality of the place. The acoustic is not the greatest, but that's not a deal breaker. But from the look of it, this venue is great for a date and just a casual hangout.

My wife's roast beef special was tasty although it could have used a stronger horseradish sauce.  My meatball mozzarella sandwich was large and moist with plenty of cheese.  The only complaint was that our calamari appetizer was a bit salty.  Service was friendly and prompt and the cost was very reasonable.

We caught the Hertz shuttle immediately upon exiting the terminal and it took no more than 5 minutes to get to the rental car facility.

Upon returning the car, we were immediately met by a scanner dude and this other kid who was just finishing grad school who I guess was doing some sort of internship at this location.

"This place is the real deal.  Food here is more authentic Hawaiian than food in Hawaii.  I LOVE this place and we go every time we visit the Premium Outlets.  The spam musubi, saimen, and the local plate are my favorites.  The sweet and sour spare ribs are good too.  On the local plate you get beef, spam musbi, and teriyaki chicken and rice and mac salad. Wish I could substitute the sweet and sour spare ribs for the beef.  The beef is just meh.  The teri chicken is PHENOMENAL.  The skin is crispy and the sauce so perfect.   Not too sweet or salty - just perfection!!!  OMG, I'm craving a local plate now that I'm writing this review.  I could eat at this place 2x a week - not that it's good for you.  The restroom outside of this restaurant seems very well kept and clean compared to other casinos.  Only downside is that this place can get crowded.  Sometimes you have to share a table with someone.  The other downside is that it's in a dive of a casino in downtown that is filled with cigarette smoke.

"This place has great service but unfortunately the food misses the mark.  They are going for high end cuisine with a high end price, but the flavours really did not add up.  The ingredients were fresh and hyper local, often coming straight from their roof, which I thought was lovely.  However, something about the flavours in my dishes did not really seem like they went together very well.  It seemed more like ""lets mix really random stuff and call it high end"".
Some of the food we ate:
1.  I had the silken tofu and the flavours on that were very odd, some bites were bland and other very salty.
2.  Black noodles with radish cake.  That was actually really good.
3.  Vegetarian carpaccio.  This was ok.
4.  Cornish hen.  This was pretty good, but also on the salty side.
5.  The lobster.  This was really good and my favourite of the evening.
6.  The chocolate caramel dessert.  Now this sounded amazing, but the cake was a bit dry.  The icecream was mostly melted by the time it go to me and the mousse was not sweet.  
7.  Rhubarb dessert.  This was ok but very very tart.

I couldn't find one so I grabbed an employee passing by and told him. Your restroom has NO toilet seat covers, NO paper to wipe my ass, NO soap, NO paper towels and it's very dirty. 
Employee said ""I know man, that's why when I have to go, I use the one in Office Depot or I wait till I go home""

I'm not sure what one of the other reviewers was talking about when comparing the mac and cheese to Kraft's because it was definitely homemade. Be forewarned, though that the mac & cheese has got a spicy kick that was a little too spicy for my kids.

Their selection is absurd! I almost had to laugh how much cheese can occupy one place.  But the nice thing is that it is not only cheese.  They have cured bacon.  Cheese and bacon in one place.  Oh, and Door County wines.  Yeah.  This is right off the freeway and conveniently located when I am on my way from work which is dangerous.

We were led to our table and given the menus which were on old record sleeve (cool!) There were tons of beers and drinks to choose from, and I got the electric blueberry lemonade while my friends tried different pumpkin spiced beers- All were delicious.  

For my meal, I ordered the buffalo chicken grilled cheese sandwich and oh my goodness was it tasty! The blue cheese crumbles paired perfectly with the buffalo sauce, and the whole sandwich reminded me of buffalo chicken dip.  The fries are outstanding (not too much salt and not at all soggy).

"Ice cold mugs, tiny pitchers, beer.  What a great way to start after a long hike on a chilly Sunday afternoon.  The warm chips and tasty salsa were immediately brought to the table.  Next came our waiter, a newbie to Arizona from Arkansas, with a cute southern drawl, easy demeanor and not bad on the eyes, either.  But most importantly, he was SO attentive.  Especially since one of our diners is gluten-free, lactose intolerant.  He guided us through the menu, made great recommendations, even went back to confer with the chefs to be sure everything was done correctly.  We each ordered the taco trios, an array of different smells, proteins, veggies graced our table.  Each of us having a favorite.  It was topped off with warm, sugary churros accompanied with a chocolate dipping sauce, on the house for our birthday boy.  We will definitely be back.  We enjoy that part of town, seeing old buildings (used to be Humpty Dumpty's Restaurant) coming alive.  Oh, and ask for Jeremy.  Hope he sticks around.",0.0

"Cam here with 16 other friends during Nuit Blanche because scaddabush next door was full. I like that it's easy to get a last minute seating for that many people. It seems to be a very loud sports bar. One of those places that you go and have a drink before going to clubs. Ordered the clam chowder as an appetizer. I was expecting it to be thick and creamy, but it seems to have more water than cream. So, that was disappointing. Then, I got the lamb for my main course. It was just a standard slow cooked lamb. Boring and unoriginal. Taste is ok, but it feels expensive paying $50 or so for dinner when served something that boring. I doubt that I will be coming back unless I'm eating with a big group.",0.0

Staff was friendly and made sure to refill your tea\/water every now and then. There's a section off to the side at the back where you can purchase their chocolates, truffles, and other gifts. Good idea for even more business.

Not a huge fan of their macarons, but their packaging is quite cute; could make for a nice gift. (I think if you order take out for macarons from their menu, it will come with a chocolate Eiffel Tower). 

Their spicy ginger crème brulee has pretty good ginger flavor; the scorched sugar on the top wasn't too burnt or overdone either, which some places tend to do. A weird combo but surprising dish.

The Green tea and special white chocolate cheese cakes were really rich; the portion is good since it's not too big or small. The graham layer on the bottom was a nice consistency: not too moist or dry. It was a bit sweet however so it made the overall dessert a bit too sweet.

Their chocolate banana strawberry crepe was beautifully presented and didn't skimp out on the strawberries or bananas. However, crepes are pretty easy to make at home so don't think I'll be coming back for this one.

NYPD's pizza is crisp and refreshing, a phrase which I've never used to describe pizza before.  Isn't this type of food supposed to weigh you down and make you swear you'll start your diet tomorrow?

Other Yelpers have complained about the service, but it was spectacular in my opinion.  Maybe they've made some changes recently.  The vast majority of the waiters looked like firefighters (okay, that's probably the uniform, probably supposed to look like the police, plus the fact that Arizona people look slightly different from the Miamians I'm used to), and they were super friendly and on top of things despite the increasing number of customers.

The biggest draw back was the flavors. We got the 5 taco sampler and tried mushroom, chicken, pork and beef. Chicken and beef were both pretty good with fresh ingredients.

Always at very reasonable prices telling me exactly what I was paying for and how much the parts were. After what I thouhgt was a up grade to a 2010 Chevy Malibu Steve continued to work on that. Unfortunately that car had MORE then a few problems! Steve did fix a few things on it, but he finally said enough is enough telling me I shouldn't keep putting money in that car. Now I've got a 2012 Chevy Sonic and I trust Steve to work on that too.

"Big fan of places you can throw things on the ground, but usually it's the places that only have peanuts. Here at Savory, it's entirely different. They have racks all about where there are spices galore - many of which you cannot even fathom.

What's more, nearly all of them have a sampler (it's like a game to find the ones without) where you can open and smell, and if you are so interested, you can shake it into your hand and have a taste. Whatever is left you can dump onto the floor. If you can imagine, all those smells, throughout the course of the day, end up in an amazing bouquet of scents. It's pretty awesome.

There are also a few tasty treats, including the candied ginger up front, and you can usually find a few recipes as well. There are occasionally even classes at the shop, and they will dispense your chosen spice in just about any size, from a tiny bit all the way up to a massive jar. So you have no excuse to not get to cooking!",0.0
I have purchased 3 RVs from JW over the last 13 yrs and have been extremely happy with sales and especially service.  We bought a new Class A MH last Sept and the one my wife fell in love with was not a brand JW sold.  We were unhappy with the service we received from the place we had to take it and were overjoyed when Ed called to me to let me know JW is now a full warranty service center for Thor.  The MH will not go to anyone else if we are in the valley and need any kind of maintenance.,0.0
"Yum!
Stopped in after a WestWorld event. This was some seriously good pizza. The crust was crisp and the sauce and toppings were good. Just the right amount of cheese.

It seemed like they were a little unorganized, which we later found out that they've just re - opened. There are still a few timing kinks to work out, but the food was delicious. I had a couple of slices and the hubs had wings.

These slices were so good that I can't wait to try a whole pie! Unfortunately they aren't nearby our home, but this won't be my last WestWorld event so I'll be back.

"Not too long ago I had a horrible experience at Auto Nation Nissan which left me with a 2010 Honda Civic that had 115,000 miles on it at the time of purchase. I was going to bring the car in to have some repairs on it done (I was actually looking at over $1,000 in repairs that would be needed shortly) when i got a call from Christian saying they were looking to buy Honda Civics just like mine.

I was pretty skeptical at first, but knowing the mileage and amount for repairs coming up, I went to talk to him. He was actually busy with a customer when I arrived so he handed me over to Sa'ad. Sa'ad was very respectable and did his best to work within my budget. Although he tried to sell me on a new car, I held my ground and eventually got him to show me over to the pre-owned lot. I found a 2013 Honda Civic around what I was looking to pay monthly.

So far both him and Christian have checked in to see how I like the car and have also offered assistance to me on the purchase. Although my previous experience with AutoNation left me wary of dealerships, Sa'ad did not pressure me and left me feeling like I had made the right decision.",0.0

"Okay Beer was cold I can say that after that I was somewhat taken back by the lack of a lunch crowd. I tried their small spinach salad I can say it didn't come close to the picture ( nice candied pecans abound) not on this salad. Okay here is the simplicity of the salad spinach, feta cheese, chopped candied pecans, dried cherries, cut apples - balsamic dressing ( you can do this at home). Sat at the bar alone meaning the server taking care of the bar was working the floor friendly but not at the bar so my service suffered. Really leaning on the NOT returning side of the fence. Maybe if back in the area, really wasn't a warm fuzzy feeling. Did get a cold beer though! Sure a fancy place for very basic food at a price. No up selling not the best experience - so I would say try it and if it works for you great otherwise I did share my dime's worth.",0.0

However I found the food average and very tiny. Nothing to rave about. Expensive, tiny and leaves you wanting more and still hungry. Not sure I'll be back anytime but was a nice try. As an appetizer it's ok but as a meal definitely not filling. I think It's a cute little place and if I'm ever in Chinatown and walking by I wouldnt rush to come back .",0.0

"Since, in my opinion, all Sephora stores are the same, I'm using my review of the downtown store as a basis for this review.

Location: In the Fairview mall on the West Island. 

The place: It's quite large, but smaller than the downtown store. The layout makes me feel like I'm wandering through some kind of cosmetic labyrinth. That said, you can usually move around pretty easily unless the place is packed

The stuff: Sephora is bloody well-stocked with most major cosmetic brands, as well as brands I've never heard of. You'll find make-up, fragrances, some body products and assorted tools to make yourself real purty. I give them bonus points for carrying one of my favorite brands - Fresh, straight out of NYC. Also, if you're looking for travel-sized fragrances, this is the place to get them.

Service: The floor is usually well 'stocked' with clerks who will offer you bags for everything they want you to buy. However, unlike the downtown sore, I wasn't greeted or offered a bag. In fact, the service was non-existent. Guess it's a good thing I knew exactly what I needed and where to find it. 

Price: It will really depend on what you're buying. We all know that certain brands are overpriced so if you're going for Lancôme or YSL, you'll pay through the nose, however if you opt for something like the Sephora brand, you'll pay a little less. One thing is certain - you'll almost always find what you're looking for.

Bonus: If you get the Sephora card, you'll accumulate points that can be redeemed for products. The more points you have, the better the product.",0.0

"The pizza is delicious and takes ONLY 90 seconds to cook. One of the major problems I have is that it's a ""subway"" type process for personalizing your pizza, so it can take an extremely long time before it's your turn to start customizing your pie. There are so many options, most people get confused and freeze up like a hot breadstick was just shoved up their ass. The ordering flow is just horrible and it only allows for one employee to make the pizzas while the rest of the employees stand around looking stoned. I also don't suggest calling in for pick up. If so, expect the pizza to be incorrect. If you can manage to arrive when there is absolutely no line, you will definitely enjoy the pizza.",0.0
"I bought carpet for three rooms in my home, and applied for credit to do so. For some reason, my credit was run three times, my cosigner's was run twice, and the account was incorrectly set up in the name of the person who was to be my cosigner and not in my name. Additionally, Empire placed a second temporary authorization on my account which made it look on my credit report as if the balance on the account was twice the actual balance. 

In the process of attempting to correct this problem, Empire placed a THIRD temporary authorization on my account which then made it look as if my account was charged up almost to the limit, causing my credit score to drop another 15 points, and in turn affecting the amount I was charged for a new auto insurance policy. Empire told me that the issue was with my bank and they needed to fix it, and of course the bank told me that they could not fix the problem without a call from Empire because they had placed the authorizations on the account. Every time I called Empire, I was told by the agent and that she would immediately call the corporate office and they would fix the problem, but the erroneous charges continued to remain on my account month after month, while I was being told that the issue had been fixed. The bank confirmed with me that they had not once heard from Empire. When I realized I was not going to get any resolution dealing with the local office, I called the corporate office who told me they would get a supervisor on the line to help me and then connected me right back to the local office. It took five months of going round and round with Empire being unwilling to acknowledge the problem was indeed NOT resolved before I decided to call the bank again and see if they could help me.  The bank agent suggested I get Empire on the line and try a three-way call, but in order to get Empire to agree to it, I had to threaten legal action. Once the issue was finally resolved, I needed to carpet additional rooms and asked if they would be willing to apply a discount to a new purchase. I was told that a manager would have to be consulted and that I would receive a call back. No one ever called me back; not even to say, ""I'm sorry, we can't do that"".

Against my better judgment I chose to go ahead and have Empire install carpet in the remaining rooms.  I had to reschedule the install to coordinate with a furniture delivery, but reaching the scheduling office is impossible.  The calls go straight to voice mail, and no one ever returns the call. I finally called the sales rep directly who, thankfully, was able to reschedule the install. When they called to give the timeframe in which they would be arriving, the time they gave me was the time that I said I would be unavailable. The woman corrected herself in the voice message and said the crew would arrive after 10:30, which is what I requested, but did not give me a timeframe. So I had no idea if they were going to arrive shortly after 10:30 or at the end of the day. Again, when I tried to reach them, my calls went straight to voicemail and I received no call back. I received the requested 30 minute heads-up call at a time when I was unable to answer the phone, but no voice mail was left and I was therefore unable to return the call to see if it was the installer. Fifteen minutes later the office called to tell me that the installers were already at my house. 

Empire's prices may or may not be reasonable, I can't really attest to that because my original need in getting carpet was to have it installed quickly so price was a secondary factor. The better companies needed much more lead time to get the job done or I would have used one of them. But after five months of going round and round with the credit issue and having to pay a higher price on my auto insurance for the next year as a result, there is no way on this earth that I would ever recommend Empire to anyone.  Dealing with this company tops the list of absolute worst customer service experiences EVER.  My suggestion - steer clear of Empire.",0.0
"My friend and I were really excited to see this show as we're both Penn and Teller... but sadly, the show left a bit for both of us to desire. The ""magic"" in the show was good... but there was just waaaay too much talking during the show. Also, the ""wow"" factor wasn't there... at times it felt like a lecture by Penn with Teller doing the tricks...

Having seen a good portion of the shows in Vegas... this show just didn't quite cut it for me...

The magic they do is more of up-close magic, not suited for a theater of their size. My friend and I have been to the Magic Castle many times in LA and all that is close up magic in an intimate setting. In a big theater like where Penn and Teller were performing, you expect more ""big"" things and for more of a show to be put on.  I did not feel like I was watching a magic show. The energy seemed supar. It's a good thing I was able to get tickets for about half off because I would be very upset paying full price!

The nice thing about this show is after, they literally run out... why, because they are outside doing a meet and greet for all their fans! They will take pics and sign stuff for you. I think that is pretty cool and humble of them!!

"There are only two good things about staying at the MGM Grand hotel in Vegas. The location and the bed. First of all the super gay employee who checked us in had an attitude when he told us there was a $200 fee to check in and we only had cash. I had no idea of the fee to begin with. Then we were never able to log in with their WiFi connection. Super complicated and it never worked not even offline my phone couldnt connect. I dont know if they have a signal jammer or what. The walk to the room was half a mile. I guess we made the mistake of staying when that loser miley cyrus was booked so the hotel and the parking lot was jam packed with the fall of americas future clogging up the hallways, elevators and parking garage.

"BOTTOM LINE - HORRIBLE, but read on of you're interested.

My entire family has been coming here since they opened years back. As of tonight, they have lost all of our business - which I might add would be several thousands annually.

The restaurant has been owned by a nice Chinese couple and up until recently had done well with the business. The quality of the food has taken a slide meaning, it's hit or miss. Tonight was mediocre at best. If Jenny or her husband are in working the kitchen and sushi bar, the food is usually fantastic and well worth the price. More often than not though, the husband seems uninterested and has other people doing the sushi bar for him. Needles to say on these nights the food is absolute crap, as it was tonight.

But we being a tolerant and nice bunch, can live with the hit or miss because we genuinely like the couple. Or did.

Tonight's experience was a nightmare for my wife and I who were the only people in the restaurant. We arrived at 9:15pm and promptly ordered. The food began to arrive at 9:30 and we started to eat. A waitress came to the table and told us that they were going to close the kitchen early and we needed to get our next AYCES order in right away. I told her we have barely had time to eat what was on the table and want ready to order the next round, and she walked away. Less than 5 minutes passes and the sushi chef came to us in a huff and demanded that we order right away because he wanted to clean. In an ignorant tone and manner I might add.

The owner (husband) was standing by watching and I asked him what was going on and when this horrible attitude came about. He stayed silent, as if he were afraid of annoying his own staff. I asked him who was running the place and still, silent. I told him that if this is how the place is being run, he would lose my business and everyone connected to me. At that moment the waitress comes in and said that was wrong for me to say and that I wasn't nice.

I'm still in shock that someone would throw good business down the drain just because the staff want to leave early because it's slow. We all have bad days. I have worked very successfully in the hospitality industry for nearly 30 years and a successful restaurant is built upon many things including consistency and reliability that the place will be open for business, even when the day is off.

Jenny and husband - thank you for many years of AYCES and I wish you well. But for myself and my dozen or so family members that eat at your restaurant on a regular basis - will never be back.

The service from the waitress (Caucasian woman) is horrible. The quality of rolls and sushi that your chef made tonight was horrible as most of it was faking apart while plated. Not forgetting to mention that he is an ignorant little prick and the owner standing there looking at me as if I had two heads. Maybe I did. It is Halloween afterall.",0.0

"Tried this place as it was close to my home and was given good reviews. Ordered the 16"" with pepperoni and half sausage and pepperoni. Got a free order of garlic bread for Yelp check-in. Garlic bread was not good. The bread seemed stale with loads of butter and a hint of garlic. Good thing it was free. Pizza was better, but nothing special. I don't eat pizza normally so when I do I want it to be memorable. Unfortunately this was not the case. If I was at a party and this pizza was served, I would eat it. However, I probably won't buy this pizza for dinner any time soon. Really wanted it to be great because it's a family owned joint. Glad other Yelpers like it, though...",0.0

Chicken Piccatta was very good. Veal special was equally good. House salad dressing was described to me by the waiter as "" a balsamic vinegrette with dry bleu cheese crumbles"". Perfect for me and my guest. When the bill came they charged us $1.50 each for dry bleu. I always order dry bleu and I always pay extra for it with no problem. But he described it as part of the dressing and that bugs me. So if I had ordered the Sun-dried tomato dressing on my salad, would I have been charged extra for sun-dried tomatoes?

"Today was a bloody mary sort of day for me.  My husband and I stopped off at a high end restaurant first where I ordered my usual bloody mary with extra olives.  The bartender gave me an average drink with three little anorexic olives on a pick.  Later in the day it was hot and we wanted to stop for cocktails again.  We sort of stumbled upon Serendipity.   The a\/c was going and the Dodgers game was on TV so we chose to sit at the bar.  Jesse was our bartender and I placed my usual order.  His Bloody Mary was top notch!  Full of flavor, fresh delicious and he by the way heard my request for extra olives.  I got six firm extra large olives (2 picks of 3 BIG olives!)!!!!!  I asked how did he get so much flavor in there.   He said their vodka is infused with peppers, onions & celery and pointed to the large decanter with fresh veggies floating inside. Delish!  Great job Jesse, we will be back!!!!",0.0
Seats were old & busted. Restaurant had a strong bleach smell. I ordered the Ultimate Nachos with steak and it was more like #NachoFail.

I wont tell ya about the other things I saw that I wanted though.  You'll have to look for yourself.  Which is pretty fun to do, I say.  If these items could tell you their stories I'm sure there would be enough to make another Forrest Gump movie.  As a mid-century junkie, I don't  find their prices to be too high at all.  Some booths are quite reasonable, as you will also find some booths that think they are the Antique Roadshow or something.  The best part of Vintage Vegas is the variety of items to browse through.

"As far as an airline goes I would categorize Southwest as serviceable.  They get you to where you want to go.  However, you have to be sure that you check in online 24 hours prior to your flight or else you are doomed to having to check your bag.  Why?  Because they pack people in like sardines and if you fail to check in you will be last on the plane and there will no be spots to place your bag.

Contrary to Dark Horse, the café that I visited earlier in the day, this place played more Shoegazery music.  So the atmosphere was a bit more chill as opposed to lively 'n social.

Had a Cappuccino and it had a nice, thick crema.  Very smooth.  I hope that I'm not losing my tastebuds, but aside from the crema, it's difficult for me to say which café was better.  The only difference seemed to be the atmosphere.

An employee that works at this salon posted an ad for hair salon services.  She was busy with another customer so I waited for her.  The other two hair stylists bickered back and forth about how much she was charging for my hair service in front of me for about an hour.  I finally asked if there was a problem with me waiting for her.  I told them I did not have a problem paying more which probably would have been $20 more if they had been professional about the whole thing.  I just couldn't believe how classless these stylist's were to talk about the whole thing in front of me like I wasn't there.

Als dieser ihren Geschmack nicht komplett traf, wurde er nachher NICHT berechnet, sondern ging trotz unserem Widerspruch aufs Haus.

Aber das Tollste war: da ich anstelle von Kaffee einen Obstbrand bestellt hatte, schleppte der Chef nach dem zahlen noch eine Sammlung feinster Brände an unseren Tisch, nötigte uns, diese zu probieren, und erzählte so von der keinen Brennerei, dass seine Begeisterung auf uns übersprang.

"Had lunch at this place Sept 19 wanted to see if the hype is really true bought 2  Italian beef combos, 1 with hot peppers the other with sweet peppers, small fry and drinks. I asked for wet since I'm used to Portillo's beef sandwich wet with au jus. These beef sandwiches were not fit for man or beast, it was extremely salty and the pepper looked like a mix of sports pepper and sriracha and the texture of the beef looked like reconstituted beef jerky. I took 2 bites to make sure it wasn't a fluke but the entire filling and gravy tasted like it was made with salt brine. The fries were soggy and greasy. I took the order back to the pick up counter and asked for a manager to tell them the food was inedible but all I got was a counter person taking my food and dumping it in trash can no one bothered to make things right so I took the other sandwich and tossed in the trash where it belongs!!!!!!!!

"This Gold's is a pretty good gym..for the price. I just have the cheapest membership, which is all I need. When you join they do snake a few charges on you that you don't expect but everybody who gets your credit card does that nowadays don't they? Basic membership probably comes out to around $170 a year and that's not bad at all. 

I've been to this Gym around 40 times in the last couple of months. I've never seen any member nor staff clean the equipment so make sure you wipe down before your set. They do have staff clean the facility, empty trash, fix broken equipment which is the way it should be. 

The Gym gets very crowded at times, I think the local football team got a discount to workout there lol. So yeah, on weeknights there's a bunch of high schoolers ""working out"" their smartphones trying to be cool in front of their friends. Still, when it's super crowded I can usually get my workout in, I just have to be flexible and creative. If the place was empty it'd be really boring so there's always a positive spin to everything. 

Almost everybody behaves and they're willing to share equipment. There's no problem with the staff, they are definitely friendly which is a big plus. 

Overall, I give this Gym 3 Stars. It's a good gym with a lively atmosphere and you can get your workout in with relative ease. I'd give it a higher rating if they(somebody\/anybody) cleaned the equipment and if they didn't sneak all those charges within the first couple of weeks. You just know they'll add some hidden charges at the end too.",0.0

"Alright, first off, this is not a restaurant you go to and expect to eat your own meals. This restaurant is meant to be a really fancy take on family dinner. The food comes out on small plates in modest portions abs you are encouraged to share. So you are also encouraged to get a few plates of food not just one for yourself to enjoy as you would in a normal restaurant. 

All that being said, this place is really good. With the portion sizes being small it isnt overwhelming and you don't leave over full. We had the chicken skewers, shrimp, Angus, and the benigets. 

The chicken came on skewers with little toasted pita slices with a taziki sauce. (like the stuff you get on gyros) the chicken was moist and the sauce very good. 

The shrimp was wonderful and the sauce was very creole in taste but not overly spicey.

The Angus came out about the size of a fist and cut into two pieces. It also was very flavorful but wasn't cooked as well as I could have been I think.


The benigets were small abs round, like a Mexican wedding cake, and came with a chocolate sauce, raspberry jam and a cream sauce I cannot place. All were just wonderful. 

So if you're looking for something a little different with delicious food this is a good place to eat. If you're super hungry and not wanting share go someplace else.

"I don't usually TIP for a carwash since they have already charged me extra for being ""oversized"" (the Truck, not ME) however........today I scraped off some old window stickers and then went to Foothills Full Service Car Wash corner of Ray Rd & I-10 in the JCP parking lot.

"There was no wait but we did go in at 11pm. We owed the Sage Chicken and Waffles to share and we still didn't finish it as it was enormous as other yelpes have stated regarding their portion size. In sure it could have easily fed 2 adults and 2 small children or 3 adults and still be filling.  The price was decent concidering the actual size of the meal but that's pretty much all your paying for as the services was just okay. The presentation of the meal was great and almost floored me when it came out because of how much food was on the plate. The chicken was good if you like A LOT of batter. I felt it needed a little something for me to make it stand out a bit more but all in all not bad.  The four heavy waffles included in the meal had bacon slices cooked in it which was nice but really if I didn't see it while eating it, I wouldn't have even noticed it was there since the waffle itself over powered it in flavor.",0.0

This is good new york style pizza. I dont even care for that style but i love a good pie when i get one. The garlic knots are very good. It reminds me of a pretzel more then a bread stick. Very good. If you like new york style then i must say this is good pie,0.0

Was walking to be seated and there was kids running everywhere. We had to walk down the stairs by the slide to go to our table and one kid tripped and was almost stepped on and another child pushed me oitnof the way. Finally was seated and our waiter otook ten minutes to get our drink order and we received our salads before our drinks! The food was AWEFUL! I am no food snob but my chicken was dry. Oh and if you like your meal decided for you, this is the place unless you want to pay up. Your entree comes only wit sweat potatoes, gross, steamed vegetables, from a frozen veggie bag, and corn on the cob that has been sitting all day in water. Barf.

"It's like a whole new place in here. I didn't realize it'd been that long since we were here last but the restaurant went through a remodel...it's really nice. It's almost a little too nice where I feel like it might not be casual enough to bring my kids too. 

There was a 30 min wait when we came at 630 on a Saturday, so not completely unexpected. What was unexpected was how long it took to get our appetizer..again 30 mins..it got a little worrisome with two hungry boys. Our server Dynelle was apologetic about the wait and even though we put the kids order in right away, it still took quite awhile. 
As for the food, I had the royal red robin and it was a royal mess! The taste of the burger was good but it completely fell apart after two bites and I ate it in pieces. We also had a bowl of chicken tortilla soup and there was hardly any chicken in it.

I can handle long waits, taking a long time to fill our order, and the quality of the food but the one thing that really bothered me about our visit tonight was that the arrangement of the dining room made it so difficult for the servers to get through the aisle that twice they almost knocked into our daughter in the highchair on the end. The new big chairs for the long tables took up so much space in the aisle that the servers had a  such a hard time navigating around them when they carrying the big trays.

Hotel room is very nice, modern, new and clean, however, there is only one tiny gift shop and few restaurants.  The self parking is really really long walk and for female guest like me is very scary to walk there even during the day time co silts isolated. Elevator is dirty and dark. Saw graffiti and strange people are hanging around and loud loud music are being played at somewhere. And most of all it's very dirty. Worst of all, parking ticket machine cannot read guest park bar code so far we had to pay $5 and $9 for two nights. And we are about to go home, I'm sure we have to pay again for the 3rd time, even front desk said should be fine after failed twice. They said something wrong with the parking machine. So in order for us to get credit we have to charge to room for some expenses, but since it's a promotion stay and room is comped we had to force ourselves to buy coffees and so but still not enough to cover to get credit full amount.  So we will eat these parking fees at this time . I know it's free to stay what is a big deal for some, but it's a basic service issue and still I am not happy with this situation. 

Well,  I could have used the valet in that case but I go out and back and force bet . hotel and stores and shops for 4-5 times a day, paying the $2-3 tips each time will cost more. Bit I guess since the parking situation was so bad I should have used the valet......bit I have no issue with other hotels at downtown.

"It's hard to find something wrong with Pizza Libretto. I currently live near the Ossington and Dundas area so when I feel like a baller and wanting to opt out of a standard grease pie a la Dominos\/Pizza Hut\/ Pizza Pizza I will normally call Libretto and order pickup. i usually go with the Ontario Prosciutto and add on their pepperoni made in house. The chili sauce that the pizza comes with is solid and should be requested. They do Neopolitan style stone oven pizza that if doing pickup, can literally have a pie ready for you as soon as 5 - 8 min after you order. My only real issue is the price. I would get Libretto everytime I crave pizza if it wasn't for the 23 bucks I have to shell out for something that only feeds one person. If this were Dominos, 25 bucks gives you a feast that will feed over three people (including their delicious ranch sauce). Like I said though, this place is so good and is certainly a step above the greasy fast food pizza joints that have polluted the industry.",0.0
I called ahead to inform the manager we would have a large party.  We brought our entire softball team and families here for lunch and they did a great job serving our group.  The servers were friendly and did their best to accommodate everyone.  We all had a fun time.  There are a lot of restaurants in the area and I wanted to choose a kid friendly place that had a large menu and Red Robin fit the bill. They even had softball and poker on TV which was a plus.  My fav is the turkey burger.  I like the fact they offer so many choices for sides not just french fries although their fries are excellent.  I also recommend the strawberry lemonade.,0.0
"We order here all the time since there isn't any other pizza place in Cross Plains.

"Worst club experience ever. I'm a Las Vegas local and have experienced many clubs here and abroad. Hakkasan tops my worst experience EVER (topping my Tao Nightclub birthday experience where it was so packed that people were spilling drinks and getting their clothes stuck on each other because they couldn't move 5inches). This was my third attempt at trying to get in. The first time, the line was outside the casino and the second time we made it all the way to the entrance only to be told it was $10 off the main price for those on the guestlist. 

My friends and I arrived early since we were on the guestlist for a promoter. We waited 3 hours to get to the coat check line, where we were notified it was MANDATORY ($5) to check in your coat. There was a huge discrepancy in regards to who thought a coat with buttons versus zippers qualified a coat check in or not (this applied to girls). We then had to get into another line to get in. When we finally make it in, the place was so packed you couldn't dance or mingle, much less stand any where remotely appropriate that didn't block traffic or get you moved because VIP tables where near by. 

If you want a fun club experience go to Marquee, XS, Tryst (even though it's small). It's too bad they have some awesome headliners for EDM. But they obviously didn't plan out the layout or considered those who aren't purchasing $500+ tables. Spend your money else where.",0.0

"This is possibly the worst ""mexican"" restaurant I have ever eaten at! Thankfully my fiance and I had our entrees comped as part of a show we were seeing, but even then I felt ripped off by what we did pay for (chips, salsa, guacamole, a margarita, and jalapenos in one of our burritos). There was zero spice, heat or flavor in any of the food, with no peppers in anything except the jalapenos we'd ordered, but even those had been deseeded and washed so they had no spice at all. There was only the barest hint of cilantro in the salsa, and the guacamole was essentially just mashed avocado with a pinch of diced tomatos and white onions thrown in. The burritos were poorly wrapped, falling apart immediately, and poorly assembled, with only a dollop of sour cream and guacamole in the very center of them, so the dominant flavors were of essentially unseasoned rice, beans and meat, the salsa only adding texture with no flavor or kick. The margarita tasted and felt like it had no tequila in it as well. We asked if they had spicier salsa and they did not. All in all this was the blandest, most unsatisfying mexican meal I have ever had, and it was vastly overpriced; the only positive thing I can say is that it was warm and took up space in my stomach.

"Back in February, my cousin came back from Montreal to visit. We wanted to have some quality time together so we decided to explore Toronto.

Jimmy's Coffee has portraits of all the famous people with the name Jimmy (or variation of it), such as Jim Carrey, Jimmy Fallon, Jimi Hendrix, etc. The owner is a fan of classic rock and Jimi Hendrix, hence the inspiration for the cafe.

The place was full when we arrived and we definitely saw how popular it was. Despite it being full, it was a quaint place, especially at the back of the cafe.

We will head back soon to try the savory ones.,0.0

I placed an online order on August  27th.  I was given $30 kohls cash which expired on Sept 1st.    My order won't arrive until Sept 5th.  I wanted to wait to spend the cash until I received the order and could accessorize.  I would have spent considerably more at that time.  Customer service would not reissue the kohls cash.  I will be returning the online order when it arrives and will not shop at kohls in the future.,0.0
"If you're staying in the MGM or NYNY, this is THE place for a night time snack to make the next morning feel less bad. It's open till forever and the slices are thick, big, and the right amount of greasy. The piano bar is next door so you'll be treating to some live music with your slice. Yes it's $5 for a slice and you'll need two but it's small price to pay for convenience and feeling ok the next morning. The whole pie is a much better deal but if you can wait the 25 minutes, you probably don't need it and can get a more quality pie elsewhere :)",0.0
"So, I finally tried this place after living in Arizona for 2 years... People out here in AZ say it's really good food for a drive thru hamburger joint.. I would agree. It is much better than McD's, Burger King, Wendy's, etc.. They only serve hamburgers, fries, drinks, and milkshakes. I guess that's why the burgers and fries they make are pretty rockin'!",0.0

"The outside and inside don't do the food justice. My husband had the chicken parmesan sandwich with chips and I went with the mussels appetizer and small side salad as my meal. The food takes a little longer probably Because they actually put some TLC into it. My mussels were cooked to perfection and had some high quality Parmesan cheese shaved on the top, yum-o! The portions are large and the mussels were more than enough for a large lunch. My husbands sandwich was probably as big as his head but didn't stop him from taking it down :)",0.0

My friend and I heard alot of good things about Hash House A Go Go so we had to try it out! Knowing it was opening late at night was a plus too! We went there after a long night of partying. We ordered the Chicken Benedict and the Chicken and Waffles and shared both. 

We got the chicken benny first and my lord it was amazing! My taste buds were on another level! My mouth is watering just thinking about it now haha. This had a layering of heaven! It has mashed potatoes on the bottom, with a huge piece of fried chicken on top of it, then hardwood smoked bacon, tomato, mozzarella, scrambled eggs with chipotle cream sauce on top.. HEAVEN! 

Shortly after we got the Fried Chicken & Waffles. It has two fried chicken breasts with hardwood smoked bacon waffle tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks. By this time we got pretty full and only finished halfway and packed the rest to go. The portions were huge and sooooo good!

"The service here was awful. My friend and I were immediately greeted and taken to a table. Our drink order was taken and then nothing. Eventually our drinks came, after about ten minutes. This was also a Sunday night and it was NOT busy. We were two of about 8 people in the entire bar area.

Then we put in an appetizer order. Two more friends came to join us. They received their drinks, but no appetizers. At this point it had been a half an hour. Another person comes and ask us to refresh his memory about the order. Fifteen minutes later, we received our appetizer. What?!  45 minutes for southwestern rolls. Yeah.

We asked about drink specials and were told about them. We both ordered off the special menu. At the end of the night, we learned that the special was a little different than what we were quoted. Normally not a big deal but never in my life has it taken the better part of an hour for four drinks and an appetizer.

"This place is ok, but I'm giving it 2 stars because of the set up which makes this place not worth going. The lines are extremely long. So you will stand there for an hour plus waiting. There are 3 different stations that you can line up for which serve different meats. The problem is that once you are lined up for one station there is no way you can go to the next station unless you get in line for that one which is another long wait. So if you are coming in groups each person can be split into different stations. Another thing these tacos are good but they are very greasy i couldnt eat as many because of the grease. Another thing is that those poor workers are so overworked. I feel sorry for them. They need more people, you see them in hypermode. I think unfair working conditions.  Not going back.",0.0

The hostess was a bit short with us, mind you we were a little late but still! The waitress was excellent though, so overall service I thought was pretty good! 

There are lots of vegetarian options and they arranged all the vegetarian sushi pieces on one plate separate from the fish pieces. The waitress was careful to mention items with fish sauce or eggs in them for my friend.

Of the cooked food, the crispy beef and satay beef were delicious!  The pad Thai took a while to come and it was also good. Sauce was tangy, noodles were thin but not over cooked in the least.

Sashimi was very fresh, with an average variety available. The beef tataki was a little thick and only OK but quite tasty.

"Only scoring a two star because the food was edible and the vibe of the place was very cool. After spending a lot of dough on an amazing meal at STK the night before we decided on a more casual less expensive (or so we thought!) one. Todd English has gotten a lot of buzz on Top Chef so why not? Well this is why not: the food was ridiculously overpriced, carelessly made and couldn't hold a candle to any nickel and dime pub in Great Britain for a tenth of the cost. My $20 plate of corned beef was so cold I had to send it back, when it came back the flavor wasn't even up to Costco's high standard and the cioppino tasted like a pile of boiled seafood doused with a canned spaghetti sauce. I nearly spit up a gold tooth when I saw the bill was $87 before the tip!! $20 for one beer flight of four tiny tastes? Really? The only thing I enjoyed about my meal was the French onion soup but beware for $9 it'll be half the size of the one you are used to. This place is a miss for me.

"The hairdressers are all very young and inexperienced, with no older folk to guide them or show them how to cut hair.  I tried to explain how my ends need to be cut, but neither of the two employees had ever heard of such a thing.  I have had this certain type of cut from a few different hairdressers, and it's perfect for my type of hair.  I have had some other hairdressers insist on something else, and it always looks horrid.  I am open to certain changes, permutations, and differences here and there, but there is a specific way that the ends of my hair really need to be cut.

So anyway, the two kids get together and decide that I'm crazy, and they convince me to let them do it ""the right way"".  I have to admit that it's my fault because it was Sunday afternoon, and I didn't feel like waiting for an appointment with a better establishment.  I just asked them to leave like an extra inch, just in case I needed to cut more to make it right.  They ended up giving me a very stupid-looking cut.  I actually had to cut it some more when I got home.  My home-cut involved standing backwards in front of a large mirror, holding a smaller mirror in my left hand, and using the scissors with my right hand.

Luckily, the skill level of the hairdresser was so low that there was not much for me to mess up.  It's just a straight line across the back.  Nothing was done to the sides, and she did not create a shape of any type along the back.  I paid thirty bucks with tip for a straight line that goes right across my back.

"Just finished having dinner here and the experience was pretty pleasant. I've been passing this restaurant for some time now but with Thai Thai just down the street, I've never popped in to check it out until now.
What I loved most about this place was the ambiance. It's very clean and quaint. It's not what you would expect compared to other restaurants that hardly have decor, or you'd rather order take out than to sit down.
My husband ordered the Panang curry with chicken. It wasn't anything spectacular but it was still pretty good (wasn't a fan of the peas), plenty of chicken. I ordered the crispy rice salad and I would not recommend it. It tasted like I was eating rice crispy cereal. Only good part was the dressing they give you on the side. I ate maybe a quarter of it and boxed up the rest. Best parts of the dinner was their Thai tea (they give you simple syrup on the side to sweeten yourself) and the mango and sticky rice for dessert (can't really go wrong with this dish).
Service was excellent. Very attentive and checked up on us frequently. Refilled water any chance they had.
It's not exactly the place I'd go when I'm really craving Thai food. But I'd probably go back because it's so near me and I want to check out the happy hour.

"So I have drove by this place many times so when I saw a groupon for them I decided to give them a try. The place is a little small, and one guy told us to find a table while another lady told us to wait for tables to be cleaned off. After the guy told us a second time to find a table we found one it was poorly cleaned off, we ordered our drinks and food, the waiter brought out fresh pita bread and an herb olive oil. I ordered the filet Mignon kabobs, they were delicious I was not crazy about the rice or the hummas but the kabobs made up for it. The waiter was not attentative at all we never got refills on our drinks and he never checked back with us until time to bring the bill to us. The crazy part is they were not busy so I am not sure as to why we were not attended to. My husband ordered the gyro and a shrimp kabob he also enjoyed his meal he said he was not crazy about the rice either. I think the biggest dissappointment was just the service not sure if I will come back to this place again.",0.0

My friend and I tried the Paul Mitchel school and got a botched hair cut at best. My hair was heavy and uneven. We went in there as we had a great experience in there prior and the senior stylist said she would do a correction hair cut for me. By the end I loved the haircut and they had me hooked!

"We had a tremendous experience working with Pro Irrigation Services and are thrilled with the quality and professionalism of their services, the results they promised and delivered, and -- most importantly to us -- with the care, dedication, and integrity they demonstrated throughout the process. We called them with an immediate need at the height of their peak season, as we were days away from hosting a family reunion when our irrigation system failed. Everyone with whom we dealt was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and dedicated, from Jennie and Josh in the office, to Tyler and crew on the front line. Tyler took considerable time to thoroughly analyze our system, troubleshoot the problem, and identify a range of cost options. With well-coordinated scheduling with the office, he guaranteed we would be ""party-ready"" in a matter of a few days. After choosing the option we could afford at the time, Tyler and crew worked like dogs to make this happen and they delivered everything they promised and more, working late into the evenings, buying tools to make the job go faster, ramping up staff, etc. Frankly, they made a dream come true for us. Not only did they deliver ""party-ready"" results, but our yard looks more beautiful now than it ever has, and we were able to achieve this cost-effectively, with the peace of mind of knowing we have a well-functioning backyard irrigation system. If you're looking for a company that truly values your business and will go out of their way to deliver promised results, we believe you'll find this with Pro Irrigation Services. We greatly appreciate their dedication and service, and offer our thanks and gratitude for a job really well done.",0.0
"Serving only tacos and tortilla chips, the best way I can think to describe this place is that it's sort of an uber-clean Mexican Subway sandwich shop with an interesting Nacho Libre atmosphere - there's even a life-like hooded wrestler mannequin positioned to greet you as soon as you walk in the door.

The tacos here are different than what I'm used to; different, but good.  Instead of strips of fajita meat, these tacos come with a finely shredded beef or chicken, which are marinated and served in a variety of seasoned broths, from mild to smoking hot.

The toppings, like cheese, lettuce, cilantro, and onions, are offered up Subway style, so you get just what you want in the exact amounts you want.  These are exceptionally tasty tacos, but they do need to be eaten fast, before the tortilla gets soggy from the broth.",0.0
"I got my hair cut with highlights and lowlights with Jude this past week.  It was my first time in Salon and can't say enough good things about her...  I had chosen her after reading so many fantastic reviews about her.  I am a licensed cosmetologist and did my due-dilligence in advance.  Am so happy and pleased with the outcome as she did a beautiful job on both cut & color.  It was important for me to have a good outcome as I was going out of town with my then, boyfriend and knew we would be taking pictures.  We left town within the hour of me leaving salon and he expressed how much he loved my hair.

"We stayed there for a few nights this week. Although the room was very nice, living room, two restrooms, and a couch, the hotel was in the middle of major construction. I called before booking, and the front desk told me that there was no construction going on....uhhh, ok. This was not true. The pool which is amazing by resort pool standards, is WAY to crowded, that is on a weekday!  You will NOT find seating if you go after 10 am. They simply do not accommodate people who want to lounge. Well...unless you want to pay 75-150$ for a lounge chair. So you have to stand....in the heat, holding your pina colada, or stay in the water. I payed a wopping 30$ to rent a locker too...I couldn't imagine ever paying that for a small locker that I could not even fit all our items in.  We hung out for two hours and left the pool area for good, and never went back. There isn't a food court, not like other hotels...there are many dining options, but you will have to walk to Luxor or Excalibur if you want to find an eatery thats fast and cheap.  My advice, if you want the distance from the strip...a busy wave pool, very high prices (everything is an additional price) and you like the smell of coconut, then this might be for you. You should probably wait to The Hotel is done being constructed...the loud ass jackhammer was really annoying.",0.0

"Allgemein
Mein Kollege und ich sind am Feierabend in Carls Brauhaus essen gewesen.
Obwohl das Restaurant gut besucht war bekamen wir schnell einen Platz an der Sonne mit Blick auf den Schlossplatz von Stuttgart.
Der erste positive Eindruck war allerdings sehr schnell verflogen. Meine Bewertung fällt dementsprechend negativ aus.
Bedienung
Nach 10 Minuten warten und nachdem die Bedienung mehrmals, ohne eine Bestellung aufzunehmen, an uns vorbei ging, beschlossen wir, uns aktiv zu machen, um wenigstens eine Bestellung abgeben zu können. Endlich nach 15 Minuten warten war es dann so weit. Wir konnten unsere Bestellung aufgeben. Trotz schwächelndem WLAN bei der Aufnahme der Bestellung geling uns das ganz gut Die Getränke kamen relativ zeitnah, jedoch wurde mir das falsche Bier gebracht. Ich erklärte, dass ich etwas anderes bestellt hatte. Die Bedienung wendete sich ab, mit dem Kommentar, dass dies ein Kommunitkationsfehler meinerseits war. Nicht die Aussage, die man erwartet, oder? Ich hätte mir eine Entschuldigung und ein Angebot gewünscht, ob man mir das bestellte Getränk bringen dürfte. Aber keine Anzeichen einer solchen Reaktion. Am Nachbartisch haben gleich mehrere Bedienungen die Bestellung nicht aufgenommen mit der Aussage, dass gleichzeitig 500 Gäste bedient werden müssen. Meine Meinung heißt hier klar: Wenn ich ein Restaurant für 500 Gäste eröffne, dann habe ich auch für Stoßzeiten ausreichend Bedienungen vorhanden.
Das Essen
Wir hatten Flammkuchen gegessen, den mein Kollege schon besser gegessen hatte und das Bauernschnitzel. Das Schnitzel für ca. 11€ war durchwachsen und trocken. Die dazugereichten Pommes waren extrem fettig. Ein kleiner Beilagensalat hat mir bei dem trockenen Schnitzel gefehlt. Zitrone war ca. 2€-Durchmesser groß und reichte gerade mal für einen Hauch von Zitronenduft. Gefallen hat mir das in einem Kunststofftöpfchen beigelegte Ketchup-Schälchen. Immerhin war das Essen warm.
Das Ambiente
Ambiente ist toll. Innen sehr modern und dennoch kommt Gemütlichkeit auf. Auf den Außentischen sehr toll. Die Abendsonne scheint die Gäste an und der Blick auf den Schlossplatz bringt schon fast Biergartenlaune. Das Ambiente hat definitiv Potenzial zum erfolgreichen Restaurant. Nach dem heutigen Tag reicht es meiner Meinung nach nur für ein Feierabendbier ohne Essen.

"Well, I am no stranger to Jewish Delis or Any deli for that matter! I would like to say I'm a connoisseur of sorts. So I was starving today and needed a place to eat. I have heard rave things about Weiss so I though ""I'll give this place a shot!"" I did just that!

It really is similar to the SoCal scene (i.e. Downtown Disney (minus the kid-factor), The Grove\/Americana and 3rd St Promenade. 

We weren't too impressed with this area TBH, but it is nice to have a buffer between The Quad\/Linq and Harrahs.",0.0
"I've been a fan of this place since 2008, I moved away a couple of years ago and missed the food. They just opened this new location close to home. I'm surprised it wasn't busier although it was a Monday night. The food is still very good but prices are higher but they are everywhere these days and I say it's worth it for fresh healthy ""faster"" food. The staff is friendly and helpful. I hope this place does well and stays in the area fire a long time. Download their app and get free items.",0.0
"This place has the cheapest threading\/waxing I have ever seen. The lady who runs it is super friendly and nice. They accept walk-ins which I have always done, and I've never had to wait more than two minutes to get my eyebrows threaded. They have a loyalty card that if you get 6 services done, you get the 7th free. Eyebrows are $7 and if you pay in cash, you don't pay tax. So you can get your eyebrows threaded 7 times for $42, which will get you about 4 threads at other places. My roommate gets her waxing done here too and she loves it. Nothing but positives to say.",0.0

"I'm gonna thank this place right here for preventing a hangover that im sure i earned.  After a night of drinking a little tofu soup and rice was just what the doctor ordered.  Even the soju and beer that I ended up consuming here could overcome the tofu from soaking up all that ailed me.  The food was really good.  Better then I expected from a Vegas Korean place.  They had all the side dishes that you expect and everything was brought out in a timely matter.  Also open 24\/7 is a nice touch.

Bottom line.  If your wasted in Vegas and need something to soak up the poison this is the place for your Korean medicine.  If they had fried fish also it would be 5 stars easy.",0.0
"I tried Pearl Sushi for the first time this past Saturday. The first thing I noticed was the service. It was Saturday afternoon, and they were not very crowded however, the hosted greeted us with a warm smile, and seated us on the outside patio. The waiter came right over with waters, and asked for our drink orders(NO Blue Moon.)  I started with the maguro sashimi, six pieces, pretty standard for most sushi restaurant; it was fresh and delicious. We also had their Dragon and Rainbow rolls, both were also very good. Being new to the area, and Pearl being SO conveniently located I will definitely be back.",0.0
"This is a great place for shopping if you want trendy, cheap clothes (that will be out of style in a few seasons). But for selling, DO NOT GO HERE. I brought over the majority of my closet, which includes Anthropologie, Charlotte Russe, Hollister, etc. And all I was offered was $6 for three shirts and a pair of flats. One of the shirts was Anthro, so I kept that and the shoes, and ""sold"" the other two items for $3. Ironically, I had tie-dyed one of them (and they accepted that but not all of my other stuff). The reason behind most of my items being declined was because they were too ""old,"" even though the high-end items had been purchased within a year, and the rest were basics that would fit any season. In addition, the sales associates threw my clothes on the dirty floor as if they were trash, and then placed my used (read: dirty) shoes on top of them. I was paid $3 to drive half an hour and back, and watch my great quality stuff be treated like garbage. I understand doing business, but that was plain disrespectful and unnecessary. The ladies who helped me were very nice, but that paled in comparison to the rest of my trip.",0.0

"What a disappointment! I used to really enjoy some things about this place years ago. We went back for the once-delicious pot roast nachos. This appetizer used to be very good but this experience was much different. It started with stale bread, continued with a soggy, cold excuse for the signature nachos, and got worse, ending with subpar entrees. The meat in the steak salad had been heated-up from being cooked some earlier time and the bacon wrapping around the shrimp kebab was not crispy or even fully cooked. The rice pilaf quality was equal to that of a frozen TV dinner. I left two stars because the service was ok and I'm hoping this was an off-night for this place, for their sake. I won't be returning anytime soon to find out.",0.0
"My fiancé and I ate here earlier in the week with the family. The service was excellent, and everything was spotless. My only complaint is that I didn't care for any of the food. I ordered the Bison Burger, which came on a dry flax seed bun, with flavorless sweet potato hash. My fiancé ordered the Mediterranean Salad with no meat, and the portion was very small and not very filling. Her salad was $11, and my entree was $16. I understand the restaurant's concept and I think it's great, but I think there should be better options for those who don't want an extremely clean meal. A beef burger with some deep fried french fries would be preferred! All in all, a great option for clean eaters and those with dietary restrictions, but not for the rest of us who eat whatever we want!",0.0
"I finally stopped and tried this place after driving past it many times and smelling the fantastic aroma from the giant grill in front of the place. They were grilling some chicken and they had some seats set up while you wait for your order to be filled and can watch TV.....(playing current movies in theaters)....I tried 3 Asada Tacos for $1 each and gave him a $2 tip and all I can say is WOW, they were excellent. Each taco had a large portion of meat and some cilantro and onions and for only $1 each I can say I was surprised at how much they served for such a low price. Put on some fresh salsa and some grilled onions and peppers from the serving tray and feasted on a great meal. Thank you Pollo Mobile, I will be making this a weekly stop now.....",0.0

"The food is about what you'd find at any burrito place. I didn't think the food was head and shoulders above Moe's or Chipotle. I'm going with 4 stars for a few reasons. First is that it's a local establishment, and I enjoy supporting those. The service was quick and friendly. The ""Hot Mama"" salsa is better than the regular hot sauce found at most. Lastly, on a warm day, I enjoyed sitting out on the patio with the Lynx gliding by and people watching in South End. That is more enjoyable than overlooking a strip mall parking lot at the chain burrito places. Overall, I recommend Phat Burrito and would go here more often if I didn't live so far from South End.",0.0
"We went with a party of 10 for a post work event.  The staff and waiter could not have been nicer or more welcoming.   The location is perfect if you are staying at the JW Marriott.  They made some great recommendations for appetizers. Almost everyone at the table went with different cuts of steak, everyone enjoyed it.  The only minor complaint was for folks who ordered medium the steak was still fairly rare.   The portions were large and the presentations were quite nice.  The pace of the food was perfect, not rushed but not too slow.  After appetizers and the entree we were all way too full for desert.",0.0
"#YELP #WINGS #TORONTO

Understaffed - this place is pretty much one man run. The guy who took our order was the same guy who went into the kitchen for the next 25 minutes and then brought our food out. Then, instead of checking in on us, he spent the next hour or so cleaning up the page and waiting other tables. My glass of water did not get refilled. #disappoint

My colleagues and I chose to stumble into this place because it looked cheaper than the other restaurants in the neighborhood. Primarily chosen because we'd already spent $$$ on drinks that evening. 

PRICE
This place is fairly cheap, but then again, for a place that charges as much as any other popular wing place (i.e. Wild Wings) could probably do a better job. 

FOOD
Despite the name, they do offer mild wings. Some of the menus have an added sticker that say ""New Flavor - Butter Chicken"" ... Piqued my interest and that's what I ordered; definitely not worth it. They came dry, unsaucy, with a wierd curry masala taste.  

ONE DAMN THING
The fries were embarrassingly good. Hence the 2 star.

ONE OTHER DAMN THING
When I ordered a glass of water for my ""drink"" the server totally looked heaven bound and let out the longest sigh. #rude

SPACE
Surprisingly big. But fairly run down.

"This was a pretty good buffet.  We got there around 5 so just before dinner time rush.  It is a kind of weird set up where you wait in line to buy the buffet then get into another line to wait to be seated.  All in all took us 10-15 minutes to be seated.  The buffet is separated by region.  There is Italian, Mexican, soup, salad, Greek, seafood and dessert.  There was some good food and some not so good food but all in all it was tasty.  The service was pretty slow but they only had one server covering a large area. At one point a server and bus boy were having an argument and management had to come out and take care of it.  They handled everything right out on the floor which I thought was neither the time not place for that right next to our table.",0.0

It's a great place but it's not the best sushi place I've ever been too but definitely much better than other places I've been to, AYCE or not. Will definitely keep coming back.",0.0
My whole family and I love this place! You walk in sit whenever you'd like or you can make a Togo order. The staff is always friendly and accommodating. They have old 6 packs on the table that house their condiments and hold up their paper menus. This is a very laid back no frills place which is great when you just want to be casual. I always order the Chicago dog with a hot link and the clam strips with wasabi ranch so awesome! This is a family owned place so you will see pretty much the same faces everytime you come in.

I've always settled for Sports Authority, since there's one close to my house, until my boyfriend insisted that we come to Dick's.

My husband and I dropped by this new cafe in the Junction at around 5 on a Friday afternoon. No line ups and the staff member was so friendly; she let us try several flavours until we made our decision. My husband is a very picky eater and is traditionally an ice cream kind of guy. We explained this to the friendly woman behind the counter and she asked him what he likes in terms of ice cream and then made several suggestions. He fell in love with the banana and chocolate flavours and I went with the mango and nocciola (hazelnut). We made the mistake of ordering medium cups not realizing how much fit into that size. We'll go with the small next time because there was so much gelato! We'll be visiting this place again soon!,0.0
"It follows that every hotel would have to have a ""worst room."" Bad luck that we had to get it. North-facing with a view of the air conditioning ductwork, and a smoking room (after we had requested non-smoking some six months earlier when we booked). In an effort to get some fresh air, we opened the window vents, to discover that we were right above the spa with its overpowering perfumes. When we registered, we were told that the hotel was so very busy and nothing  could be done. Later in the evening I saw hundreds of people continuing to come in and register. Woke every morning with a raw throat. We asked one more time for a different room, but were again rebuffed.

On a few visits I had Borscht, some different Pierogis (Varenyky?) and cabbage rolls. None of it knocked me out but all were fine.

I recommend traveling in Europe to get a real taste for these foods, which unless your friends and family are making it does not make it across the Atlantic very well.

Ordered the chicken sandwich added avocado, (thankful for that!). Bar was great. Solid bartenders good service, but the worst $17 sandwich I've ever eaten. I was in a hurry &  ate the chicken & Avo, took off the thick & way too hard panini grilled bread roll (not a good choice). The fresh green beans were delicious, I enjoyed most of those. I did ask the waitress if i should have been able to see the shiitake mushrooms & brie that were listed in the menu.  She said 'yes', they definitely forgot them. I only added avo but had not removed anything when I ordered. The waitress looked over evidence( the bun) and it was obvious there were none. She offered me a complimentary dessert, I declined. & then complimentary drink, I graciously declined as I needed to get to my gate to catch my flight.  I appreciated her effort, i hadn't complained, until it dawned on me that it wasn't a good sandwich. The service was thankfully very good, 'my' sandwich, the absolute worst $17 sandwich to date.

"My fiancé and I came here for summerlicious lunch and we ordered:

Marinated cucumber - thinly sliced cucumber marinated in vinegar and sesame. It reminded me of a Chinese cold noodle dish minus the chicken. It was nothing much to boast about.

Inari - I've had their Inari before and quite enjoyed it. It hit the spot this time and nice balanced flavours.

Jajang noodle - I know it's a fusion dish, but I much much prefer the jajang mein at a Korean restaurant. I really disliked the citrus peel flavour in this jajang noodle. Overall it wasn't that great in flavours, but the noodles were at least cooked properly.

Ginger scallion noodle - again, nicely cooked noodles and nice flavours as you get to the bottom, but a bit oily.

German chocolate jimbo cake truffle - I've had their birthday cake and strawberry truffle in the past, and didn't have high hopes for these chocolate ones, and I was right.

"I came here for Father's Day. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants and I never had any complains, but today. We came in, and ordered our food. The restaurant wasn't packed like usual. I got a cup to get water but then juice came out. My dad told the cashier who answered ""oh we don't have any more water."" wow.  We get to our table and we didn't need to wait awhile for our eel sushi which was mostly just rice. My dad received his curry  rice....Worst presentation and not appealing. My sister's order comes and the waiter's fingers were black and dirty was touching her rice and tempura. I asked him if they had new management and he said it's been a month. So that explained it. I feel bad for the owner.. I wouldn't be surprised if this restaurant closed down.  It is so obvious that the employees hate their jobs. Nobody smiled except one lady. They were rude and just looked real unhappy. I saw the cashier talking down to the Japanese cook. Anyway so they close at 8pm today and a couple comes. I asked if they were the owner and they weren't. I told them it was because if they were I wanted to tell them about our experience. So anyway after 15mins, the lady stands up and says she didn't get the right order, that her dish tasted like they put vinegar in it and that  they forgot her order and when she asked about it the cashier said it was because they came in late. She ended up asking for a refund. I am never coming back to this restaurant ever again.",0.0
They have a poor advertising promoting steak and crab legs $12.99. Be prepared to fight for it though. Ate at the Las Vegas Blvd and Warm Springs location but no employee has ever heard of it OR managers they say it's only for participating... I said its false advertising and it was honored. Sadly worst crab legs we ever had. DRY DRY DRY. Eat there all the time! Very disappointed.,0.0

"This sushi restaurant has fresh fish and is the best I've found for a reasonable price in the valley (This coming from an east coast foodie who LOVES sushi.) However, the service is bad more often than it is good and NEVER go here in a hurry. I've never made it out of there in less than an hour. Once I went in there and asked for an itemized check, it took them 25 minutes to bring the check back AND it still wasnt itemized. In fact, I still don't know what it was. I love their sushi but its about time for me to find a new sushi restaurant after how many times I've had waitresses be rude and even ignore me.

Kurzum ein nettes Restaurant mit leckeren Vorspeisen und Luft nach oben bei meiner Hauptspeise. Nette Bedienung und absolut zu empfehlen.
Bedienung
Die Bedienung war nett und aufmerksam. Die Speisen und Getränke kamen nach einer angemessenen Wartzeit.
Das Essen
Als Vorspeise gab es gegillte Pepperoni. Kann ich nur weiterempfehlen! Danach wurde mir ein Salat angereicht der nicht nur gut schmechte sondern auch noch gut aussah. Bis dahin perfekt! Danach kam die bestellte Fischplatte, die was die Auswahl anging sehr ordentlich war. Leider waren die Hälfte der enthaltenen Fische paniert, was ich sehr schade fand. Ergibt dann irgendwie direkt einen Fastfood-Charakter. Ein guter Fisch benötigt nur ein paar Gewürze - sonst nichts!

"I have always came here for Korean food since I live across the street and the food was pretty decent.

Instead I go to the Korean restaurant diagonally across from it which is very good and has consistent good portions.",0.0
"Vegan, raw, omni,  I don't discriminate as long as it's pure, natural, and done with perfection. Belmonte Raw nails it.  Their juices and vegan milks are far better than the competitors.

Not relying on sweetness to win over the palate, these juices are a vitamin shot to the heart, mind, soul. 

I am a bit overwhelmed by the prices hence a star short of a perfect rating.

I've had a burger which is very good and their club sandwich is one of the best I've ever had. While I haven't been out there myself, the patio is huge and inviting. I just wish they had draught beer- although it's my understanding that's not their fault.",0.0
"Although I would have given them three stars a couple months ago, this place has gotten really bad. Now, I try to avoid the place if I can. First of all, the management puts almost zero money into the gym. If you're into weightlifting, there are rarely any barbells free. There are around eight benches and two squat racks, but only around five bars free. I once had to wait 30 minutes to bench. Other equipment is average at best.

For another example, they used to have a full rack of medicine balls. Now, they have one. None of the staff know where they went. Washrooms are okay at best, absolutely disgusting at worst. Men will often shave their body hair in the sink and not clean up. Toilet area often smells of urine, to the point of ammonia.

"Still hunting for a new Chinese go-to since our favorite local closed. This is better then the other two we've tried in the surrounding block of Leith Walk, but it still didn't blow me away. I am a severe traditionalist and always order sweet and sour chicken to judge the place and the sauce here is a ginger explosion. It was alright, but no where near sweet and sour. The kung pow noodles were good, but again wasn't blown away. 

You can order on-line, which is nice and easy and then go pick it up, assuming they might do delivery?

Although they do have lot of options for any interest.

"Best to know what you're in for before you get here.  Located in Henderson, NV, Railroad Pass is about half way between Las Vegas and Hoover Dam.  It's a nice stop if you're making that trip.

It's a sparse, older crowed.  Not a very big casino so, depending on the day and time, you may not find the gaming you are looking for.  We go there for the $1 craps tables - typically later in the day as well as weekends.  We got on a table around 4 or 5pm on a Friday and mostly had it to ourselves - very excellent!  

While there, we needed to eat, so we tried the buffet.  Not great.  Some of the food was okay, but the steaks were below average (thin - not even sure what cut they were).  You could order the steak however you wanted (and watch them cook it), but it was pretty much random what you got.

"We found this gem purely by luck. I am crazy about seafood and Cajun food and so happy these guys do it right. The inside of the restaurant might be a little too loud and touristy for some. By loud, I don't mean noisy, but more like bold and colorful in terms of the decor. Service is fast and courteous.
For appetizers, I highly recommend the gator tail. It's listed as a ""seasonal"" item, but it really isn't seasonal, they have it at all times. They just list it as seasonal in case they don't get a supply of gator, which happened like, once in the past few years. The other really good appetizer to try is the rat toes. Unlike the gator tail, which really is the tail of an alligator, thankfully, the rat toes are not what they are called. They are jalapeños stuffed with shrimp and crab meat and then battered and deep fried. They are really good!
Their shrimp po' boy is possibly the best po' boy I've ever had. It's loaded with shrimp (see photos) and so satisfying! We have also tried their ""gumbeaux"" (good ol' gumbo), Stuffd Shrimp Great (shrimp filled stuffed with crab meat, served over rice with a rich creamy sauce) and Shrimp En Brochette (bacon and jalapeño wrapped shrimp over dirty rice). They've all been really good. These guys also have an assortment of desserts and mixed drinks, none of which we have actually tried yet, but they look good, especially the Gator Punch (description from their menu -- ""killer trashcan drink with 6b liquors in a fish bowl"") -- and it really is HUGE!
Overall a very nice, authentic Cajun place. We are totally in love with it!",0.0
"I like this place a lot but it's not as big as other Barnes & Nobles I've seen around.  Then again I've seen some even smaller than this location too.

They have a wide selection of books to choose from but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the location.  It's kind of on a weird corner so if you park and try to cross the street to get to it, it becomes a game of Frogger.  You're trying to make it from your car to the bookstore without getting hit.  I generally have to park elsewhere and walk around the outdoor mall a bit to get here.  It seems easier than parking really close to it.

Not really much you can say about a book store.   It's great, wide selection.  Bathrooms could stand to be cleaner but the staff is friendly so that counts for something.",0.0
"I'm a huge fan of their happy hours special! Of course, their food is not as fresh as you think, but if you're craving a better option than Wendys or McDonalds, then this place isn't as bad. You have to be careful as well, I got my entree plate half-way done. How could you cook chicken half-way done?

"I dig this place, mostly, because of the square pizza.  You can find it on a platter when you walk in, and its really the diamond in the rough.  It is so hearty, and filling, and crunchy, and flavorful. 

The staff reminds me of New York.  They sort of have an attitude, but you realize its not really an ""F u"" attitude, but rather they want to know what you want, and get it done.  They don't waste time beating around the bush - you ask a question, you get an answer.  Not with a smile, or a thank you - but, it feels like New York - what can I say.  They get it done.  At the end of the day, that's what I want.

When you are into your food the staff isn't in the dining room at all, so your conversations never get interrupted, and they never make you feel like you need to leave.

"For the non-Mexican food lover, you'll find their hamburgers to be adequately sufficient. It's just a Plain Jane type of burger, lettuce and tomatoes. A simple man. Yet, good and filling, it's a burger at a Mexican place. Nachos would be a second choice, but they're really just mini, greasy, delicious  tostadas. I love them! Order the Small - you're not going to be able to finish it, so don't bother ordering the Large. Oooh, almost forgot about a picky kid's choice: a giant cheese crisp! This can also be an appetizer for a large group, just add salsa zigzags all over that biznatch. 

Slightly Mexican inclinations? Their lovely,  giant chimichanga is what I set my standards to. It's delicious.

"Everest is an authentic Nepali restaurant that specializes in both traditional Nepali food and Indian food.  My wife and I have been here twice and have stuck with the Nepali dishes.

After trying both chicken momos and veggie momos, we decided that we prefer chicken momos fried ( you can also have them steamed. ) Ordering chau chau (veg or chicken) is a must on our list and we also enjoyed the thukpa.  This place is owned and staffed by Nepalis. The owner both cooks and serves tables.

The truffled egg sandwich looked like it'd be a bit heavy, but the eggs were fluffy, bacon crispy, feta creamy w\/ hints of truffle oil, & the skin of chive potatoes had a bit of a crunch that gave a good textural difference and made it a really good side. The pancakes we got were a pretty decent size with some powdered sugar on it. Surprisingly the pancakes had a bit of a crisp on the top layer and were almost cloud like w\/o that heavy butter taste.

"I wouldn't stay at Planet Hollywood again nor would I recommend anyone to stay there. From the second we arrived to the hotel, service was slow. We waited for valet and for a bellboy to come get our belongings. When I got to the front desk to check in the lady told me they didn't have anymore 2 queen size beds available but had a king size available, (yea with four girls, sure), I paid for TWO QUEENS !! The lady finally found one and, after she did they had the nerve to charge us $16 to check in early, which I've never heard of a hotel doing if they have a room available. I've stayed at 5 star hotels and NEVER been charged for an ""early check in."" 
As soon as my friends and I walked into our room it reeked of weed. We called the front desk to complain (it took about 15 minutes to even get through) and they said they couldn't give us another room, (which they could've because the lady at the first desk asked us if we wanted to upgrade) they also said they would send someone up to spray. Well, that never happened! The room smelled like weed all weekend because the room next to us was blowing it into our bathroom vent. We called again to complain Friday night that it was an issue, so the hotel comped our $16 early check in fee (something I feel we shouldn't have been charged in the first place) and sent Security up to look into it. Nevertheless, every night weed blew into our vents and smelled up our room. 
Planet Hollywood's inability to remedy the situation left a bad taste in my mouth. On top of that, the rooms are really small, almost outdated even. I've stayed in a lot of hotels in Vegas over the years, from 5 stars to 3 stars and this is by far the worst room I've stayed in. The only thing PH has going for them is Britney Spears!!

"How long does it take to soak noodle in the hot water and pour a scoop of broth over it?  If you want to wait over half hour after we ordered and had some items served, come to Jenni's Pho and Grill.

I took my print to him (he will come to you and hang your art in your home as well) and he gave me suggestions for the best look. The print came out great. The matting and frame are perfect. He was also faster and at a better price then Aaron Brothers.  I had an autographed football helmet that I wanted to put in a case as well so after seeing the results of my print, figured I would take it to GP (owner).

"I was not that impressed with Wicked Spoon.  First off, the buffet is located in an obscure corner of the building (a little bit of hike if you coming off the Strip).  The decor is nice (probably because it's one of the newer buffets).  While the presentation of the food (in the small little pans and pots) is impressive, the quality of the food is just OK.  There is a good variety but I found most of the dishes somewhat bland in flavor.  Also, prepping the food in the pots and pans has it's drawbacks.  Many of the dishes were kept warm with heat lamps and we found that that tended to dry out the top of many of the dishes.  Also, if you just wanted to have a tasting, you had to take the whole serving dish.  We felt like we wasted a lot of food.  Service, like most other LV buffets, is very good.

"I stayed over Halloween weekend this year.  It is a HUGE hotel, for sure!  I got lost several times just trying to make it from the garage to the hotel.  Staff was nice and the hotel is super interesting with a casino downstairs and music memorabilia throughout (not just rock stars but all genres).  Room was a decent size and very clean. I didn't love the mini bar system - it's weighted so if you move anything you are charged.  I made a special effort not to touch it.  I also didn't like the fact that there was no indoor pool.  There were maybe 4 or 5 outdoor pools though and they were nice.  Spas, shops and restaurants in the hotel so that was very convenient.  Food was moderately priced and just 'ok' for me.  Halloween night was fun with all types of folks coming through!  I took pix of the costumes (which ranged from very simple to EXTREMELY elaborate).  I was going to attend the Halloween party but when I realized it was $100 cover I opted out and just walked around the casino instead.  I was suffering from major sticker shock on that one and bummed that there was no discount for guests.

I ordered ahead and it was ready when I arrived about 10 mins later. When I got home about 5 mins later the burrito showed NO signs of sogginess or dripping sauces. I often get burritos that are leaking or falling apart from other places, but was really surprised to see how well it was packaged. Lots of flavour from the ingredients - the fish was SO GOOD...nice texture, fresh, perfect. Nice and warm. Packed full of beans, chow mein noodles of all things, other veggies, cheese...and so on. GO TRY IT TODAY.",0.0

"Two Words: HAPPY HOUR! I Can't believe their happy hour starts right when most places are serving dinner at 8pm. Seating fills up very fast so you must get here well before 8pm to take advantage.

"I purchased my first Benz from Rahal in April, a new 2014 ML350. Prior to going to Rahal at the recommendation of a family member, I had shopped at two other Mercedes dealerships. Rahal was by far superior not only in service, but in price as well. When buying expensive things getting a good deal doesn't always factor in but I felt the team at Rahal, from Pete my sales consultant on up, gave me a fair shake on the new car price compared to other dealers. Judging by the price they put on my trade in when they sold it on their lot, a fair trade in value as well. I get first class treatment in service from Roberto my rep, who helped me out when I had a flat with only 300 miles on the car. Apparently I ran over a nail and they put a new tire on at no charge. Unless business takes me to a place along the lines of a Bentley, I will stick with Rahal and Mercedes. Yes, a Mercedes Benz is worth it 100% as a product, but when it comes to sales and service, my experience was a first class affair as well.",0.0

"This is a review for their food and delivery service.

I ordered their stuffed pasta pizza. Everything in it was spot on. It was not greasy, which is really common when it comes to pizza and especially with stuffed pies. It's a really thick crust that had a bit of sweet to it, something that I love in pizza. It reminds me of pizza from Northern NJ and New York City, where I'm originally from.
Now as for the chicken wings. They are among the best I've had. Again, it's not greasy even with the sauce on. The wings are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had the mild sauce and it was pretty spot on, just enough kick to it. 
Metro is a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum but you see it in the quality of the food you get. The delivery fee to my area was $3, which is average compared to all other delivery places. Really good service, had extra sauces for everything included. 
I have to say that Metro is worth the extra money for the quality of food you get.",0.0

"Been reading through some of these bad comments and they are as made up as they come! Wow, liars. I've purchased 6 cars from this dealership in the last 3 years! 6 cars!! Why??

If we had any kind of a bad experience, we wouldn't have purchased even one vehicle from them.
Their sales team is super! We've always been treated with respect! We go there for repairs and oil changes. They've kindly given us the use of loaner vehicles for however long it takes to make a repair. Brand new loaner cars! Who does that for a 4 hour job? Planet Hyundai Sahara, that's who!
They have never charge us more than the sticker, usually lower. They've taken trade-ins and swapped out lease\/purchase vehicles with absolutely no problems! I can also say that whatever price or agreement we came to, they took exceptional care of me, even on our first purchase.
The warranty is amazing! We paid for one repair that wasn't covered under the warranty. One repair for six cars. I'd say that's amazing! (it was a belt)

Overly priced for bland food although the portion was a good size. The only thing good on each plate were the potatoes AND they made it fresh, I think\/hoped. Haha 

I guess it can be confusing to order. As we walked up to the hostess stand she immediately came out from the back to help us. So my cousins friend came down and joined us but she went up to the register to order her food and then sat down with us. She didn't know there was dine-in and take-out. 

I thought the little market area where I saw they had cold cuts to make your own sandwiches (in your room \/ to go) was a neat idea. Especially if you're tired of spending so much money on dining out while visiting Vegas. 

I wouldn't come back unless I really, really, really have to. I know there is good breakfast somewhere on the strip just a hop and a skip away. 

We got pancakes, chicken and waffles and an omelette. My pancakes tasted like flour straight from the packet. I couldn't even cut it with my fork. I had to slice it back and forth my butter knife which tore the thing apart. I'm no chef but I can make better pancakes at home. For the chicken and waffles, try taking plain chicken breast and crust it with plain Corn Flakes cereal. The waffle had green onions mixed in the batter. Idk that meal just didn't work!

Once we finally got seated the environment was very loud and hectic. It was hard to hear the rest if our party without yelling back and forth. The menu was very small and everything was very pricey for the quality of food they were serving. I ordered the Mac and cheese burger and expected a lot of flavor, all I got was a mediocre burger that had some flavorless macaroni on top of it. My wife ordered the street tacos and for $20 they brought out a few tiny tacos that didn't compare to a local taco shop that would give you 20 of them that were bigger, better, and full of flavor for the same price.

My boyfriend and I went for dinner on a weeknight. It was pretty busy but we managed to get a good table right away. It's much larger than the original location.

When I explained to them my schedule and asked if they could help, all they said was ""no"" there was so solution, no help... It was a simple ""no"". Or, when I called on Saturday around noon (when their hours clearly state that they are open until 6) they told me that they stop grooming at 3, and they couldn't help me.

Then once they got there they moved SO fast, I couldn't believe it! They were like a well oiled machine, and I just wish I'd realized how effective they were before because I could have done a lot less work! Especially with the drawers...turns out they can just wrap up anything with drawers and you don't even have to pack it up, so I feel very stupid for having bothered to pack all my clothes and art supplies! When we got to the new place they were very good about asking me where to put things, learned which rooms I had dedicated as which fast, and for the stuff that I didn't have a clue where I wanted it, managed to make remarkably logical decisions. Nothing was damaged, even my supremely fragile collectibles that break when you so much as look at them. The last company I used tore a great big hunk off a corner off my desk, and when they glued it back on it's all lopsided and euch! They didn't mind my two dogs at all and even asked permission before getting lunch between the two places, which I gladly gave since it was an 8 hour job and wanted lunch myself anyway!

Avoid at all costs!   This was the worst experience ever.  It took 20 minutes just to get margaritas and over an hour to get our food.  The place was practically empty so it wasn't like they were busy.  We could see two people behind the bar.  One was on the computer and the other just standing around.  When the meals came one had avacado on the tacos after having been told that I was deathly allergic to avacado.  The meal was remailed but that also took a lot of time.  The quesadilla was dry and tastless.  The burrito bowl was over salted and 1 of the 3 tacos was pretty good.  We came here at the recommendation of a friend and we were terribly disappointed.  Luckily we were visiting a long time friend so the time wasn't completely wasted.  It is also very expensive for the portion sizes.  Our poor friend was so embarrased.

For example the ketchup popcorn has the same flavour as ketchup chips but less in your face and more subtle. I tried the piña colada flavour and it was incredible.

"What I had: Mix plate = Roasted pork (w\/ gravy) (left) + Souyou Chicken (right) + 2 scoops rice + Mac + drink = $14+

The waitresses are nice and attended to me 3-4 times. The ""big one"" has a strong Hawaiian vernacular which I liked

THE GOOD: Better roasted pork then most other hawaiian places, covered with gravy loco moco style while other Hawaiian restaurants actually use hamburger patties for their loco moco. I prefer this roasted pork, reminds me of turkey and gravy and will PUT YOU TO SLEEP - I saw someone on here complaining about it being mostly fat - He must've gotten the bottom of the barrel because mine was mostly meat with only 1-2 pieces of fat - HUGE Portions - bring a toothpick ;)

The Souyou chicken is like a bowl with ACTUAL chicken breast and leg pieces in the soupy teriyaki-like thick broth. Not too sweet which is good cause teriyaki can make or break a dish... teriyaki taste was perfect, not too sweet, not too salty - This was on special because it was thursday and it was $9 by itself - but the waitress was kind enough to suggest i get the mix plate with that on it instead which was only $13 (before drink(s) - the chicken skin fat was ACTUALLY EDIBLE... unlike L&L BBQ which is veiny, super fat and makes me gag. Great food period

The mac and rice were decent but nothing to brag about

THE BAD: The ""Tropical flavor"" ice tea was disappointing because I was expecting something NICE - it was REALLY just passionfruit ice tea and it was bland and not even sweet. I had to add a couple Splenda packs to make it good

Their quesadillas are amazing though. There's a semi-thin layer of cheese and it's cooked on a flat top so it is extra crispy. And every table has a bottle of green salsa, which is not too spicy, but if you do want spicy you can just ask for it at the counter.

Es handelt sich bei diesem Selbstbedienungsbetrieb schließlich um ein ausgewiesenes XXL-Schnitzel-Restaurant  - ""Das XXL-Schnitzelparadies"": Diese Selbstbeschreibung sollte gewohnheitsmäßigen Kaviar-, Stopfleber und Trüffel-Konsumenten zu denken geben, bevor sie einen romantischen Abend buchen, oder ist die Bezeichnung missverständlich?

Ich wusste nach dem Besuch der Homepage, Fernsehbeiträgen und Hörensagen, worauf ich mich einlasse.

Tatsächlich blieb trotz unseren gesunden Appetits je ein Schnitzel übrig. Was soll's: Ab in die bereitgelegte Tüten, am nächsten Tag war ein weiteres leckeres Mittagessen gesichert.

Noch einige Worte zur vielkritisierten Parkplatzsituation: Ja, es gibt nicht viele Parkplätze am Standort Onkel Otto Waldebene Ost; ja, die Anfahrt ist indiskutabel (bei Gegenverkehr ist man verloren und muss ggf. eine nicht unerhebliche Strecke im Rückwärtsgang zurücklegen). Aber ist es tatsächlich ein so großes Problem, die paar Schritte (ca. 300 Meter) zum Restaurant zu laufen? Vor der Einfahrt zur einspurigen Zufahrt kann jeder kostenlos am Straßenrand parken.Und wer sich über zu große und fettige Portionen aufregt, der sollte doch froh sein, wenn er die Gelegenheit hat, ein paar Kalorien abzulaufen.",0.0

The pho here is mediocre.  The broth is lukewarm and will only a few slices of beef.  I really do remember it being a lot better.  I really think it's going down hill.  However I had the Vietnamese coffee here and it was pretty good.  Overall I would only come here out of convenience for others.  There are definitely better pho restaurants that you can find around town.,0.0
"My daughter had a craving for eggs Benedict and we tried this place for the first time. Ordered the Crab Benedict which was really good. Thought it would be made like the florentine, but still lots of flavor nonetheless. The service was great wish I could have remembered her name.

"Uh... what the hell yelpers.  Give this place 5 stars.  First things first.. they have an IMAX THEATRE, biggest in the south west region I might add, that alone should make it a 5 star place.  If you're being snide about service and wait time for popcorn, Go screw yourself.  these are mostly High School students with their first job ever, cut them some slack.  Secondly if you come to the movies with 5 minuets til preview starts and expect to get your popcorn and drinks lightening quick you are mistaken, thats not how things work in the world you should all know that by now.  

I  chose Harkins over any other theatre because they actually do a lot of good charity work in the world, and actually want to SAVE YOU MONEY!!!  Unlike AMC where you can pay 15 dollars a year to get $0.25 saving each time you buy a bigger drink or popcorn... 

Harkins allows you to buy a loyalty cup and you can get refils anytime for $1.50 (okay I'm a tad bit upset they jacked the price up 50 cents, but not enough to give it a bad review) AND... you can buy a Loyalty shirt every year which gets you FREE popcorn when you go to a movie.  PEOPLE, seriously buy the loyalty shirt.  If you go to AT LEASTTTTT 4 times a year, you get your money back from free popcorn.  I go like every week so this shirt has paid for itself in a month.  Oh and they allow student, senior, and military discount... Seriously how can people complain or give this a bad ranking...  It shouldn't be ""news"" to people anymore that  candy, drinks, popcorn etc.. prices have gone UP!  If you can go without candy you can see a Regular movie for $8.50 which includes a drink and popcorn.  Show me any other movie theater that can get you this deal EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU GO.

I have this place wired down and come here regularly.  If you are a solo movie goer like myself, I tend to go very late in the evenings or earlier in the afternoons.  I also usually go on the weekdays.  This allows me to a practically empty theater, with no wait times for popcorn or drinks.  Obviously the best way to watch a movie is with a small group of friends, date, or by yourself.  If you go on an opening weekend or anytime on the weekend for that matter, Arizona Mills can be a dirty gross place.  But this theatre is absolutely amazing if you can get the place to yourself.

"This is my new favorite place to have a salad in Boulder City. Have been coming here to eat periodically for many years but sort of stopped because the veggies were always soggy and lifeless. Then a few weeks ago a friend suggested we stop in for an early dinner and I must say the veggies were cooked perfectly. So I've been back twice since then and am loving the Greek salad with grilled salmon with cilantro pesto. It's a perfect sized portion and just deliciously seasoned salmon. The salad is excellent with a generous dressing and feta cheese.

"My car tire was leaking air at a significant rate. If I made it home from work, my tire undoubtedly would be flat by morning. I made it to the Bridgeville store last evening and, without an appointment, the team at PepBoys was able to get me in quickly.

Based on the position I was in I was preparing myself for a sales pitch--you need a new tire. What I received instead was a visual inspection of the nails that had punctured my tire and an offer to patch the tire. I accepted the offer.

After the work was complete, the associate explained that if i joined the Rewards program I can get a free puncture repair.

As for the sides we ordered, a vegetable medley and  the creamed spinach. The vegetables were OK, nothing too exciting and the creamed spinach was VERY rich, and I felt it had a little too much cheese. I honestly don't think I would order it again.

The restaurant is very tiny, hole in the wall type place. Posters of El Salvador on the walls..making me want to travel there! Our server was nice, did not speak much English, but that was not really a problem.

The food was yummy! I got the squash and cheese and the bean and cheese pupusa and they were both awesome.

"In one word, horrible! We stayed here thinking we were getting a nice place on the strip, boy were we wrong!! The place was so run down and falling apart. The rooms were dirty and cheaply made. The shower rod fell off, there was no remote for the tv so the tv was no use, and the rug was stained and filthy it made our feet black. Outside the rooms the carpet was held together with duct tape, the wallpaper was peeling off, there were pipes and wiring hanging from the ceiling, and there was no access to stairs, which is a huge fire hazard!!!! The elevators were not all working so we had to wait in line to get to and from our room. Sometimes it took us 10 or so minutes just to go two floors. Plus, the pool was under reconstruction so we had no access to their pool. When it was time to check out, the lady informed us that we had charges on our card. We told her we should not have because we had their promotion of $15 a day for food and drinks. We never went over the $15 a day. She then told us that tips don't count towards the $15. This was never explained to us!!!! She should have kindly removed those charges and apologized for the inconvenience, but instead she gave us attitude and made it seem like our fault.

"I love this place. I am a massage therapist so I am always trying to find foods to eats between clients that wont make me tired after eating and keep me feeling full the rest of my shift. Its embarrassing to have a grumbling tummy while with a client. Gabbagreen has this. 
 
1. The food is healthy, energizing, and keeps me feeling full with out feeling like I over ate.

2. The portions they provide are just right and on some of the reviews I read people complained about the taste, well I got a sample of the dressings before I pick one so that way I pick one I knew I liked. 

3. The price is a little high but if you really think about it Gabbagreen is using fresh greens\/fruits and even in the store those are not cheap... If you use cheap materials you will get cheap products... I just hope their fruits and veggies are from farmers markets\/local farmers and not from a Walmart produce section.

My go-to entrees have always been the enchilada dinner or the chile relleno plate. Both come with a side of rice and beans and a homemade tortilla.

"This restaurant is my new favorite breakfast place. The food was perfectly prepared and interesting. The breakfast burro with roasted potatoes was delicious and they serve the best iced chai I've ever had. It was so good I bought one to go. The place was packed but the service was still great. We were given granola and sweet potato chips to snack on and a dish with peppers and a complimentary dessert. All of these dishes were fun and the presentation was great. The chef even came out to chat for a few minutes and see how we liked our meal.

"I liked the location area and general ambience of the restaurant. The restaurant is like the neighborhood, a mash-up of different generations, cultures and genres.  The prices online are cheaper than the actual prices in-store, which was slightly frustrating.  

My girlfriend was planning on ordering Shrimp & Grits, online it was $12.39, but in store on the menu it was $15.99.  She ended up ordering the Special Flounder & Grits, which she was not happy with.  The grits were plain and unseasoned.  The flounder was fried and fine, but nothing spectacular and also came with an order of black beans.. again nothing spectacular.  Our daughter ordered a hamburger, which was also unseasoned and plain.. nothing spectacular for the price.  I ordered the veggie plate, which I liked because they tasted exactly how I would prepare them myself.  Got the collard greens, sweet potato mash, and mac & cheese.  Initially, I ordered the cauliflower, but did not like it at all and traded it for the mac & cheese.  Also, got a deviled egg which was good and a biscuit, which somebody in my family ate.. so it must have been pretty good.  

Prices were kind of high considering portion sizes, but I do like how the ingredients are locally sourced and most of the menu is vegetarian friendly.. the vegetables are prepared vegan, instead of with ham hock or smoked turkey.  I would possibly go back..",0.0

"I purchased a Groupon for a mini facial, and the services I ended up receiving was well over what I had expected. Initially I was very apprehensive as i could't get in touch with her to book an appointment and have had similar bad experiences through groupon before. I did eventually get my appointment, and when I arrived she was very welcoming and takes the time to understand your skin type and problem areas so she can craft the facial accordingly. The facial took a little over an hour and included extractions, light therapy and microdermabrasion as i was suffering from dark spots and acne. My appointment was about 3 weeks ago so I've waited to write this review until i could see what the actual results were. My skin has cleared up almost completely and there is a visible difference with my dark spots. She gave me a few tips to try with my diet that would help with the acne recurring along with the treatment. I will probably be booking another appointment soon and hopefully will have a similar pleasant experience. 

ps. This happened while i was there, and although It didn't affect me it's worth mentioning. During my appointment another customer who seemed to be a regular arrived and martina had to send her away because they had a scheduling mixup.

"We recently discovered that our pool was losing an excessive amount of water.  In fact, the amount was troubling and we feared the worst.   After contacting a couple of leak detection companies who were listed on this site and not receiving any assistance what-so-ever, we contacted an award wining high-end custom home builder for a possible lead.  They immediately gave us John's number at Underwater Operations who we contacted that evening.  After speaking with John regarding the details of the leak he said he would be out first thing tomorrow morning.  He arrived earlier than expected to our home (called ahead to let us know he was ahead of schedule) and had a great demeanor right from the start.  We showed him the pool and described what had been done to that point at which time he gave us the ""plan of attack.""  After retreiving his tank and gear from his truck and returning pool side, I asked him what we were looking at in terms of cost for finding the leak?  He said there would not be a charge unless he found the leak and was able to fix it. Before I could get another word out he submerged with dye in had in search or the leak.  After about twenty-five minutes underwater he resurfaced with a perplexed look on his face and said ""Do you have a pool maintenance company?""  I responded ""We did but we just let them go as the pool was not getting cleaned, filters were not being serviced and overall performance was poor. Why?""  What he said next surprised me.  ""I found the leak and it looks like VANDALISM!""  Suffice it to say I had to see this with my own eyes so I changed into my trunks, grabbed my mask and dove in meeting him at the bottom of the pool where he directed me to the leak and then demonstrated the dye  test and I watched the dye disappear into a hole in the leaf basket\/strainer at the bottom of the pool.  I was shocked!  When we both resurfaced he explained the rarity of the leak and the reason for the diagnosis of vandalism.  It made perfect sense and given that the leak started shortly after we dismissed our pool maintenance company it seemed that much more reasonable... In any case, John said he had the materials to perform the repair underwater and that following the snapping of a couple of pictures and a short video (which he provided with the invoice) he would have us leak free in thirty minutes or so.  WOW!  I was impressed.  Following his repairs, we shut off all of the pool equipment and checked the water level making a note of its location, checked again twenty-four hours later and it was holding!  I called John to inform him of my findings, thanked him profusely for his service and demeanor and said I would definitely be referring him to family and friends...  John, your the best!",0.0

Cons: although they said they'd call when the bike was done, they didn't. When the brand new crank I had bought started to get large chips falling off it after less than a week, and the noise from the bottom bracket kept persisting, they were a bit slow to fix it. 

Pros: offered future discount for the inconvenience of what I'd gone through.

The wings are saucy and taste the best in this area. Other wing places around really do not compare. The service is quick and efficient.  The place is small enough to always look busy but it is a great place to come for shots, pints, sports, and wings.  What more can you really ask for in a wing joint?",0.0
This is one of the best NY style deli's I have been to! The sandwiches are ginormous and delicious. They definitely don't skimp on the meat! I would recommend this place even to the pickiest New Yorkers. They also have a breakfast that is bomb dot com!,0.0
"We came in at about 6:30 pm tonight (Sunday). Party of 15 without reservations. The hostess setup tables and sat us in about 3 minutes. Our server (Lauren) was a rock star. Food came fast, drinks stayed full, she pre-bussed and boxed food to keep the table orderly. Mussels were good, onion rings were amazing. Hot beef was good, Diamond Burger was good, Mac n cheese was good. I highly recommend based on this experience!",0.0
This place is always on point. They rotate the menu so its always seasonal and fresh. I've honestly never had a dish there that I didn't like. If you're there soon you have to try the pumpkin espresso bread pudding. I can't get enough. Its also super cute inside and the staff is so friendly and knowledgable.,0.0
"Difiore's ice-cream is so good! It's located right by the Duquesne incline and the overlooks. It's nice to grab some icecream and head over to the overlook. The icecream and the frozen yogurt is really tasty! They also make really good food as well as icecream and frozen yogurt. It's a cute little family owned shop. Parking can be a little difficult right infront of the shop, but you can always find a spot down a little more.",0.0
"Excellent French toast, server Veronica was quick and attentive. Works potatoes are great as well.",0.0
"This place is in a mall so it's hard to park and go upstairs but the food was fine
We ordered the candy crush roll which was way too sweet but the Toro roll was just excellent and the fried rice could have used some more stuff in it.. only some chunks of beef and that was it.",0.0
"Very friendly staff. Amazing selection of food, definitely recommend trying the mac n cheese.  Best part is the dog patio available.",0.0
"This place is the real deal. Best oysters in AZ, hands down! Seafood is fresh and flavorful. Atmosphere is perfect for location. I would recommend Cuttlefish to anyone; anywhere; from a business dinner to a first date, or just a night out with friends. Francesca is a great Hostess. AJ is a great bartender. Ask for Gino or Heather, they rock!",0.0
Has to be the biggest electronic TV computer store in town if it is not here you're not going to find it anywhere in town great selection almost to the point where there's too much stuff . At times a store can be kind of junky but has everything a Geek would need price is always a big thing here where you get the best deals in town and the selection is tops. I think I have purchased everything in my house here from televisions camera accessories memory for computers jump drives DVDs Blu rays tripods . Always look for the Friday ads and the mid week Wednesday ads. The checkout line is a little weird and can be long . Overall we will always come back here because of the selection and prices.,0.0
"On two separate occasions my husband and I brought our kids here for some happy meals and play time and there was some kind of spit or snot in my drink the first time and some kind of spit or snot in two of my three kids drinks the second time.

I ALWAYS look before any of us drink from any fast food and thank goodness I do!!

I will never take my kids there again and I don't advise anyone go to that location.

"Best macaroons in Vegas!  Fresh, not dry and just right size.",0.0
"This is my go to spot every time me and my friends go to Vegas. The atmosphere is great and the food is delicious! Even though the majority of us get the same thing every time we come, which is the LOBSTER ROLLS! Best lobster roll I've ever had, they aren't stingy with the amount of lobster and the rolls they use are to die for. Warm buttery goodness. I would definitely recommend people to come here and be the judge for themselves and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.",0.0
"A good experience in all respects. Polite and attentive service, good food, clean bathrooms. We had lentil soup, garlic naan, lamb goa and chicken and lamb curries.

"Wir waren am 14.02.2014 im On Top.
Wir freuten uns auf einen netten Abend in Stuttgart, denn bei Flädlessuppe, paniertem Schnitzel mit Pommes und Ofenschlupfer mit Vanilleeis und Sahne kann man nicht viel falsch machen - dachten wir.
Das Ambiente ist gewöhnungsbedüftig. Es sieht tatsächlich aus wie in einem Biergarten mit Waschbetonplatten auf dem Boden und Gartenmöbeln.
An dem Platz an dem wir saßen zog es so sehr, dass ich den ganzen Abend über die Jacke anbehalten habe. Dafür hatte ich einen prima Blick auf den Abstellraum mit Toilettenpapier und diversem anderem Kram.
Die Flädlesuppe schmeckte nach Tütensuppe und kam nach 25 Minuten in 2 Etappen. Während die Einen bereits fertig waren mit essen warteten Andere an unserem Tisch noch.
Das Gleiche beim Hauptgang. Der kam nach ca. 80 Minuten. Auch hier wurde in Etappen gegessen. Wenn ich jetzt schreiben würde, dass das Schnitzel mit Pommes nach Imbissbude geschmeckt hat, würde ich wohl jeden Imbissbesitzer beleidigen. Fakt ist: Nach meiner Erfahrung bekommt das jeder Imbissbudenbesitzer besser hin. Das Schnitzel und die Pommes waren vollgesogen mit Fett und schmeckten alt, trocken und hatten einen fischigen Nachgeschmack.
Eine Überraschung war der Ofenschlupfer, denn der war sogar leidlich gut, wenn er auch ohne Sahne und ohne Vanilleeis serviert wurde.
Die Bedienung war sehr nett und bemüht, der Ausblick auf Stuttgart toll.
Unser Endresümee ist:
Schade um die Zeit, die wir mit herfahren und auf`s Essen warten vergeudet haben.
Schade um das Geld das wir ausgegeben haben.
Schade, denn wir werden das Lokal weder weiterempfehlen, noch jemals wieder dorthin gehen.",0.0
"Excellent greasy spoon, I can see why this place has so many faithful regulars. The service is as outstanding as the food, cooked exactly how you want it just like food cooked at home would be. Every time I go I feel so welcomed, it's like visiting my grandparent's for breakfast.",0.0
Service was awesome but my food was not very good this time around... I was excited because I ate at another Vegas location and it was awesome but this time around was just ok..,0.0
"I have to say, these fish tacos are mighty good.  

I was reading an article in Charlotte's edition of Creative Loafing and the writer mentioned ordering two specific tacos which he found to be delightful. Having lived most of my life near the coast, I have a rule about eating seafood so far inland. Yet, I've heard nothing but good things about this restaurant and I was literally a block away..so how could I resist?

I ordered a BBQ Mahi taco, which I'm told was featured on 'Diner's, Drive In and Dives.'  The fish wasn't as fresh as it would be at a beachfront taco stand and the sauce was a tad sweet for me, but that was nothing a little hot sauce couldn't fix. 

I also ordered a Tavaroo Tuna taco, which had a hint of wasabi and was fantastic. 

It was early Saturday night and the dining room was filling up quickly, so I sat at the bar and could observe everything coming out of the kitchen..and it all looked delectable.  

Nice margarita menu and beer selection too.",0.0
"Service: 
Excellent and efficient. We arrived at lunch time and were seated right away, even with a full restaurant! Our waitress brought our drinks and took our order within a few minutes. Great service!

Food: 
Delicious! I had the garden omelette (must try!) and one of their famous pancakes (also great, even if I'm not a pancake lover). 

Price: 
Reasonable. 

Ambiance: 
Family, cozy, homey.",0.0
