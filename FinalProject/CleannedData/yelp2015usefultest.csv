From their crazy enthusiasm to the great different customizable coffee there is nothing I don't like about this place. They always have a smile on their faces and spark up a conversation every single time! Minimal wait time while the line is long.,1.0
"Awful. Completely awful. Bought tickets to see CALVIN Harris here and drove out from SoCal to see him. 
So awful. Paid for tickets and couldn't even walk in there. So overcrowded. Security didn't do anything. So many people in there that couldn't handle their alcohol and were sloppy and kept bumping into people and hitting us and trying to start something. Left before we even got to see Calvin. That was my first and last time at Omnia. Love hakassan too but don't know if we will be going back at all to these clubs.",1.0
"One night after leaving Fat Tuesday, my friend and I decided to grab some quick food. Because I go to Pampas a lot, I always walk pass this place. We didn't really want to spend a lot of time eating nor did we want a lot of food.

We stopped in because I remember seeing an ad for a cheap cheeseburger. We didn't really want a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender lady was high or something. She didn't pay attention to us and she was frowning the whole time with her hood on her head.

We mentioned the cheeseburger ad and she said that it's 6.99 and that we could add bacon for no additional charge, so we did. I asked her what else came on the burger and she acted like it was a trick question or something. She told us that it came with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, and onion all on the side. Then she walked away.

The bartender brought the burgers out, after about 12 minutes. She dropped them and left. The burgers had bacon, lettuce and onions on it. Nothing was on the side.

We had to get up three times are ask for condiments because the bartender was no where to be found. By the time we got the condiments, the fries were lukewarm, which pissed me off. Well actually the fries was a surprise to me. I didn't know the burger came with fries. Either way, they were cold by the time I got to eat them.

The burger was dry, even with the mayo. The bacon was undercooked and the fries didn't have a lot of seasoning. Even though the fries were not hot, it still tasted better than the burger. The burger tasted like a boot.

We will not go back!",1.0
"2 years later, I am forced to go here to get some work done on my car. First the lady tells me it is $190 for diagnostics, I'm like seriously, I have to pay for you not to know what is wrong with my car? But in the grand scheme of things $190 might not be that much. 

Fast forward to 3 days later, she calls me back, they still have no idea what is wrong with my car and now she tells me my total is $700 (or something... I don't remember the exact amount)

I'm like-- for what?!? 
Her-Diagnostics. 
I'm like-you said that was $190... 
Her-I am actually giving you a discount because we still don't know what is wrong
Me- Seriously, do you understand how stupid that sounds...
Her- Diagnostics are $190 an hour

At this point I freak and pull out my notepad that I wrote everything down on, I read it back to her ""We are going to hook the car up to the computer to understand the error codes and run diagnostics, they are $190""

Her-Yeah see they are $190
Me- So how the hell are you charging me $700 instead of $190, I want to talk to the manager
Her- I am the manager
Me- (I should have said, well you can't do math) Ok, so how is it $700 for something that costs $190
Her- It's $190 an hour
Me- I never agreed to that, I want my car back NOW!
Her- You still owe $700
Me- So, I have to give you $700 to not do a single effing thing that was productive or successful to my car?

Ok, so here I flipped out. There may have been swearing, etc. This is just ridiculous. Poor business practices!

"All of the yes. Everything I put in my mouth from them was magical. The miso soup was hot and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was crisp and the sauce they sent with it was complex and multifaceted.

We purchased a brand new Van in October, 7 months ago. The Van had all the features that we wanted. All of a sudden after 7 months the Navigation stopped working. We called in to make an appointment and have it fixed. Now they tell me I don't have navigation and I need to talk to the salesperson, WTH why would the management tell me to talk to the salesperson? Then they go ahead and say for another $595 they can update the navigation. Be careful they lie and do what ever to get the sale then they don't care about customer service.

"Love love love this German Beer House meets Texas Grill joint! From the outside it looks small but they also have an outdoor patio that caters to groups and parties. They also have ping pong, corn hole, and giant Jenga, which is a nice touch.

My boyfriend and I went there for happy hour which had certain apps for $2 off and pints for $2 off. I appreciate that they had some beers on Nitros which gives you the smooth taste of the beer without the carbonated effect. I got the Four Peaks Brewing Co. Oatmeal Stout, which was my bf's favorite of the 4-beer flight he got too. 

For food, we got pretzels with cheese dip ($4 during HH), Sriracha butter wings ($5), and shared an order of small Belgian fries with truffle aioli and Moroccan lamb brat with apricot chutney. Everything was delicious, loved that nothing was oily or too salty. The aioli that came with the fries had just the right amount of truffle flavor. The brat was probably the best brat we've ever had and paired nicely with the apricot chutney.

They were definitely busy as it was a Friday afternoon when we went and they were catering to a large wedding rehearsal party, yet they still had the ability to be attentive to us :)

"5 stars for taste. 5 stars for flavor. 5 stars for service. 5 stars for not being a traditional over priced bullshiz restaurant that most people pretend to enjoy in order to justify the check. Shoutout to our server Gina. Thanks for being awesome. 

It's so strange because I never give out 5 stars unless the business blows my Popsicle stand over. Tonight was somewhere near exquisite and legendary. My girlfriend and I spend a lot of time eating at various restaurants and we try the best we can to enjoy ourselves based on the chefs recommendations. Of course we check our fellow Yelpers, but we always try to be as objective as possible when exploring new territories. It has become a constant struggle with expensive restaurants to really see the value in what we are tasting. With that said Bouchon was truly a great experience. The price point was medium compared to a Mastros, or Nobu, but the quality was fantastic. I couldn't believe the goodness. We got a ton of food for a great price. 

House bread - crispy on the outside with a nice gooey inside. We had 2...

House Toasted Pistachios - See description.. 

Oysters - So good that we had to order another half dozen! We tried super hard to differentiate each of the three little homies, but they were all so so so good, so it didn't matter haha. They were on point. 

Charcuterie - Came with Coppa, Prosciutto, Salami, and Pate. Holy God. The Pate was our favorite and went perfect with the house bread. I could have eaten a pound of it. 

Flat Iron Steak Frites - Served medium is the way to go. This piece of meat was sexual and for a flat iron it was pornographic. The night before I had a dry aged ribeye and this rivaled it. I can't believe how tender and juicy it was. Fries were perf. 

Mussels - The entree portion came with about 90 mussels, no shiz and we opted for the mushrooms in lieu of the frites because of the streak frites dish. Man, this could have fed an army and super good too. 

Bouchon Dessert Special - 3 chocolate bouchons with melted chocolate chips inside topped with a pretzel ice cream. Wow! It also had an amazing browned marshmallow like cream with a delightful warmed bubble of salted caramel core. My mind was blown.",1.0
"Nice place. But that's it. If you want to try Brazilian food this is not the place.
They tried, but aside from some of the staff nothing was Brazilian at all. The meat was ""slowly"" coming toward us and it got cold all the time. With my complaint the ""capitāo"" that is the nickname of the Chef he then made sure that the meat got to us warmer. The only kind of meat I wanted came just 1 time. Picanha. The only piece of meat that I can say was good was caw ribs. The pork was coming with a weird sauce. Rice ok, beans cold and without any juice. The yuca was undercooked and oily. Salad bar was poor. Again was ok if you don't know the real taste. I hope they can improve. Send the chef to Brazil for a 5 day training camp. Good luck",1.0
"Ok, the prices on the happy hour menu is kind of high to be happy about but the food is pretty solid.

The sliders are a bit weak - 2 per order, comes on a plate with some horseradish and aujus and fries.  The sliders themselves are actually small bits of sirloin meat.  With the sauce it was actually quite tasty.  The waiter kinda spilled au jus into the horseradish while delivering the plate which kinda made it look unappetizing but I'm glad we pushed through.  :P

The green chili pork is very good.  I like the hint of spice and large chunks of pork.  It comes with a couple of grilled tortillas.  

We also tried the chicken flatbread which was a bit more oily than I thought it would be but the pesto flavor really comes through and the chicken bits on top were plenty.  

The big ass burger was also delicious, however, a bit dry.  At $11 it really should be juicier.. afterall there are many ten dollar burger places one can go to in that area.

All in all, it's a decent spot for happy hours with friends.  The drinks are a bit weak and they charge $5 each.  There probably are some better spots but I would recommend trying at least sporadically.",1.0
"This shop is located in Planet Hollywood right by the entrance to the Mile Shops. You place your order at the first counter. Then you move down to the cashier where you get any additional items (chips, muffins, cookies, boxed salads, etc) and pay. Fountain drinks, coffee, and lemonade are self-serve. There are several tables and bar seating which are typically full since it's a busy location. No outdoor seating since it's in the middle of the casino. Open 24hrs. Breakfast sandwiches before 11AM. Fairly quick service so double check your order because sometimes the order is incorrect.

Our Order:
Holiday Turkey: ($6.99) Turkey, cornbread stuffing, turkey gravy, cranberry sauce & mayonnaise
Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Chips: $1.29
Earl Grey Lemonade: $2.99

BF's 1st time here (and almost the same for me since the last time I had it, I was a little kid & all I remembered was that I didn't care for it to much at the time). Both the BF and I ordered the Holiday Turkey Sandwich. Their own artisan bread was toasted just right and wasn't too dense or dry. The stuffing was flavorful and the kind that's more on the wet side than the dry stuffing that I'm used to. Not too much gravy to make the sandwich soggy (if eaten right away). The cranberry sauce was on the sweet side instead of the tart (which I prefer). The turkey are deli slices so they weren't dry but I would've preferred if they were thicker slices. Overall a good sandwich. Their salt & vinegar kettle chips went well with the sandwiches so I recommend getting a bag. The Earl Grey Lemonade was interesting but didn't have as much early grey flavor as I would've liked. BF didn't like the lemonade even though his tea of choice is Earl Grey.

The Montague and the Original are the popular sandwiches so may try that next time if I'm nearby since they are open 24 hrs.",1.0

"This is a great place to hang out, have a couple beers, and enjoy some yummy food. We come here a lot just to drink on the weekends, or for brunch on Sundays, but this time we stopped in for lunch after some shopping at West Side Market. It was a beautiful day, so we sat out on their patio. Jack Johnson music played in the background as we sipped our beers, perfectly shaded by a little tree growing between the tables. I got the Old School American Lager, which was light and refreshing. 

To eat, I had the eggplant sandwich and my boyfriend got the tofu cheesesteak. The eggplant sandwich was awesome, but messy. The whipped feta on the sandwich was delectable, and the eggplant was perfectly grilled.  I also got a salad instead of fries, and the salad was very good, much better than my boyfriend's fries. The tofu cheesesteak sandwich was also pretty good but my boyfriend did comment that he wished the tofu was crispier.

"This place is a dive bar but kinda cute during Christmas!! My husband and I were there with a large group about 40 of us. Went there on a Monday afternoon around 3pm! The place is really cool especially with all the Christmas decorations! I really wanted to like his place but service always plays a huge huge role in my reviews! The bartender was extremely rude and the security guy was even worse! Every time one of us went up to order a drink he acted as if we were bothering him??!! The security had the nerve to say to a very large group of customers on a Monday mid afternoon ""You guys need to move the fuck outta the way!"" I was in such shock when I heard that!! Seriously on a Monday afternoon when you normally would be dead the two of you are treating your paying guests like that!!  I WILL NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN!!

"Although not the worst thing imaginable, it is definitely not authentic by any stretch of the imagination. After years of living in southern California and having true Mexican food with neighbors and friends that had barely been in country for less than 6 months, this food left a ton to be desired. The chips and salsa left a good bit to be desired... the chips being paper thin and tasting like the aforementioned paper, and the salsa tasting like something from a glass jar, not a good start. Ordered their equivalent of Fajitas and I asked for extra onions, just to be told that in order to get onions, I'd have to pay an extra $5 for a skewer of peppers and onions... I simply wanted onions and was told that wasn't an option without paying that much extra. Give me an onion and I'll give you a dollar, I'll cut the thing myself. Jeez

The food shows up after about 10 minutes or so and it isn't anything remotely close to Mexican food. Carne Asada... no, it isn't. It's simply steak with salt and pepper. No flavor to it outside of the meat itself, which was a bit too fatty on top of it. The chicken, dry as can be, though the flavoring on the outside wasn't terrible, but by no means did it taste like Mexican style chicken in any fashion. Pork, terrible... dry and boring. Entirely too bland to be anything worthwhile. Moving on to the sour cream and guac that came with it, nothing special to the guac, simple avocado flavor with nothing else, sour cream was just fine. Refried beans weren't anything special, they came from a can, that much was obvious as it's the same flavor I've gotten from the cheap refried beans in the supermarket. Rice was okay at best, but nothing that made it stand out.

The food added insult to injury... All of that was after waiting an hour to get a seat. In this time, we had watched at least 6 groups that came after us get seated before we did. Their hand written list of names was proof of that as the black sharpie they used to cross out names had lines all over the paper with uncrossed lines that hadn't been seated. They favored larger parties on top of everything else. Watching a family of six get brought to their table a mere 10 minutes after arriving, and yet we'd been there for a half hour at that point, that was just a sign of things to come.

No reason for 2 stars except that they served food that you could digest, or at least something resembling it.",1.0
"We have been looking to get a new roof for about a year now, we had several quotes.  Local contractors and a couple of bigger businesses like Weather Seal.  The quotes varied like crazy!  Weather Seal came right in the middle and had a much better guarantee than the others, as well as offering financing. 

Our sales rep was nice, spent a lot of time with us and answered all of our questions without making us feel rushed or pressured.  After signing, we were informed someone would call us to get it scheduled and the work would be done within 4-8 weeks.

A month went by and we didn't hear anything, which worked out well for us because we wanted to pay a few things off before having to start paying on this.  Another week or two went by and I realized they had never called to schedule.  I was only worried about this because we had a vacation planned and wanted to be home for the install.  When they did call, it was to let us know that they would begin work in 3 days and that the dumpster would be dropped off the day prior.  

The dumpster did deliver, however they dropped it at the back of our house outside of our fence and probably the farthest possible distance from the house that it could be.  Granted, we don't have a drive in the front and it didn't personally affect us... I felt bad for the guys working.  They had to haul all the old shingles back there through our yard by hand.  We ended up borrowing a wheel barrow from friends to help them out.  In addition, they didn't even know it was there since it was out of their sight - they wasted a lot of time ""waiting"" when they could have been cleaning up.  

Weather Seal had also told us that the shingles would be dropped off the day prior which didn't happen - the truck ended up dropping off around 1pm.  Again, more wasted time for the poor roof crew.  They did the best they could but still didn't finish in one day due to it getting dark... they had to drive all the way back (I think they said 3 hours) to spend an our or two finishing up the next day.  If they would have known where the dumpster was and the shingles been delivered on time, it would have been an easy 1 day job. No personal problem for me, just felt bad for the guys because they were really great!

I couldn't believe how great of a job they did cleaning up when they were done.  We didn't find any nails or anything.  The roof looked great.  Now onto the gutters.  These were different subcontractors that came out, I believe two days after the roof was installed.  We didn't know when they were coming, they just showed up and luckily we were on our lunch break and were home.  They needed power to run their equipment which they would have no access to if we weren't there.  

The gutters look good however, the did a HORRIBLE job cleaning or maybe I should say they did an AWESOME job NOT cleaning.  Our dog came in with a nail in his fur and we found 7 nails on the ground where they removed the old gutters.  Our air conditioner, grill and window sills were covered in all the grime and debris from the old gutters.  They didn't even make an effort to make it look presentable like the roofers did. 

A day or two later, they called to schedule someone to come out so we could sign the final paperwork.  We couldn't get a time figured out on the phone as my husband and I both had to be there so she said she'd call back.  Less than 48 hours later, she called to let me know that the guy would be over in about 2 hours to get all the paperwork signed.  What?!  We had to leave work to go home and meet this guy on short notice.  He did show up on time though.  When we expressed our concerns about the wasted time, bad communication and showed him pictures of the mess left behind he was very nonchalant about it.  Basically that it happens.  I get that, but clean it up.  He said he would go out there and clean it up himself IF we wanted him to, not really offering it up you know.  It's not a cheap thing that we had done, that's why it matters that we aren't out there cleaning up afterward.  We're going to be making payments on this for years to come. 

The way the company was portrayed to me, at least the impression I got when we met with our salesman, was that everyone that came out to work on the project was their direct employee.  Turns out that a lot of subcontractors were used and perhaps that's why the communcation was so bad between Weather Seal and us and Weather Seal and the subcontractors.  Overall, the end result of the work I am happy with it all looks great.  I haven't had it long enough to speak to how it holds up during heavy rain or any issues regarding their warranty.

Would I recommend them to someone?  No, probably not at this time.
Would I use them again?  Maybe.  I think if they got things straightened out regarding communcation and cleanliness I could give them another chance to prove themselves to me.  I would prefer to talk directly to a Weather Seal employee rather than subcontractors as well.",1.0
"Premier Physicians Weight Loss and Wellness has changed my life and Dr. Dana Trippi and her excellent staff have been instrumental in helping me overcome my life-long obesity battle and for the first time since I was 15 years old (I am now 38). I am finally at a healthy weight for my body type and height (132 lbs) and have maintained this weight, along with an average BMI (22%) for almost 3 years! When I was 28 years old, I was at my heaviest, weighing 236 lbs. With the help of doctors, trainers, weight watchers, family and friends I got my weight down to around 190 and struggled throughout my 30s to keep it there. 

At the age of 36, after hiring yet another trainer and having worked out rigorously (cardio and weights for 5 hours a week) plus following weight watchers faithfully (for 4 months straight) I found that I only had lost 4 lbs and was still in the high 180s. I was about to give up and thought that I was destined to be obese for the rest of my life. 

It was the day after Christmas and I was depressed. My husband, having being laid off from his job in Las Vegas, had to take a job in Washington DC, and could only be home for 2 days! I dropped him off at the airport and went home to an empty house and sat on the couch. I felt helpless. I was fat. I was alone and sad. The thought of going to the gym 5 days a week and logging every bite I ate into my weight watchers app. with little-to-no-results was emotionally devastating. Desperate, I Goggled Weight Loss Doctors in Las Vegas, and found a Living Social Deal for Premier Physicians and read all about Dr. Trippi! I was skeptical than anyone could help me but hopeful for the first time in years. 

Dr. Trippi and staff were and are excellent. Dr. Trippi spent a lot of time talking to me about my history with obesity and addiction to food. We discussed how many times I tried to lose weight and how. She wanted to see my Weight Watchers Records--all of them. I had 4 months of very precise documentation (I'm a scientist and I didn't fib--I logged every bite I ate and every amount I exercised). She ran tests on me to determine the state of my health. We came up with a plan that was suitable for me. I learned that my body doesn't process sugar well. It likes protein, especially in the morning. Starting out with a piece of toast or cereal puts me at a disadvantage. Wine and juice are not my friends! For over a year, we adjusted the amount of calories I had, the percentage of fats, sugars, and proteins--it was a mixture of that and many talks with Dr. Trippi. 

When you are overweight, and start losing weight, you often become afraid to eat at all, for fear that you will gain a pound back. Vacations or parties stress you out because you have to change your eating habits. All of these issues may seem bizarre if someone who hasn't been obese reads this post, but to someone who has been and who has started to lose weight or who has lost a large amount of weight, you know what I mean. Dr. Trippi helped guide me through the maze of fear and confusion in terms of weight loss but also guided me to wellness--how to keep this healthy body and make this a LIFESTYLE. I have learned that my weight issue is something that I will have to manage my entire life. I understand that nothing in life is easy and I believe if I want something badly enough it's worth working for. I was fortunate to have found this place and given the tools to lose weight and to keep it off! More importantly, I was given my life back--a healthy life. 

I feel physically and mentally healthier now than I ever have. And I truly owe this place my undying gratitude. I have never written a review like this and my WORD stands true.

"I bought a condo in the area and this is the closest Starbucks to me excluding the mall and old town. 

Every single time I come here, my drink is made wrong. I order it the same at every Starbucks so I don't know how else to make them understand. 

The problem I have is the lack of customer service. 

For the most part I would just let it go and drink it. After about the 5th or 6th time I started asking for it to be re made. I would get an attitude when I would ask or snarky comments. 

For example, I can tell just by looking at the color of my coffee if it's wrong. So I kindly told her before she handed it to me that it's too dark and will be too strong. She had it remade then told me it didn't look any different than before. I said I could tell the difference. She again stated she couldn't. Then told me the lighting inside is different that outside. 

The final straw was when I went yet again. I could tell it was wrong. Again it was too dark. When I asked for her to remake it, she dumped out about half and put milk in it.
It tasted horrible!! Like watered down milk. My pumps of syrup were either not added properly or were dumped out. I took that drink down the street to the Thomas and scottsdale location. The guy working was so nice. I was honest and told him what happened. He apologized and remade my drink for free even though it wasn't that stores fault. He told me they have a ton of people go in their location with the same complaints about the other Starbucks. He remade my drink, had me taste it, and made sure I liked it.

"This company is really difficult to do business with.  Extremely unresponsive.  We decided to change insurances in January because we thought Embrace would offer better coverage.  In short, I would stay far, far away.

Initially, they had difficulty in getting the documentation from our vets.  I decided to do all the leg work myself - only to be told when I called the vet, oh, we already sent this to the insurance company.  Ok.... So, I had the vet send the records to me to forward on.   Only to be told that they still didn't receive anything.  After a phone call, it was determined that it was in fact included in the attachment, and it was overlooked. 

Six months after our initial enrollment, we are still trying to determine what is considered a pre-existing condition.  We received a list of exclusions on 4\/20.  We sent in our initial appeal on 4\/27.  We sent in a follow up asking for a response on 5\/22.  Still no response.  I just sent another follow up.

Ironically enough, as I am writing this review, I just received a response.  I should 'expect to hear back with a decision within 15 business days'.  Third time's a charm.

Update:  I increased my star rating.  I received closure the next day (after the third attempt).  The exclusion we appealed was revoked.  Now that we are through the paperwork \/ set up phase, I am hopeful for an easier relationship moving forward.",1.0

"I was sold by the smell the second I walked through the door. My dad owns a small business in the area, and this is one of his favorite spots for lunch. It replaced Belfiores, which was very similar to Dino's- Italian deli\/bakery\/restaurant. I was bummed when we lost Belfiores, but Dinos has it beat.

"We were a group of 3 and this was my first time in this pub, the food was ok and the ambiance was ok, however at the end my friend tipped 15% of the bill (before taxes), and for no reason, the waitress suddenly began arguing with my friend asking him to pay 15% or else he will not be welcomed anymore, that's the rules.
 During my entire life, I've never seen a waitress\/waiter telling a client that he is not welcome if he doesn't pay tips,,,,at least we all paid , and I paid the waitress 20%.
If I was an owner I will never allow my waiters to speak like that with a client, that's not good for business. So either the owners of this pub should review their policies or there is waitress issue.

"As far as pizza parlors go, this establishment ranks supreme on my palate.

The forge comes deliciously close to Pomo, in that their pizza is certified Neapolitan. From the  wood burning Mugnaini that cooks the pizzas perfectly at 700 degrees, these thin but extremely flavorful slices give you an experience akin to a traditional Italian Pizzeria.  

You may not be a pepperoni pizza fan, but a die hard cheese pizza lover converted to this pepperoni pizza (per recommendation of the server) and never looked back. It's the savory play between the red onion and pepperoni, combined with the heat of the jalapenos, and the subtle sweetness of the San Marzano tomatoes. Bake the above on an unleavened dough that doesn't come frozen or prepackaged,  and you have an amazingly fresh tasting pizza.

Aside from the pizza offerings,  there are surprisingly delectable plates to be enjoyed here. A healthy must try (especially for $6 during happy hour) is the arugula salad.  A whole lot of crispy fresh green with the crunch of croutons and radishes, shaved Italian Grana cheese, Finished with an incredible lemon anchovy vinaigrette. 

Love the crispy brussel sprouts and deep fried cheese curds, two polar opposites but both dishes that spell comfort and joy on the lips.

Intoxicants are always well made, balanced,  and beautifully paired with their ingredients. I highly recommend the ""Devil's Slipper"" with tequila, hibiscus, and agave.

"Working downtown I always welcome an alternative to the usual food court fare.  Falafel Avenue's focus is on falafel as you might have guessed from the name and is an excellent option if you are in the McGill area.  Prices are reasonable and the food is great.

There are a variety of falafels and they bake them which makes them healthier.  You choose the ones you want and you can also choose between having them in a classic pita, sandwich, etc.  You can also get a trio which includes a drink and choice of either fries, salad or dessert.  My only complaint is that they were out of what I originally wanted and it was only the beginning of the lunch rush.  I still ended up enjoying my classic pita falafel  but they need to plan for busy periods a little better.  Also the fries are pretty delicious.

In the beginning the food was very acceptable.  Not great but good enough. Then the quality started to slip.  Burritos were sometimes too greasy, not every time but too often. The consistency in quality is nonexistent. One time the beans are super and the next time they have no seasoning at all.  More often then not the beans are in the bottom and everything else is in the top. Their Carne is of poor quality with a lot of gristle. The chile relleno tonight was not lightly battered and deep fried like usual. There was a big gloppy  mess of  batter in the bottom of my burrito not even attached to the pepper which was of course in the top of the burrito.

I would have liked to order from the butcher counter but we were visiting from out of town and didn't have a way to prep any food. We opted for the roast chicken sandwich instead. The sandwich ($8.50) was huge and stuffed with a lot of roast chicken. I wasn't very impressed with the roast chicken itself though - I just didn't notice anything particularly flavorful or interesting about it. Just chicken. The crispy skin inside the sandwich made each bite a little more delightful than it would have been without it though. I'd love to come back someday and order from the butcher counter.

"My 14 year old daughter was talked into buying a $100 hair straightener from the young girl at the kiosk. The moment she came to me she knew her mistake and turned around to get her money back. The salesgirl switched from cool awesome salesperson to evil heartless sociopath immediately. She told my daughter, ""I care more about paying my bills than you getting in trouble at home."" My daughter bursts into tears and the salesgirl calls the manager telling her in exasperated disgust ""the girl is legit crying here"". She passed on the manager's insistence of the no return policy and told her that ""if her dad got mad, then she should live with her mother"". My daughter comes back to me feeling helpless and distraught. I go to the kiosk and demand the money be returned telling her that it wasn't 10 minutes before my daughter asked for a return and that the return policy doesn't pertain here since you cannot enter into a contract with a minor anyway. She calls the manager with I assume the same exasperation she displayed for my daughter, got approval to do the return and proceeded to lecture me on how I should educate my daughter in the rules of shopping.

They called me a week after I moved in and said they made an error on calculating my move in amount and I owed them an extra $100 dollars.

Another thing that surprised me was that they use hot stones. I've never had that at a Chinese foot massage place before so that's a nice add on. 

The reason I gave this place a 4 stars instead of 5 is that the chairs are old and fairly hard. There are even ash trays built in to the chairs. (Just to prove their age). But the lack of padding didn't affect the comfort of my massage and the place seems pretty clean. The towels they use to cover your body don't quite cover from arm to arm but lucky for me there was no draft (I get cold easily).",1.0
"What a neat little treasure in downtown Cleveland. Now for those that know Cleveland you'll remember that it is pretty much a town in a state of constant repair. As an old rust belt city its manufacturing (especially automotive) times are long gone and the rebuilding of the downtown continues. It seems like fully half the buildings in the Gateway District are under repair or refurbishment and many of the others are being repurposed...and that is where you will find Heinen's. 

Heinen's is a grocery store chain in the Cleveland area and this particular one is in the downtown area (Gateway District) and it is built in an old bank building. The main lobby of the bank is a three-story rotunda and they just don't build stuff like this anymore. So here you have a neat little grocery store - sort of like a fancy Whole Foods store - centered in this wonderful rotunda filled with stained glass. 

The first floor here has a number of foods that you can package up and bring home or back to work for lunch or dinner...sort of a self-serve giant buffet. The second floor of the rotunda area has a wine and beer tasting area. Outside the rotunda area is the rest of the grocery store with the usual goods offered and literally hundreds of selections. 

Being downtown in a rebuilding city they are very aware of street peeps and the like. Security is very good and you won't find people just wandering around. It is like most downtown buildings today...good security and a very safe environment. Given the location and the ambiance, this was a neat stop...give it a try.",1.0

I've stayed at Golden Gate about 5 times now. Once in their basic room, and 4 other times in their suite. (which is still cheeper than other casinos down there most of the time) This past weekend I stayed one night at Golden Nugget in their suite and two nights at Golden Gate for my honeymoon. Our stay at Golden Nugget was terrible and we paid top dollar to stay there, and as soon as we moved over to Golden Gate I felt right at home! From even just the valet guy it was once again such a great experience. 

Everyone was so great there from valet, check-in, the club card desk, dealers, cashiers, security, the restaurant, it was a perfect stay! We ended up staying an extra night because it was such a blast. We did have the one bedroom suite and the best were cozy, pillows were awesome, we needed some extra towels and they were quick to bring them to us! Extremely accommodating!

"The absolute worst customer service I've ever experienced. Each person I talked to while staying at the Silverton was very rude and condescending. While staying at the hotel, I spilled soda on some of my boyfriends clothes so I asked for dry cleaning and when I went to pay for JUST the dry cleaning, they charged my card and drained all my money, plus I owed my bank over $300. That day my boyfriend decided to check his bank records and the silverton drained his account too. All his money, gone. We went to the front desk to get it straightened out, talked to both the assistant manager and the manager and both we not very willing to help. They said it wasn't them and after they messed around on the computer a bit, his money was back yet the still deny taking it. How is it not them when we did nothing but talk to the front desk when we saw it was missing, and now it's magically back? 
After two days, I got my money back as well. But they never said sorry or offered any compensation. We had no money. It was our last day in Vegas.

"I only go here when I can't get into Burgatory and because I enjoy the outdoor area with the firepit which is a pretty cool atmosphere.  Their really unhealthy food options like the loaded fries or loaded tots are pretty good, but their healthier food options are really lacking.  I tried to get the blackened fish tacos and the fish was really dry and overcooked and of poor quality.  The tortillas were completely stale and hard and had large gashes down the middle.  They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.

"I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about Tim and his crew at Ameripro of Gilbert. From the initial estimate to the last day of the job, Tim, Clem, and the crew of painters were prompt, courteous, thorough, and careful. Our home looks amazing! As if the attention to detail and daily check-ins by Clem weren't service enough, the crew helped me fix a broken garage door as they were leaving on the final day of painting.

The broken door had nothing to do with their work, but as we were going to store the additional touch-up paint in our garage, the opener moved and the door didn't. After helping me to find the problem, Clem went to the truck to get some of his own screws to fix the door. The three remaining crew members, Clem, and I gathered in our garage, and these guys worked to fix it, after what I am sure was a long, hot, and exhausting day for them. They could have easily just left since the broken door was not at all related to the painting. But they didn't! They stayed until the door was fixed, saving us from an expensive service call to a garage door repairman.

"I wanted to write an update:

First off, I'm very glad that the owner reads the reviews and that she took the time to respond to my mine. I've been back dozens of times since as I love the food. I do have a few more observations to share. 

Customer service does not seem to improve. I notice new employees every time I come so I assume that the turn over is pretty high. Most of the girls are not knowledgable and move Very slowly.

I was in with a girlfriend of mine a few weeks ago and we couldn't even get utensils even after the food dropped. No one paid attention to us. After I got up and asked for some I got a weird vibe about it. No ones comes by later to check on tables, at least this is what my perception was. 

Last week I was dining at the bar and a woman came, new to the place, and asked for a to go menu. The girls handed her a business card. I would at least attempt to say something like ""we are paper free here, please visit us online to see a full menu"". The lady then took a dine-in menu and perused through. Finally, she hails one of the serves and said that she is ready to order. The two girls either didn't hear or they ignored her. She was becoming antsy and it was obvious she needed assistance. A server walked by her to look after guests who came in after her and she had to stop the girl in her path and explain she was asking for help, with a bit of frustration. The server's answer was ""oh... Okay."" No apology or enthusiasm. Yikes. 

On to me:  Last week I had stopped in three times. Once to pick up a 16oz drink-- I was given the smallest container I've ever seen. I am pretty certain that was not 16 oz. it looked more like 8oz. Starbucks grande cup is 16oz and what I got was half of that. I think the very Least a server should know are the serving sizes so that customers are not wasting their money. The Castaway smoothie was delicious though. Really awesome stuff. I did a small spoon of peanut butter instead of almond and it was excellent. 

Second time that week I had a dinner special, I think. It was the Hippy Chick burger and it came with warm seasoned kale and a side of potato mash with gravy. This was absolutely incredible. My burger lacked mayo but I added some ketchup to it and it was great. I ate it with a side of cole slaw, which was also amazing but very Extra creamy. It was swimming in liquidy mayo. It was delicious but too creamy for me. I then ate the kale and mash together. I have to say this was probably the best potato mash I've ever had (other than the ""real"" stuff I make with butter and half&half). The kale was amazing with it, although a pinch too salty. 

This was literally two meals in one and I was beyond satisfied. 

On my third visit I had the falafel pita with cole slaw and a side of fries. The pita itself was absolutely incredible. I loved the texture. I am not sure if it's gluten free but it certainly was Awesome. Other than this, the dish was very bland. The falafels have an excellent potential but were seriously under seasoned; also there were still half bits of chickpeas in them. I'm not sure if this is done on purpose. The mix could have used a lot more cumin, salt and pepper. They were also very crunchy on the outside but not in a good way. They were tiny bits of something that for me, makes me fear I'll chip a tooth. If a little more TLC was put into the preparation, the falafel would have been amazing. 

The hummus inside my pita was flavorless. Literally, it was just blended chickpeas. There was no salt, no pepper, I could not taste tahini in it nor lemon juice. 
I asked for tahini in my pita and tzatziki on the side. I did not taste any tahini in there. You can't miss it, it's a very earthy distinct taste. I guess they forgot to tell the chef. Also, a stuffed pita without onions is like milk without a cookie. The flavor profile was seriously undermined with that omission. 

I had to put a ton of pepper and a bit of salt to pump flavor into this dish. I also added a squeeze of lemon juice. These three things alone elevated the dish to another level. 

My fabulous fries came out without seasoning. I also had to add salt and pepper to them. The cole slaw was perfect amount of creamy and well, that's about it. No salt, nada. I added lemon to it to which helped immediately. 

I feel the chef who worked that day absolutely despises seasoning because everything was so bland and flavorless. 

I have to say that a $10 dish, where a customer gets 3 falafels and a bland experience, is overpriced. Across the way, Sababa's makes a Killer falafel sandwich with the Works for like $8. 

Side note: I sat at the bar for an hour and half looking at a dirty table to my left. It was cleaned up right before I left. There were other tables that weren't bussed but this one was a mess for quite a long time.

"This is the most ignorant bar I have ever been in. If your not a regular they must want nothing to do with you. I went in with my parents and I today and we were looking to have a cocktail and maybe some appetizers on the way home from a family outing. We ordered our drinks and the first thing the barmaid was worried about was checking my id, I'm 35. Lol she poured our drink and I asked if she had a appetizer platter. The barmaid said ""no"" and walked away. She never offered a recommendation or something to order, she just walked away. She then handed me my tab. It was 10 dollars and I left a 2 dollar tip. My mother then made a comment to her about how tight the bar was and the ""highly intelligent"" barmaid, who is obviously good with small talk, just shrugged her shoulders. I decided to walk out. I was willing to spend possibly 60 to 80 dollars worth of money to drinks and appetizers to this bar, but we decided to walk out with 12 dollars paid. Come here with your own risk!",1.0
"This place came highly recommended by a friend and we decided to give it a try. It is small, cozy and charming - so definitely call ahead as it can get crowded even on a weekday.

Definitely one of the best meals we had in Montreal!",1.0
"I've been here a few times, I can't believe I never wrote a review.

Their gyro sandwiches are solid.  They really stuff the sandwich and its nice because its not super greasy.  I've had their steak sandwich too - its weird how they package it kind of like an open faced sandwich, but it's decent.  It's chopped bite sized pieces of sirloin.  They season it pretty well but its a tiny bit tougher than I like.  The fries are decent though I like them crispier.  Everything tastes pretty fresh.  I kind of prefer the greek salad which they do a great job with, and you get a lot.  

The baklava is also a wonderful addition to your meal.

I wouldn't get the chicago hot dog or anything, but other items are priced well so you get a pretty good value for your money.  The food is freshly made, seasoned well, and portioned nicely.  The wait is a bit long if you don't phone in your order ahead of time but this place is definitely a try if you're in the neighborhood.",1.0

They did not impress me at all, and I am not middle eastern, but know what good food is. Quantity of chicken was not enough, they didn't even have the right consistency in their sauces, they didn't even know how to wrap up the bread properly. To top it off; the place is cash only. They charge tax but their receipt didn't display their HST number on it. Seems like they are collecting sales tax but not reporting it to the government.

"Been here a good couple of times during my trips to Vegas and let me tell you, it's one of the nicer Pho places but typical priced meals! We came Saturday at 12pm and it was a 10 minute wait, not bad at all. I got the rice plate with pork and egg rolls. But the wait to get our food took forever! I was staaaarving. I think it was because they mixed up our order with another table. But our meal was satisfying and good. Wish they gave more meat but it was cool. My total came out to $12ish (included tip) and we paid at the register. If you're a tourist and need a ride back to the strip, I suggest calling for a cab right before you finish your meal because we had to wait 30 minutes after for ours to arrive.

"Okay. I know what you're thinking - five stars? But trust.

After a spooky Halloween event in downtown, my friends and I were hungry after driving back uptown. We looked on Yelp for a late night place and Chen's (not to be confused with the restaurant in Waterloo) was what we stumbled upon.

We ordered mainly wings and skewers. China's late night drunk foods of choice includes meat skewers and they can range from super salty to charred and smoky. I've had better skewers but these were pretty good too. Though the restaurant is small and it was late, there were still other people. They ranged from mafia looking dudes to two ladies just getting off their restaurant shifts. All were having beer along with their snacks.

So why such a high rating? Well, the wings were seasoned and cooked beautifully; the service was great. The wings were tiny compared to your usually steroid-wings from St. Louis and the like - but that might not be such a terrible thing. Dry-seasoned, they were crispy (but not battered) on the outside and juicy on the inside. At two wings a skewer, it's a lil pricy. But they're done very well. My only complaint is that you go through a lot pretty quickly (especially when you gotta share with hungry guys).

We walked in at around 1am and stayed until almost 3. The sole girl managing the front of the restaurant was polite, responsive and cheerful. Yep, even that late at night. We only had a slight lost in translation moment but she was patient and worked with us, not against.

A part of the Chinese name of this restaurant translates directly to ""friends"". I think it captures the feel perfectly. You go here with your friends for a friendly experience. Will be back for sure!",1.0
"Meh. Not bad, but definitely not great.

I can't really say it's a wannabe Hooters - but they are definitely looking to attract a certain crowd, that's why they are located a short walk from the arena and stadium.

We went in on a Saturday afternoon before a game, expecting a crowd. There wasn't really anyone there - we had 1 beer and left. We had already eaten, so we didn't even look at the menu.  The beer selection is good, but not great. They could definitely improve there.

We sat at the bar and although she wasn't rude, the bartender definitely wasn't friendly either. Turns out it was just about the end of her shift and she must've just been ready to go. The guy who replaced her was much nicer, but we were just ready to go at that point.

It costs us almost $18 for 1 cider and 1 beer - which is pretty high, in my opinion. But I guess expected, based on the location. I'm not a big fan of this chain to begin with, and this location certainly did nothing to change my mind.

My suggestion is to avoid it and find a better local spot.",1.0
"Dinner is very good. $17. But more sushi options, sashimi, and roast beef makes it worth it if you are hungry.
For lunch and dinner, They have the normal Chinese selections but also have some Korean type food like kal-bi. It is a little dry but still ok for non-Korean place.
They have two types of ribs which are pretty tasty.

With scoops of ice cream, cakes, and cookies, dessert selection is solid.

We had pulled pork nachos, pulled chicken sandwich with slaw and hushpuppies, and a chicken bacon sandwich. I could have eaten it all with my eyes alone. So glad to have used my mouth instead! 

Hushpuppies were hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. We had freshly cooked tortilla chips with that DELICIOUS dip of nacho sauce and tender pulled pork. The slaw and mustard sauce that came with my sandwich were seriously good enough to eat on their own.

"Let's start with the atmosphere it's super cool and there is so much to see. So much that it being my first time there I was confused and overwhelmed. I manage a café so coffee is kind of my expertise ... Ice cream is another favorite of mine and their mix ins are over the top with choices. 

3 of us went. My partner got an affagato (which we normally love almost anywhere) and she couldn't finish it because the espresso was too bitter. Could be her tastebuds but, none the less this was her complaint. 

I tried the soy coffee ice cream and it was like a jelly consistency that I didn't think I could stomach so against my better judgement I went with birthday cake ice cream (no mix ins) no complaints other than ice cream kills my stomach. 

My son got vanilla ice cream with Reese's cups (keeping it simple) he got a whole scoop and when it came out of the mixer it was barely half a cup. This led to disappointment when I went to pay and gasped at $16 bill for 3 tiny items. They are way over priced even if they are in shady side. Another downfall is that if you pay with a credit card they charge you an extra $1 to the already out of this world prices. Would I go back? Probably not I'm glad I saw the store and their cool decor but, for the lack of being impressed it's a no go. 

On the plus side the two girls who were working were very kind and helpful but the service was insanely slow. 3 people ahead of us and we waited nearly 20 minutes for sheer disapointment.",1.0

I almost didn't want to post a review because of how embarrassing it is to admit I stayed here.  This hotel was by far the worst hotel I've ever experienced.  We were only passing thru Vegas as we traveled from Sequoia National park to Zion National park. We used Hotwire and skipped the review thinking Hotwire would've screened this hotel.  Well I will say that this place should not even be able to rent rooms.  The edges of the tub was disgusting and the carpet smelled like cigarette and marijuana smoke combined.  The sliding doors to the balcony were a safety hazard and the beds were like army cots (I'm an Army Vet).  This place should be condemned and then perhaps renovated by a super rich pool of investors.  Terrible.  Like I said I'm embarrassed that we even stayed there.  FML,1.0

"I was excited to see a new pizza place open near home. I wanted to like it. Seriously, I wanted to like it. It's a new chain. Feels like a Moe's serving pizza. You know, the ""hello"" as EVERYBODY walks in the front door. Place is new and there are a few kinks to still work out. Understandable. I am sure they will get there. Service was pretty good. You walk-in, order and then pay. They write your name on the paper that goes under the pizza. Lots of toppings to choose from. I ordered a Caesar salad and Dillion James. Salad was ready in minutes. Pizza was ready in about 5-6 minutes. Salad was good. 
The pizza-eh, it was not good at all. The crust is formed out of a dough ball that is pressed flat by a machine, topped and then put in the oven. The dough was overly chewy, cheese just melted but not cooked long enough for my liking. 
The dining environment-nice but seriously felt as if I was sitting in an employee break room. Manager or owner sitting in the left corner on laptop, crew on break eating and sitting, working staff constantly coming over to chat with those in the corner. Oh, and those folks yelling ""hello"" was even more annoying. Just didn't make for a nice dining space.

Yes, it's true the slices are as big as your head. Such novelty may lead you to believe that this place is all about size (*hey now*). Not true at Crust!  I've quickly become a regular to this pizza\/salad\/sub joint near China Town. The pizza is excellent, sold by both the slice and whole pie. The crust (the best part) is chewy and crispy with a soft center. Melts in your mouth. The toppings are super fresh. No canned mushrooms here! 

The subs are my new fav. They make the bread fresh every day. Same goodness as the pizza. A big pet peeve of mine is biting in to a sub with crusty bread and having the contents spray my lunch mate in the face. Not happening at Crust. The bread is crusty enough to have a good texture, but soft enough to bite through easily. So far, I've tried the Philly, Chicken Parm and Club. All are excellent. 

If you want something sweet, I highly recommend the brownie. It's cake-like, nice and gooey and rich. Leave some room for these babies!

"Best Ceviche in Montreal. Fabulous Tacos. Wonderful Service

If you are not eating ceviche here, you are doing it wrong. There is nothing like their ceviche in town. There are 4 choices of fish\/seafood to choose from, and you can then select 3 of (I think) 6 potential flavors (including mango).

"We stayed at the Blair House Suites for 3 nights this past weekend and we had a great hotel experience.  Each room has its own kitchen stocked with a fridge, a microwave, and a toaster, which is great when you are doing Vegas on a budget, bringing your own food and drinks.  We also ate at the restaurant twice and found the food to be delicious bar food.  I would absolutely recommend this smaller hotel to anyone visiting Vegas on a budget or looking for a hotel within walking distance to the Strip!",1.0

"The food here is good, but the best food in the world wouldn't outweigh the horrendous service I experienced here. I've never EVER been spoken to the way I was here, and over simply not knowing that a burrito came with guacamole.

I just moved to town and Fausto's is walking distance from my house, so I was excited to be able to walk to get Mexican food all the time. They've lost out on a lot of business from me, because I would have been coming on a very regular basis. Will not return. Especially with Roberto's only a few minutes away.",1.0

"I've been a vegetarian for over 12 years and eat a lot of raw \/ vegan \/ gluten free stuff (on account of my vegetarianism and my wife's dairy and wheat intolerance) so I should be in Kupfert & Kim's target demographic. But the first (and probably only) time I tried it, I wasn't feeling it at all. I paid like eleven bucks for this altogether inadequate box of rice, beans and miniscule amounts of vegetables (I had the 'Kim'). It advertised tofu as being part of the meal but I don't think that the one, puny cube counts. I know that organic food can be quite pricey so I'm almost willing to forgive the fact the tiny portion but the fact that the thing was also quite bereft of flavor is far more egregious. 

I feel sort of bad and it's the type of place I really want to support and like but at the same time I'm not going to spend $11.00 for something that is barely more than a snack and isn't even that tasty.

"My home warranty company sent this company to my house because my heat wasn't working correctly. We had heat but it wasn't heating all the rooms.

I told him to check again, he came back down saying he found the heater but it's not large enough for your whole house, then recommended we just buy some space heaters. Then after he went back up in the attic he comes down and tells us the AC isn't a dual heating and cooling and we need to buy a whole new system. The tech didn't seem like he had any idea of what he was doing and upon calling a different company they came over and found the problem which was only a coil that needed to be replaced not buying a whole new heating system.",1.0

The place was fairly quiet for a Saturday night.  The layout was simple and a couple of TVs had a ballgame on.  We had to move from our first table after the ceiling fan above us was placed next to the recessed lighting and was giving my wife and I a strobe light effect.

The sandwich was good but not great.  The potato salad I ordered for my side dish was delicious.   My wife like their sweet tea and she seemed satisfied with her French dip.

The place felt too much like a chain, which it is, I was hoping for a different vibe from a deli.

"What a great find!!!! Today was my first visit since moving to this state recently. I am very used to San Diego nail places. That means cheap and excellent quality. So, I am extremely picky about nails especially acrylics!! I like them thin and to have a very elongated appearance without being long. My nails are gorgeous. Dana was my technician and she was such a sweetheart! She was amazingly fast. 

The only reason why I deducted points are as follows:

I made an appointment and they were about 10 minutes late. I did call only about 45 minutes before to set it but still. 

The nail brushes are too soft and are not disinfected after each clients use. Which makes me wonder about getting a pedicure here.

"The deadbolt to my home had me locked out. Really. The key would turn, but the bolt did not turn. Great, how do I find a locksmith on a 106 degree monsoon Saturday afternoon so that I can get back into my air conditioned home?

After a Yelp and an Internet search I found Tempe Locksmith. They said they would have someone there in 25 minutes. The locksmith tech was a contractor from callorange.com (NOT from Tempe Locksmith) and it took 45 minutes not 25 minutes.

I knew that the deadbolt would have to be drilled out and a new one installed, so I stopped by Lowe's and picked up a new one for $29. Liran was the tech and he did a great job and re-keyed the lock to my house key at no extra charge.

Drill out old deadbolt=$154

"Working close by, I get takeout from here a lot. So, while I can't claim to know what their table service is like, their takeout always takes just about 15 minutes.

And as an extra plus, it usually lasts me for two days of lunches.

You know how you have things on your to-do list but it takes you forever to do it?  Well I have been meaning to post this forever!  My mom took me here for my birthday last July (2014).  The up side: The food was delicious!!  The down side: one of the cooks dropped an entire spit of lamb on the floor when he was adjusting it.  The thing that happened next is the reason that I have not been back.  They proceed to take it to the back kitchen and not even five minutes later they come back with a new spit of lamb and it's dripping wet!!  I was shocked and disgusted.  I would love to go back because the food was good but I can't get over them just washing off the lamb and bringing it back out.  I'm sorry it's taken me so long to post folks.,1.0
"This is a great locally owned and operated bakery & espresso bar.  The owner is incredibly friendly, as well as passionate about what she's doing.

We ate our salad combo with our main course, and at the end of the meal we noticed a nasty black hair in the hummus. When the waitress came to pick up our plates, my wife politely told her about the hair. She told us she would remove it from the bill, but when she came back with the credit card machine, she told us her manager would not take it off the bill because we waited too long. I was a little shocked but paid anyways. On the way out, my wife went to see the manager to voice her disgust, and he listened for a moment, then told her to shut up and get out of his restaurant.

"Tried Preston's for the first time tonight, and as a loyal Mastro's diner I have to say that my Filet was cooked to perfection. I have never had a steak prepared as perfectly at Mastro's or Steak 44 so that right there gets five stars from me. To top off the perfect steak they have a very large selection of sides including multiple preparations of Mac and Cheese, potatoes and corn all of which at least matched if not bested Mastro's quality and definitely price. My sister and father shared the whole chicken which is carved table side, and I have to comment that the piece I tried was so tender and juicy I didn't need a knife to cut it. Being on the same corner as Mastro's I would choose Prestons's most of time going forward. Now not to make Phil feel bad I will still visit Mastro's for the butter cake and shrimp cocktail and the seasonal brunches, Prestons's is a great addition to North Scottsdale.",1.0

We did not mind because they have such a huge selection that it really satisfied both of our palates albeit being very different! It's honestly the best kbbq in town. I am also one for service and our server, Seong, made the experience all the more pleasant! He was so attentive and quick.

"Went there for my birthday at breakfast time. Ordered their big breakfast which consisted of 3 scrambled eggs, 2 pcs bacon, 2 sausage links, cottage type potatoes and two pancakes. Let start with the time I ordered and the time I got my food. Try 21 minutes. I get buzzed to go pick up my food at the window, was never greeted at all. They just opened the sliding door and pushed out my orange tray with two black plates full of food. The scrambled eggs were cold and dry and unflavorful. They did add green chopped onions for color I guess but they had no flavor at all...quite bland. The potatoes weren't bad but neither anything to write home about. The sausage links as well as the bacon were on a second 8inch black plastic plate and were greasy, very greasy. My guess is that they put them over the pancakes so they will absorb all the grease. YUK!  The pancakes were some sort of a bright yellow color with brown glow to them. Huh, never seen anything like them before. Pancakes were cold,very flat and awfully dry.  No syrup was give to me and I had to go ask for it after the fact. The utensils and napkins are all out doors, you literally have to go outside to the backyard and get them yourself. It was raining this morning when I went and there just seemed to be alot of confusion going on with even the amount of customers they had. I believe that there was maybe a total of 7-8 folks dining when I got there. I tried looking for a manager to tell him or her about my meal but they were nowhere in sight. Food menu item are way overpriced as well. I have been here before a few years back and it seems that the quality,service and attitude toward the business has somewhat declined.  I will more than likely stay away from this place for sometime and try it again in a couple of years again. They need to do some serious house cleaning if you know what I mean.",1.0

The prices are split between meat only or meat with seafood. The meat with seafood package includes AYCE fountain drinks and fresh seafood such as lobster, shrimp and mussels. The rest veggies and meat are ayce and split in a small portion manner. So no left overs.

They are run by the same owner of Korean Grill House so it has the same atmosphere and type of service. Even the serving plates are the same.

"So first off, this place has excellent dumplings. We got the pork ones, and just super flavorful and not crunchy, just the right consistency, topped with flavorful vegetables.

I ordered a pork belly ramen - thinking mistakenly that this meant tonkatsu. Nope, no tonkatsu ramen. The pork ramen comes out with roasted palm hearts, kimchi, roasted pork belly, green onions and a soft boiled egg garnished with Togarashi. The egg yolk was already broken on mine which is usually not a big deal. But my problem was the broth.

Totally utterly flavorless broth. My partner noticeably saw my face go from yay I'm gonna get some ramen to sad face in record time. It needed salt too which for a pork ramen is kind of ludicrous. I liked the consistency of the noodles though, so yay for that. The pork in the ramen was ok, though it could've been a bit more tender. My partner's lemon grass chicken ramen was also weak in the broth area though the other flavors came together a bit better overall in that one.

I will definitely check this place out for their other dishes. The decor is awesome and has great ambiance and wait staff are friendly, but the ramen failed this city, as The Arrow would say.",1.0
"It is a shame that Cluny falls into the category of good food ruined by terrible service. 

I have dined at Cluny a few times in this year and have been bothered by the lack of check-ins and water refills.

That being said, I do actually find the food pretty good. The tomahawk veal meatball is great and I have yet to find a restaurant that does souffle consistently well. Cluny probably still has the most reliable food in the Distillery District that isn't outrageously expensive.

"Miracle worker!!! I found Emme on Instagram after seeing a before and after pic of one of her clients. I had lost ALL hope with my adult acne (Let's be honest...It never went a way since I was 12, so yeah) I was on the verge of doing a cycle of Accutane when I decide instead of all the health risks, I'd try her program.  I am a LONG DISTANCE client and after 45 days my skin is COMPLETELY transformed! Oil production is a fraction of what it used to be, my skin is super smooth and my breakouts are literally gone. 
    The difference is this: dermatologists prescribe antibiotics and creams... Once your body adjusts to them, the treatment stops working.(plus, who wants to take antibiotics forever?) It doesn't address the ROOT of the problem. Emme does just that and you really feel her empathy and desire to see you clear and happy. She dotes on her clients all the time!
    If you are on the fence about calling Emme up, let me tell you this:  I have been hiding behind makeup for 22 years.   (literally, hiding) I've tried every antibiotic, cream and did two cycles of Accutane years ago and it always comes back, usually worse! People who love me would tell me I'm beautiful and that they don't even notice my acne, but it never changed how I felt about ME.  I don't feel like I need to hide anymore and that is worth its weight in gold to me!  So thankful I found her!",1.0
"This is my first attempt at writing a review as I'm eating, which is maybe that's the best compliment I can give; this place has motivated me to provide my real-time opinion. So far, everything has been excellent. The spicy lobster and seared ahi tuna appetizers are two cant-go-wrong selections. 

(And so much for my real time opinion, which may be the ""second"" best compliment I can give. When my steak arrived my primal instincts switched to EAT and my opinion took a back seat.) 

So now here I am several days later and I'm still completely impressed with this meal. I've known about Ruth's Chris for a long time and have heard nothing but great things but honestly because it's a chain, I sort of shrugged it off. I'm just more of a hidden gem kind of guy. Thankfully I ventured out of my box and into the private elevator at Harrah's that leads to the beautiful view belonging to Ruth's Chris. Unfortunately, we didn't get to soak in the view but that was actually fine with me. We showed up with no reservations during a busy March Madness weekend and were able to sit and eat immediately at the bar, which was great (bartenders always make the best servers.) After finishing our appetizers, I had a baked potato, the bone-in New York steak (a.k.a. ""The distraction"") and the banana cream pie. The baked potato was standard but the steak was amazing and big enough to feed two, easy. The banana cream pie, unlike the potato, was far from standard and is a must try for banana cream and non-banana cream fans alike. I'm a huge fan but my brother is not and we both loved it.

"Worst AC company ever! Was told by two people my report for my unit would be to the home warranty company by the end of the day. It WASN'T! I was told by the owner I should be grateful I only had to pay my trade fee and not the $2-3 grand the repair would cost and that I should find some friends with a pool to stay with. ...I have two kids under the age of three and a dog! I called for the next few days, nothing. I filed a negative review on the BBB for them not doing what they said they would. They heard that. Then they refused to do the job because we spoke negatively of them online. We had a new company come out. They were great.

We are so grateful for Monica's professional services and advice. She recently booked our honeymoon trip to Punta Cana Dominican Republic and it was AMAZING! The hotel was gorgeous just like the brochure and well above our expectations. They took excellent care of us from the moment we checked in until the time we checked out. We actually called Monica from the hotel and asked her to upgrade our flights home for comforts sake and she pulled it off. We couldn't be more happy. We have booked a second trip to the east coast through her and can't wait. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!,1.0

"I used to like Big Dog but after a while it tends to loose its luster. My biggest pet-peeve is the squatters.

Seating tends to be small since students squat their and push together tables taking up a lot of space. They bring in outside food like subway and nobody says anything to them. It's also a frequent spot for American Eagle corporate employees so it looks like yuppy central. Which makes no sense since they have coffee from Starbucks brought in to corporate and can get it for a dollar. 

Speaking of price, I don't think they would have to charge as much if they didn't have people hogging up tables. If I were the owners, I'd just kill the wifi altogether to get rid of them. If you're looking to sit and relax and enjoy some tea, I'd suggest staying at home. The prices are too high and they serve it in a giant mug so it looses heat quickly. pretty soon you're just drinking cold tea.

So if you are out shopping and want a drink I'd suggest you go someplace else for your quirky cool cafe stop. Big Dog has become more of a yuppy overflow room. No thanks.",1.0

He mentioned I could get the tires next day with a $100 deposit for the order.  I work just around the corner from this location, so I paid the deposit in person - but they have it set up so you can pay online via pay pal if that is easier for you.

"This is one of the only places in Mississauga I've seen that has Malaysian food. My favourite dish is the Nasi Goreng (Malaysian Fried Rice) and their Fried Radish Cake. It's delicious! The curry and roti is also quite good. Also, my favourite drink is the Cold Milk Tea. This is not your typical Asian restaurant because you'll see a lot of dishes offered here that aren't offered in other places. Nasi Lemak is a standard Malaysian dish my boyfriend is a huge fan of. 

The prices are a little high, so I only come here occasionally. Service can be quite fast, but a lot of times, it's slow because the owners are an elderly couple. I understand that, and I appreciate that they've brought on other servers for busier days. The restaurant itself is quite small, and service isn't amazing, but that's expected from most of the restaurants in this plaza. If you know someone who can cook Malaysian food at home, then you'll save a lot of money by eating with them! While the food here is not the absolute best, it's good enough for me to say that it's worth a visit if other types of Asian cuisine (IE not just Chinese) appeal to you.",1.0

Went for a regular manicure, as I have an event after work and felt my nails could use some colour.  

Didn't realize that Polish'd only does ""dry"" manicures.  So no soaking, no warm cloths, etc.  You're given the choice of lotion OR a scrub.  I chose the scrub mostly because after being filed and buffed, I really thought my hands could use a wash!  So they lead you over to a sink, and you wash your hands there at the sink with the sugar scrub, and then back to the chair for the polish.

The chairs are uncomfortable... you want to sit high up at the counter, but you can't without jamming your knees... so you have to sit much lower than feels right.   (I should note that before they started, they were one chair short, and despite having an appointment, they asked if they could start me on the bench under the polish selections....  being pregnant and uncomfortable, and having an appt, I hesitated until they noticed a proper chair was coming right up, so I luckily got that....).

The 30-minute manicure was rushed and over in 20 minutes, and I was then ushered back to the bench while they powered through others.

I appreciate a place that is efficient and quick for a lunch-hour place... but I've definitely had better $25-manicures.

Oh - and I used a $30 gift card, and was left with $4 or $5.   I asked them to use that to tip the girl, and was told they can't tip off gift cards.  Hmm... so I had to pull that money out of my purse, and now I'm left with $4 or $5 that I might never use... Didn't seem fair.

Finally they had some young girl wrap my fingers to take off what was left of the other get polish.  I'm pretty sure she does not have a license.  I sat there wrapped for a good 30 min.  A guy came and checked them and apparently the girl hadn't put enough acetone on so he had to redo them.  I was getting frustrated as when I got there he said it wouldn't be much of a wait and they were clearly behind. Why didn't he just tell me to come in an hour??  I finally took the wrapping off myself and used their tools to take off my gel polish.

We ordered two orders of the poutine on the happy hour menu. About 20 minutes, the food arrived. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worse.

I've had Lobster Rolls in San Diego, Santa Monica and now at this Lobster ME location in Las Vegas (Planet Hollywood) and THIS LOBSTER ROLL IS THE BEST! The meat is succulent, juicy, flavorful and fresh. If you're going to spend $18 on a sandwich, know that for a Lobster Roll, this one is worth it. It also comes with Kettle chips and cole slaw.

"Never. Coming. Back. The manager\/owner is a total jerk. We had Groupons that expired and should've been good for the value paid ($46).

"I've been using megabus to travel between montreal and toronto for the past 2 months. I've made 5 trips back and forth. Ticket price has ranged from $22 to $80. I give megabus 2 stars for three reasons. Number one, it's never reached the destination on time. It's been 25min to 3 hours late!!! Albeit it took 3 hours extra to reach toronto once because of construction on 401. However I am displeased that even with no traffic and no problems on the road (when I take 6am or arriving at 3am buses), we have never managed to reach on time. I'm lucky if I reach my destination 25min late. The average delay is 45min. I traveled in August and September, so weather was not a reason for the delays. 

Second reason for 2 stars, their washrooms are terrible. Clean to begin with but very uncomfortable for females. Very cramped and disgusting. I just avoid drinking water or anything before and during my megabus ride, and try my best to avoid the washroom for the 7 hours or so it takes. 

3rd reason is that the WiFi is weak and not reliable. 

Aside from this, seats are ok. The buses have always been clean. Having charging points for each seat was great.",1.0

I can call At&t for you and make an appointment or you can go across the street to verizon they will help you."" After multiple attempts to reach the store manager Abigail and asking for a call back and receiving nothing its plain to see sprint doesn't care about the service they provide or the customer who pays for their employees bills I'm glad I have switched my service to a better provider which Maggie herself recommended.

"My friends and I stopped in before a Pirates game to avoid the crowded bars closer to the stadium. Wow, did we pick a good spot for that. The downstairs had a few bar patrons by the time we left but the rooftop deck was all ours! One other table filled as we left. The rooftop has a full bar, attentive servers & large flat screen TV's. This would be a great spot to catch games this fall! 

We started with sangria & spiked lemonade that could be infused with blueberry, cherry or raspberry. The red sangria had a rich orange flavor and it wasn't too sweet. The lemonade was too sweet for me but the bartender made an infused version with less simple syrup & it was much better. In fact, it was dangerous because I couldn't taste the liquor! 

For an appetiter, our group ordered italian egg rolls. I can't eat gluten so these were out for me. They looked tasty! Italian meats & cheese rolled up and deep fried in a flour wrap, served with a creamy aioli dip. 

Everybody at the table ordered a burger with fries and I got the salmon salad. The burgers were quite large! Toppings were plentiful & the portion of fries for each person could have fed half of our table. Prices for burgers & sandwiches ranged from $9-$15

My salmon salad was good but plain & left me wanting more. It included sliced almonds, port infused cranberries and goat cheese. I ordered it without cheese and asked if they had avocado (they don't :( *sniffle*) I like my salads with a plentiful amount of veggies...cucumbers, onion, tomatoes, carrot, etc. For $14, I expected more.

"Absolutely horrible service. Our group bought a day bed and it was the worst decision ever. Our waitress was useless. We were lucky if she stopped by once every 45 minutes. She always was giving us excuses about how busy she was, but for $1,000 dollars that's not our problem. If she wasn't able to handle her work load then they should've given her some help. By the end we waited over an hour before we were able to flag her down to order some food, only to be told the kitchen closed a few minutes prior. Absolutely horrible service for what we paid.",1.0
"LOVE!! Been several times now, but I can't get myself to try something besides the cheese danish although it all looks good.

I had no idea danish could be this amazing.Their sandwiches are excellent as well. 

Some drawbacks: limited seating (indoor maybe 12 max, 6 outside), parking lot is annoying to get in and out of thanks to the never-ending Verona Rd construction mess, somewhat small menu, service can be a bit slow even when it isn't busy. However, I feel like the food is so awesome the drawbacks don't do much to detract from my enjoyment at all. GO!",1.0
"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: Tower 1, Suite 17608
The Good:  Tower 1 is the closest of the three towers to the MGM Hotel and Casino.  The resort is reached via three people-movers and it took about three minutes to reach the MGM pool area and the District (a shopping area between the Signature and the casino).  The other two towers add walks of about 5 to 10 minutes, respectively, to get to the MGM.  The monorail has a stop in the MGM and its entrance is about a 4-minute walk from Tower 1 - much closer than the main MGM property - a huge plus. The suite was large and nicely appointed.  The kitchen included a full-sized refrigerator, a dishwasher, stove top and oven, microwave, garbage disposer, and coffee maker (a little 4-cup machine).  The kitchen contained all of the essentials for cooking - pots and pans, silverware, glasses, mugs, etc.  Adjacent to the kitchen was a round dining table that seats four, a living room area with a sleeper couch, a large entertainment center with a flat-screen TV and DVD player, and a balcony (more on that later).  There was a full bath located just off the living room.  The master bedroom included a king bed, a large desk with a flat screen tv, two closets, and a comfortable chair. The master bath was huge - with two double sink stations, a Jacuzzi tub, a shower, and a separate toilet.  It was really nice staying in a large, 1,000-square-foot space, and we took full advantage of the kitchen, making breakfast and lunch most days.  We took an Uber to a nearby (2 miles away) supermarket (Vons) for groceries (they offer free delivery, too).  Our rate with resort fees was about $225\/night - a bargain for such a comfortable and roomy space.  That's the good.
The Bad:  Suite 17608 is not owned or operated by MGM.  It is privately owned and is operated by Las Vegas Suites. This means that if you have a problem, it must be addressed via Las Vegas Suites and not through the MGM Grand.  Housekeeping services are NOT included in the rate, and Expedia did a poor job advising us of that fact when we booked; in fact, we had no idea that it was not included when we booked the suite.  If you want housekeeping, you have to advise Las Vegas Suites and pay $25 per visit - theoretically.  I said theoretically, because we ordered one housekeeping visit and no housekeeper showed up.  (Comically, she showed up the day AFTER we had requested the visit for, and we turned her away.)  We were able to get a refund.  More problematically, we had two maintenance issues with our suite.  The TV in the master bedroom did not work, and the lights in one of the large closets did not function.  We called Las Vegas Suites (on Friday evening when we arrived) and learned that it has no one in the office on weekends.  We did leave a message on Friday and got a call back on Saturday morning from a guy who said he was sending someone right over to fix both problems.  He didn't and did not bother to call with any explanation.  Instead, we were not able to use the TV in the master bedroom until - after calling Las Vegas Suites on Monday - someone from the MGM got it working.  The suite also includes a nice balcony, except that it is COMPLETELY unfurnished - just a cement area with a glass wall - so it really was not particularly usable.  The pool in Tower 1 is pretty nice - although it is very small. Your best bet is to use the pool at Tower 2 which is much larger.  The MGM's pool area - which is composed of three pools and a ""lazy river"" pool - was a bit disappointing.  For the first three days, the lazy river was not open (for no reason), and on the last two days, ONLY the lazy river was open. And when the lazy river was open, the resort ran out of inner tubes before noon - really frustrating because the pool area was not particularly crowded.  The pool area closed at 7 p.m. each day.  So, we were able to use only a fraction of the pool area each day and it closed ridiculously early, which was unexpected for such a huge resort.  Now to the ugly.
The UGLY - and boy, is it ugly:  Suite 17608 in Tower 1 overlooks the MGM Grand's Wet Republic - a night club in a pool.  It was open on Saturday and Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and for the entire time a DJ blasted bass-heavy club music for a group of several hundred early-20-somethings who took up every square foot of the pool and spent the entire time screaming, drinking, dancing, and partying.  See attached photos.  And all of that is fine, except that if you are staying in Tower 1 and face Wet Republic, you can't possibly sleep or hear yourself think over the constant thumping of the bass. And that is if you are indoors with your TV blasting.  If you step outside on your balcony, it sounds as if you are backstage at a Jay-Z concert - it is that loud.  Much worse, if you are staying in the warm season on a Wednesday night, you get to enjoy the same from 8 p.m. until sometime after 2 a.m.",1.0

"Small little club at Phoenix. If you are a lounge club member, this is your only option. Clean. No showers. Limited snacks.  Full bar however AZ state law does not allow you to serve yourself and there is a bar tender. Most lounges allow you to serve yourself. All in all of you have time and you want some chips and a few cocktails its a nice spot. Note there is only one TV so if you're wanting to watch the playoff games and someone else wants NASCAR, first come first serve.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.",1.0
"Atmosphere: Disgusting and not aesthetically pleasing. Lots of vandalized light wood. It smells like dick cheese in here mixed with vomit and under dried towels. I do not understand how this bar continues to exist.

Drinks: I'm 75% sure they use Sprite-type drink in their gin and tonic. They use gigantic glasses of mixer with a single standard shot. We also ordered shots separately and each shot was $2 for 0.5 fl oz. I was stunned. I have not really ventured to campus bars in my three-and-a-half years here because I consistently have bad experiences. 0.5 fl oz for a shot is the next level of low. Most campus bars at least pretend to not be totally lost and call 1 oz a shot... But 0.5 just leaves me speechless. Standard shot, you guys, is 1.5 fl oz. Nowhere else have I seen a recipe for mixed drink with an 8 to 1.5 mixer to liquor ratio. That's basically spiked Sprite. My point is, they have -1000 drink craftsmanship. Which is fine since apparently you're supposed to lower your standards on campus. But what really gets me is that they sell 0.5 oz dribbles of liquor and call it a shot... 

Food: Food service is poor though the food is fairly good. We waited an unusually long time for two burgers. We began to think something was wrong so we peeked into the kitchen (after asking a server and having to wait more) and it looked like the cook was cooking away... And then he ate the food. I get it... If I were working all night I'd get hungry too. But it's kind of strange delaying orders for an absurdly long time so that the cook can prepare and eat food from scratch.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this place since there are very few vegetarian places here in Vegas.  The food is very bland.  I ordered the club and my partner ordered a blt.  They didn't prepare the tofu very well.  No flavor whatsoever.  If it weren't for the pesto and avocado in my sandwich I would feel like I was eating cardboard.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the coconut cake.  So good!  It is probably the only thing I would come for again.

Originally we had a car rental at another company. A day before our trip we came across some reviews and were too scared to bother with them. We heard how amazing Alamo was so we booked a reservation and cancelled the other one. Our entire process from getting off the plane (we didn't have any checked bags) to catching the rental car shuttle and driving away in our new rental car was no more than 40 minutes. At the Alamo center we used the check in kiosk! It was so easy and convenient and the computer won't try to upsell you!!! Such a great experience!,1.0
"I was a customer here for 4 years. The doctors who did my eye exams were always professional and nice, but the people behind the desk and the people (all except one) taking my orders were rude and spoke with an attitude every time I went in. This never bothered me as I'm used to this almost everywhere and was just there to get what I needed and leave. About 2 years ago I was the only customer in there and was looking at glasses. The guy taking orders was giving me dirty looks. Then he went over to a woman at the desk and I heard him whisper (loudly like he wanted me to hear) ""Can you take over for me? I don't want to serve this freakish ugly beast."" Then he went somewhere in back. I was mortified and frozen for a short time. I was way too embarrassed to say anything so I acted like I didn't hear. I continued to look at glasses and maybe 10 minutes later I heard him say loudly, ""Is that tranny gone yet?"" I turned to see him standing in one of the entrance ways to the room. The woman said ""Shh, she's still here."" He looked at me, smirked, then left. Again, I was way too embarrassed and wanted to pretend like everything was fine. I wish I had the courage to acknowledge what was happening, speak up, and put in a complaint about him. Unfortunately, I don't know his name and forgot what he looked like. Otherwise I would do that now because this still bothers me to this day and I'm kicking myself for not doing anything!

"Just moved in July 2, 2015.  Relocated from the Baltimore\/DC area and am thoroughly impressed.  I was able to complete all of the required paperwork and make all of my pre move in payments online prior to my arrival.   When I arrived, I signed two pieces of paperwork and was in my apartment (after a short tour, of course).  I got a really nice, unexpected goodie bag complete with a handwritten welcome note,  bottled water, a cool, Tervis-like cup, popcorn, and magnets. :)
The grounds are gorgeous and the maintenance team takes great care to ensure that they stay that way.  I found a few things that needed repairs or attention during my move in inspection and had maintenance at my door the next morning (there was nothing requiring immediate attention).  Both gentlemen were extremely nice, personable, and got all of the things I listed taken care of quickly and without incident.
The community is gated which is also a nice plus.  You will receive a key fob that grants you access through the vehicle and pedestrian gates, as well as the clubhouse, mail room, pool, and gym. Your guests can look you up at a call box located outside of the gate and the box calls your cell phone so you can grant them gate access.  Convenient!  
Don't be put off by the complex's proximity to the 101. I live in a location in the complex very close to the highway and cannot hear a thing from inside my apartment.  The walkways, paths, and hallways to the apartments are all well lit and I have always felt safe while walking through the complex.  It is also very quiet.  No thumping music or people partying until dawn.  It's surprisingly quite serene!
The mailboxes are located in the clubhouse and is accessible 24 hours a day as well as the gym and bathrooms.  
The pool isn't huge, but is beautiful and has tons of loungers, cabanas, firepits, and misters.  They even have BBQ grills next to the pool and a large eating area (there are additional gas grills and seating set ups strewn throughout the complex too).  I am pretty sure the pool is 24 hours as well, but don't quote me on it.
Keone and the rest of the Seven staff are amazing. I have been going through hell with the company I hired to move my stuff and am basically living with nothing but an air mattress and three changes of clothes.  I had to go into the office to sign another document and was explaining my situation to the staff.  They were ridiculously sympathetic and even offered to lend me pots, pans, and anything else I would need from their own homes.  Fortunately, I have some good friends here who are helping me out until my stuff gets here, but I thought I would add this into my review to show just how compassionate and kind the staff here are.  
A few things you may wish to consider: 1) parking is limited. You are assigned one space under a covered awning. If you have more than one vehicle, the other must park in an uncovered, unassigned guest spot (which can sometimes be difficult to find, especially on weekends).  Unless you live on the third floor, your assigned spot will be nowhere near your apartment.  The majority of the covered parking is on the opposite side of the complex from where I live.  That means hauling groceries quite a distance and making multiple, long trips.   I asked to be moved to a closer spot, but was told that the developers of the complex made the parking plans based on the floor you live on, not the location of your building.  I bought a collapsible wagon and tote my purchases that way, but it really can be a pain.  If there was ANYTHING I would deduct a star for here, that would be it, but I'm not disabled in any way and am really just being fickle (apologies). No stars off because I am admittedly a tad bit lazy and not acclimated to the heat!
 2) Don't park in an assigned spot if it's not yours.  Management does enforce towing. 
3) There are no overhead lights in the bedrooms or living room, so bring lamps! (The kitchen, bathrooms, laundry room, and dining area are all equipped with overhead lights).
4) I can hear the person above me stomping around during the day and can also hear when the shower is on upstairs, but can't hear televisions or voices.  I lived in an atrociously old, loud building in MD prior to moving here, so I am not bothered by this at all, but for someone who isn't used to hearing noise from neighbors or that may be bothered by this, you'd probably want to know. 
5) Every month, you receive a bill with your rent, water, trash, and pest control rolled into one bill (water is on an individual meter, not billed as a building share).  You can pay online with an e-check (free) or by credit card (I think it's a $5.00 convenience fee\/charge).  Electricity is billed by APS and you are required to set that up and show proof to Seven prior to move in.

"First off the customer service representatives here are very good. Xavier was awesome and patient with my multiple issues. Manager Erica was was accommodating but I wouldn't go as far as saying ""friendly"". They were unable to remedy my voicemail issue on the sales floor, so they took my phone to the back to be serviced by a higher level manager. They brought my phone back out after at least a half hour, the problem was not fixed and they had reset my entire phone, managing to erase all my custom settings. They had to call the Verizon help desk and the issue had to be taken care of over the phone anyway. I appreciate Xavier's level of service very much. But the back room technician's decision to reset my phone without asking is pretty unforgivable in my opinion. Oh well I guess. Yay smart phones :-\/",1.0

Came here before a comedy show in the showroom.  It was busy but not packed.  We sat at the bar without a wait.  We were seated for quite awhile without any greeting.  Another couple was seated next to us and the server greeted them and took their order before even acknowledging us.  One of the cooks noticed we were getting irritated and took our drink order.  Finally our waitress came to take our food order and then another customer down the bar yelled for a Dr Pepper so then she left us to get him a refill.  Finally we got to order. I got a cup of clam chowder and combination pan roast and hubby got shrimp scampi.  They brought us the bill before we got our food.  Clam chowder was good but nothing special.  Combo pan roast was a little plain compared to my usual spot.  They didn't ask a spice level like I am used to.  Hubby enjoyed his shrimp scampi. Our drinks were never refilled.  They sat empty most of the meal.  I can see why the guy was yelling down the bar.  No one checked on us once.  Between service and food I'd pass on this place.,1.0

"As my fiancee put it, it's definitely worth 5 stars alongside the 4 $ signs. I took my fiancee here for his birthday celebration. We were going to catch a show, so the only time we would be able to make it was after 9pm. We were promptly seated (yay reservations made through opentable!) and given an amouse-bouche. They even gave us a little low stool for my purse. As we were getting ready to order, we saw that there was an open table near the window and asked if we could be moved. Our server went to ask the manager to see if that could be arranged. We were able to change seats (double yay!) and dined with a view. Unfortunately, we could not partake in the tasting menu because it is not offered after 9 or 930. While we still wanted to try the tasting menu, the selection and quality of the a la carte menu was well beyond our needs.

We ordered the Mosaic of Milk Fed Poularde Foie Gras and Artichoke and Black Truffle Soup appetizers which they offered to split for us. I ordered the half-portion of Wagyu Beef and Lobster entree which was perfectly filling. My fiancee ordered the Crispy French Sea Bass which is a classic dish from Guy Savoy. After ordering, they offered\/recommended to us an unbelievable unlimited complimentary selection of breads to sample during our meal. The server was very attentive and gave us suggestions. Then they provided another amouse-bouche of pea soup with a little surprise under the other half of the small cup. It seemed like the staff was very excited for us to discover the surprise since inquired if we had found it yet (very cute). The surprise under the cup was a delicious and soft heart of palm stuffed with cheese. The appetizers we ordered were perfectly matched with their bread pairings. The entrees were equally if not more amazing. The wagyu was so tender, and the sea bass tasted light and the crispy scales gave it an amazing texture. The earl grey sorbet they give at the end was a great way to finish such a flavor rich dinner. We were stuffed by the end of the meal by their culinary masterpieces.",1.0
"Every time I go to the movies at The Palms, I see an advertisement for Earl of Sandwich.  
I've wanted to try them for a while, but never have.

I had the bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich, and my fella got The Full Montague with horseradish sauce.

My sandwich was good.  Bacon was nice and crispy, the egg was cooked well, and I loved the bread. 

Fella's sandwich was the better of the two.  That horseradish sauce is the best!  I'll order that again, for sure.

"Every spot in the parking lot is spoken for on a sunny cleveland day ! People pull up by the van and truckload to partake of the sweet treats in ECC. Everyday they have a special flavor that you can find out about by visiting their website - but I always like to be surprised. 

They have a wide selection of flavor's and toppings. Today we tried the mayfield road crunch, which had cashews and chocolate shavings, and the caramel sea salt, which was very delicious but I WISH it had chocolate shavings. The texture custard is thick and creamy, no ice crystals to be found. It's not overly sweet either, unless you go crazy with adding toppings.

Upon entering, I was greeted by an older lady with a warm & friendly welcome. She asked if she could help with anything & I told her I was there for a name change on my account.

Anywho, there is only one teller window open, the others have been closed & there are now deposit machines to replace staff. This is a really cool feature, but made me concerned about staffing.

I went here to try the chicken and waffles since I believe that is their specialty. There's nothing special to it to be honest.

"Without question the worst poutine I've ever had. I tried the ""montreal"" which was poutine with smoked meat, mustard and a pickle. 

My poutine was smothered in at least a half cup of mustard. It was so overpowering that I couldn't even taste what little gravy they gave me. The portion of smoked meat was also disappointing. No more than the shavings from a couple small thin pieces of flavorless smoked meat - like the scraps left on your plate after eating a smoked meat sandwich from Caplansky's. The fries were overcooked and very dry too. 

The entire dish was so off putting that I actually tossed it in the trash after only a few bites. 

All this magic in one box for a ridiculous $12 including a can of soda.

"First time I have been here. Friends suggested it for lunch and booked a table as it was Saturday lunch time, glad we did as it was full for food otherwise. 
It was a nice venue with a lot of wood that made it have a very homely natural feel. Seemed to have a slightly older crowd that I was expecting. I thought it would be more hipster than from what I had heard so was pleasantly surprised. 
The menu was quite limited but had enough choice for me. Unfortunately my friend can't eat gluten or dairy and there were very few things she could have. As the menu want marked up we asked the staff what she could have who was happy to give us the low down. Having been told the salad was ok with the sauce on the top she ordered that. When it arrived there was mayonnaise through which was very disappointing. What I would say is that the staff without prompting saw she hadn't really eaten it and asked what was wrong to which she explained, she was offered alternatives but declined and again without prompting they took her good off the bill which was very good of them. It turned what could have been a downer onto the meal into an error that was fixed with no fuss. 
For the rest of us, or food was delicious. The chips where crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside which was perfect. The burger was very tasty, would recommend it if you go. 
Beer selection as you would expect (being owned by Innis and Gunn) was very good. They also serve a selection of sizes so I was able to have a schooner (2\/3 pint) which is a better size for me.

"I just want to echo what the previous review states - these guys are not easy to work with.  My initial visit with Matt, who came to my home and measured my fireplace, was good.  He was friendly and seemed to know what he was talking about.  It was all downhill after that.  I picked out a fireplace insert from the options provided to me by Matt.  For some reason, that insert would not work after all, so I was told to choose from another brand of inserts.  Then, after a month, they came out to install the thing.  The two most unfriendly men showed up for the install.  They yelled for me to come see the work when they were ""done.""  I came in the room to see a cord from the fireplace stretching across the room and a large gap between the top of the insert and the fireplace opening.  I told the guy it was unacceptable and I kid you not, this guy smirked at me as if I just made his day by getting upset.  He said ""I ust get paid to install the insert, I'm not an electrician.""  To address the gap he said, ""someone else comes out to do that.""  That was news to me.  I was under the distinct impression that everything was going to be done that day.  After raising hell with Matt, I was told that the owner would come out to complete the job.  He arrived about a week after and put a faceplate around the insert to cover the gap and after some discussion he wired the insert into the basement instead of just throwing the cord down there and letting me figure it out.  You know, I've run across this a couple times from similar companies in Pittsburgh - it's like there is so much work to go around that they don't' give a crap about customer service.  I want to buy a grill for the backyard in the spring and I have another fireplace upstairs.  There is a reason to do the work properly and with kindness - I could have been repeat business.",1.0

"The only reason I'm writing this review is because their service has definitely declined recently. A few of us went in 45 minutes before Iftar. The two of us that had arrived placed our order and told the server ""please come back when our other two friends arrive to take their order as they are fasting as well"". The other two came after ten minutes and the server was no where to be seen. She never checked up on us even once until one of us had to get up physically and ask them to take the orders. The fact that we had arrived 45 minutes early, yet the server didn't have the courtesy to check back even though we mentioned we were fasting is a bit ridiculous. At this point, two of us received our food and the other two didn't get served until 9:30 HALF AN HOUR AFTER IFTAR EVEN THOUGH WE CAME EARLY???? They didn't even seem apologetic and we literally had to get up two times to say ""hey we're fasting can you guys see where our food is"". The fact that they prestige themselves as a halal restaurant yet they couldn't even offer a glass of water or an appetizer (like other restaurants definitely do if their service is slow (read: bad) was highly disappointing. I've been to a plethora of restaurants in the GTA and I've never felt this way before. I get that it's a lounge and it's meant to be laid back and laissez faire, however, I feel that that should not take away from the professionalism and customer service of the restaurant. In addition, we had like three servers, which isn't what you expect in a ""higher end"" kind of place. It kind of felt like everyone was all over the place and could not care less about the customers. This kind of attitude is okay for the shisha lounge area, but I don't believe it's suitable when you're actually there to dine and sitting in the dining area. At the end of it, we had all paid our bills and didn't receive a receipt - at which point we realized we all paid a lot. Between the four of us we paid around $140, which didn't make sense considering the food and shisha we got. We decided to do the math and realized that we had all been overcharged. At this point, I decided to call them and let them know, but the ""manager"" gave me attitude, instead of being apologetic. We trusted them enough by not asking for a receipt, yet we felt like they exploited us. They charged us 15% gratuity on everyone's bill even though it was four of us - on top of which we also tipped. The biggest issue here is not about the few dollars in change, it's about principle. The server should have at least let us know before charging us for gratuity that is supposed to be charged on five people or more (so the guy on the phone claimed) WE WERE ONLY FOUR. I'm sure the server could count to four lol. On top of that, the service was way below average so we were nice to even give a tip. At any restaurant I've been to, they let you know beforehand about gratuity, instead of just charging you. We weren't even supposed to be charged it.... 

That being said, the shisha was good, so no complaints there. I would only recommend this place for shisha, not for food. The management should really think about creating some sort of an organized structure, instead of being so laid back in their customer service and attention to detail while charging people.",1.0

"Cats. Coffee. Cute everything. Hell yeah.
So this was my first visit to a cat café in general, and I definitely wasn't disappointed.
The whole establishment is vegan which frankly makes a lot of sense to me given the fact that we're all animal lovers here (why do the other cat cafés not have more vegan stuff??). We just grabbed (inexpensive) iced coffees but I'll definitely be back to try other stuff.

In terms of space and atmosphere, it was perfect- there's a cozy inclosed patio space with twinkle lights where the cats seem particularly happy. The inside of the café is adorable with lots of saturated-colour item furniture; great artwork; lots of cat paraphernalia; and soft, ephemeral tunes playing.

The only down side was maybe that there were only four cats in the whole establishment and they're clearly very used to a lot of affection from patrons. Needless to say, for the most part the kitties were not interested in hanging out with us. I reckon this is probably a regular thing for cat cafés. They were still fun to look at though!

One tip that I have to mention is that they do like to close many of their doors 5 minutes before they close. They'll leave one door open until closing so don't let that deceive you!

- By reducing the number of offerings by about 25% they focus on the expensive and delicious things! 
 - Food is HOT! No gimmicky crap like cold or lukewarm food in a mini-skillet!
 - Everything I sampled was superb! The dim sum and pot stickers were served in authentic steamer baskets. The roast turkey wings were to die for. Especially with the portobello sauce with huge hunks of mushrooms.

 - Omelettes made to order! Nothing like a sassy mushroom, spinach and bacon omelette! 

 - The Mexican station had a delicious nopales (cactus) and the most unforgettably scrumptious seafood enchilada I ever tried. Not only HOT but SPICY HOT! SO GOOD! 

 - No stale rolls here! Breads were abundant and the onion rolls were divine.

 - A masterpiece of a desert station with fresh made crepes stuffed with every fresh fruit, berry or sauce you could imagine. REAL whipped cream. The flans were so good I had SIX! And the Molten chocolate cake SMORE cake had me licking my plate!  

 - Table service to clear the plates was unobtrusive and invisible. I scanned the entire place (and this was both visits) and never saw a dirty plate.

 - Immaculate clean bathrooms located right outside the entrance.

"Initial in store experience was ok. Associate was helpful. The rest of the experience, not so much. The chair I bought, when it arrived, looked good but mechanically was unsound. I called a national number as instructed and eventually someone came to look at it. Parts were ordered and someone else came and put in part of the repairs, saying the other part wasn't needed. The chair still has problems. There was never any follow up from the Madison store. VERY dissatisfied.",1.0
"My party of 12 called ahead to get our table reserved. They said it would be ready in 15 minutes. We received a notification via text that our table was ready as we parked. We went to the hostess stand to be greeted by a less than friendly hostess that said it would be 20 minutes. We asked what happened and received no apology nor sincere attempt to accommodate our party. Our large party went elsewhere, their loss! The good news is there are plenty of places within waking distance to compete with below par service of this establishment.",1.0

"I had spent a year going back and forth with no resolution to my swollen optical nerve. DR houchin just requests more tests and when you go to appointments, he doesn't have the results.

"What an amazing and life changing experience for my entire family!!  We love this spa for every reason from the positive, uplifting voice of Heidi (owner) when calling to schedule your appointment to the second you step in the door, throughout your massage and picking your free gift as you leave, it truly has us impressed and always excited to return.  While I know my family loves all of our therapists there, I have one in particular I love and absolutely refer all of my friends and family too.  Her name is Christine Sarner.  She is the first person in my life to take away all of my pain.  I have degenerative disc disease in my entire spine and horrible joint pain with reoccurring dislocations and multiple disc herniation and the list goes on.  In addition to physical pain I suffer from migraines and epilepsy on a daily basis.  For me to have a seizure free day or even just no migraine symptoms for the day like nausea is something I very seldom experience.  Now every time I have seen Christine, my body is lain free and I am so elated to share that she took away my nausea and I was seizure free for a whole 24 hours (possibly longer but I was too busy enjoying life to count).  My family and myself would like to thank her and every one of the team at Angel Blessings for their attentive and rewarding care we receive every time we visit.",1.0
"Very nice consignment store.  Carlos who works here every day is very helpful and was great to work with.  Nice furniture at good prices.  Note that as of September 2015, the map on yelp is incorrect.  The store is in Ahwatukee on 50th street between Ray and chandler.  You can see it from I-10.  It's a little hard to find but well worth it.  Only disappointing thing is that delivery isn't free (even though we only live 4 miles away).  I've shopped at other consignment stores that include delivery anywhere in the valley.",1.0
"I don't know what's going on @ this place, but as an African American I find it to be not very welcoming especially being that  it's in a predominantly black area. I went into the office to inquire about an apartment after speaking with a woman by the name of yasenia who obviously sounded Hispanic and unprofessional. I explained to her that I viewed the place online an wanted to stop by and look at it. Once I arrived at the place the first issue was there wasn't anyone at the front of the office but through the glass windows in the place I saw several people were there sitting doing nothing, but didn't bother to get up and greet me considering there wasn't anyone present upon entering the office. After sitting there for 10 minutes without being acknowledged I decided to leave because if this is the way they treat future residents, I feel sorry for people that are stuck in a lease. Either the company promotes discrimination and hires these type of people, or they need to get rid of all the staff at this place and try again. I will be filing a complaint against this place and want to make others aware of what's going on in this place. How dare them treat me this way! If I could I'd give them zero stars. ******WORST FRONT OFFICE IN LAS VEGAS****",1.0
"Started off with their coffee which was so bland and weak. They only had whole milk and skim milk a subtle for creamer. Already started off bad but I still went on. My staple food is to get sesame bagel with light plain cream cheese. Theirs was so hard, cold, dry, and not pleasant to eat. I've had better bagels and cream cheese at home. It was almost like they had made these bagels a week ago and left it out in he open air to get stale. Not impressed, I left but grabbed OJ juice for someone else. Got home and tasted it: artificial orange flavor with sugar. Lots of sugar. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Better yet go to Einstein or panera.",1.0

"Best. Hair. Ever. Was in and out with my new full set of hair installed and checkout 2 hours flat . These ladies are so nice and professional and will make you feel comfortable and well taken care of . Katy installed my extensions, did a fabulous job I couldn't be happier . I have had this style of extensions before at another salon, but a world of difference between the two. Also, there is no discomfort whatsoever and looks completely natural . I highly recommend AZ Strands to anyone looking for that extra oomph for an extremely reasonable cost and quality you will receive, not to mention the backing they offer for the hair and service.",1.0
"Worst customer service ever.. This place had better be glad they have good prices.. I hate having to come here. They obviously can't handle more than one customer at a time and don't even greet you as you stand around waiting... After standing there waiting for the employee to finish his needless ranting, he completely ignored the fact that I had been the only other customer in the store standing in front of him and began to assist another customer. The other customer told him I was next and he gave her an eye roll. This will probably be my last time shopping here. High Life Smoke shop has 100x better customer service and experience.

I order from various Jimmy John locations regularly and I have never experienced the nonchalant attitude and lack of service that I have with any other location. My initial order was placed online and then I had to call regarding the first error. I had to order my sandwich twice and two times they still did not get it right. I spoke to the manager and of course its someone who is barely a legal adult and just doesn't care about the quality of the service. 
I guess this is what I get for not getting up and just going to a REAL deli. I expected that I could get my simple sandwich order without any issues. I would NOT suggest ordering from this location online. Go in person so that you can absolutely ensure that your order is prepared correctly.

"There are so many things I love about this hotel. First of all, you can go from the front desk to your room without going through the casino. You can easily go from your room to the pool without going through the casino as you pass it on your way. The pool is outstanding! My kids loved the water slide going through the shark tank. Let me say that your child needs to either swim or have floaties as when they land in the water at the end of the slide, it is a bit deep. The drinks are reasonably priced ($7) and the reserved area has a low minimum to sit there ($25). There is a shallow area of the pool with these really cool chairs that are partially in the water. I loved the classic rock music playing poolside and the jacuzzi is nice and hot. Unlike hotels on the strip there is a coffee maker in the room (keurig) so bring your own coffee or you can pay $10 for the 4 provided in your room. Adjacent to Fremont street with its crazy laser light shows and street performers. I would stay here again.

"Very casual restaurant with mostly long communal benches to sit at. This isn't your usual restaurant I never seen a sausage salad on anybody's menu before. This restaurant specializes serving the Cornish Pasty. They offer a multitude of varieties and a long list of vegetarian ones to choose from.

 I ordered the traditional ""Oggie"" pasty. It was a thin crispy crust stuffed with nicely seasoned moist beef, potatoes, onions and rutabagas. It was delicious as it was but when you hit it with the wine gravy then it becomes super delicious!

As delicious as my pasty was I'm glad I stopped eating at half. When I got up I felt full. My waiter was very helpful and efficient and offered me extra sauce to take home with the yummy half I brought home. I don't think it's possible to leave hungry from here.

"Came for restaurant week and loved our meal! Not much to update from my previous review, but we just really enjoyed our meal and especially to desert. I was so stuffed by the time our dessert came, but I still ate it all.


Port terrine: pretty good, I could've used a little more of the mustard. But, that's personal preference, as I love mustard. A good combination of relishes, to accompany the terrine.

Pork belly and scallops: good flavors, again in the sides\/relishes that accompanied the pork belly and the scallops. The pork belly was a little bit on the dryer side, I think it was supposed to be more of a crispy style. But still, yummy and the scallops are cooked very well.

"I occasionally come here because of comps but even given the fact that it's a free meal, I try to avoid this place as much as I can. Food served here is down right disgusting and I can't imagine myself paying to eat at this place.

SERVICE
All they do is take plates away from table. Some are friendly and others won't say a single word but I don't really mind. If anything, they need to work on improving their food quality.  

FOOD
I try to come here for their special days like the seafood day (every Friday) and prime rib\/scampi day (every Saturday) because it seems more worthy. Line is usually anywhere from 20min to 1hr long on these days. NOT WORTH THE WAIT. 

They have different sections. Salad bar, Italian food, Chinese food, Mexican food, questionable food, etc. Nothing looks appealing as it all seems like it's been sitting under the heat lamp for half of the day. Food served here is usually really salty. I came here multiple times in the past few years and have not liked a single thing I had from their heat lamp paradise section.

They also have a section dedicated to desserts. From unhealthy sugar bomb cakes to sugar free options. I like to get their ice milk dessert. It's almost like an ice cream but more milk based. I always get their chocolate ice milk dessert with chocolate chip sprinkles and that usually makes up for the nasty food.

Go for the salads and ice milk dessert. If you have comps, go to Triple 7 Brewery next door or Market Street Cafe inside California hotel. Trust me you don't want to waste your comps here.",1.0

We got up graded at no extra cost. We were given a room with 2 beds, kitchen and living room. The kitchen had a dishwasher, fridge\/freezer and microwave.

"A group of friends and I decided to visit Toby Keith's I Love This bar & Grill for dinner.  We got in without reservations with only a minimal wait at 6:00 on a weeknight in July.  It was a little tricky to find as it was upstairs and around a corner inside of a casino (Harrah's Las Vegas), but after wandering around for a while we finally figured it out.  

The decor is very cutesy country, fitting since the bar's namesake, Toby Keith, is a famous country singer.  The atmosphere alone is worth part of the cost of the meal.  We pushed together a couple of tables and ordered a few drinks.  Now, I should probably warn you, as I WISH someone had warned me, that their drinks are HUGE and come in large mason jars.  Even the adult beverages come in these same jars, and they don't make them weak an watered down, either.  You'll be feeling your liquor by the end of your first one, and I had more than one.  I was drinking one of their signature cocktails called The Patriot. The Patriot consists of Jim Beam Kentucky Bourbon, Southern Comfort, dry vermouth, and sour mix with just a splash of sierra mist on top.   Let me tell you, they go down smooth.  I had a sip of my friend's Georgia Peach (vodka, peach schnapps, and sierra mist, and it wasn't too shabby either.

When it came time to order the entree I decided to go with the BBQ'D rotisserie chicken as it looked like one of the healthiest items on the menu.  For about $18 I got a half chicken slow cooked on a rotisserie to a tender and moist perfection and brushed with a generous helping of barbecue sauce.  It came with a choice of two sides; I chose mixed vegetables and a baked potato.  I asked them to put just cheese and bacon on the potato and put the butter and sour cream on the side. Everything was tasty and while I felt stuffed by the end of the meal, at least I didn't feel like I'd clogged my arteries with grease.  One of my friends even mentioned how tasty my plate looked.

"I recently went there because I absolutely love Mexican food and I am always up for a new restaurant, especially Mexican!

The chips and salsa were really good but as someone said before in their review, they don't really give you a great amount verse other places that I have been before. 

The staff was friendly, but there was a good amount of errors which is completely normal for any new business. With time, they will hopefully get better. 

One thing to note is they do not serve alcohol, so if you are looking for margaritas this isn't the place.

I have no reason not to give this place five stars. I walked in for the first time and sat at the counter. The regulars were sitting there and struck up a conversation with me.

There was a lot of food more than enough for me! The eggs were cooked perfectly! This is definitely a place I will return to. Although it is small I absolutely loved the family feel!,1.0
"This happened earlier today: 

As we approached the door, we saw this employee (short, short red hair, heavyset) arguing with a customer at the door. Apparently the store had just closed but he was asking to make a quick payment. She raised her voice at him and said ""NO! YOU CANNOT MAKE A PAYMENT!! WE ARE CLOSED!!!!"" then as she stepped back inside she stared at my husband and me for a second, slammed the door in all three of our faces then walked to the back of the store shaking her head and saying something to the other employees. 

We're moving out of state and came to the store to return our modem. We called the store at 1:30p to verify the address. Why didn't the employee tell us they close at 2pm? This is how we were treated?! She was incredibly rude and definitely disrespectful. Does she think her attitude will assist in customer retention? The man who she yelled at walked away saying, ""Thanks for the help. I'm switching back to Cox!"" We will be following suit.

The entire experience was the best we could hope for. Our baby girl was able to pass in her bed and in our arms. Dr. Fixler and his assistant took care of everything. Originally, he didn't have an opening for 2 days, but then immediately worked us in. I believe he really understands that pets are part of the family.

"I've tried going to this place multiple times, just to give them the benefit of the doubt. I've decided, I just can't do it anymore. 

One, I'm a female. This seems to have a lot to do with it. Every time I walk in the SAME guy (tall, nerdy, blonde hair, pony tail, skinny) comes up to me and says ""what can I help you with?"" I let him know I'm just browsing and if I have questions I'll let him know. He proceeds to always stAre at me and take offense to my ""just browsing"" comment. (Disclaimer, I'm a total nerd, but don't come off as one. I actually study board games or play them before I decide investing in them. So I don't need help picking a game. I'm just seeing if one I researched catches my eye). Then he proceeds to practically lecture me on how that's what he's here for and this is his job. I tell him I understand and I'll let him know if I need help. My partner was with me the first time and she professed she'd never walk back in there. Just the SECOND time in row two males walk in, this time a Dad and his son. He goes up to them says what can I help you with, they say just browsing and he says ""sounds good, have fun!"" 

Why the bloody hell am I grilled but these MALES aren't? Then I'm questioned when I finally do buy a game as to if I know how to play it, in a completely condescending way. I'm literally appalled.

"Im surprised this place has such a good overall rating. I must say I'll never understand the constant crowd. I grew up on Wayne and have tried eating here out of curiosity. There are several reasons why I think this is the grossest shawarma I have ever had!!! 

1. Yes its a big sandwich..and full. Full of crap that is! Chunks of fat and greasy chicken pieces which happen to be the cheaper chicken cuts. REAL shawarma is made out of breast meat and this is far from it! 

2. Next, if you walk by often enough, you will often get a glimpse of their filthy kitchen in the back when the door is open. You'll see the lack of cleanliness and sometimes even a lack of hygiene in the form of sweaty fore heads. 

3. Also, workers don't wear gloves or hairnets.

5. They have minimal seating...

"If I could review zero stars I would. I have been shopping at this store for 2 years exclusively for everything home related. I remodeled my whole home 10k and after the remodel I decided to purchase new appliances on Black Friday. Their deal said buy more save more so if I purchased 4 appliances I save an additional $200. I did my research for these appliances and went in with everything in hand ready to go. Because the sale was great, several appliances were back ordered but the lady said as they were available, they would ship out and I still qualify for the deal. After purchase, the additional discount never came off so she called the manager Jason to help. He told me because they were shipped on different dates, I didn't qualify. I said the fine print said one receipt and he told me that meant one order. I didn't ask what it meant I said what it said and wanted the sale as advertised. He said he would meet me in the middle and I said no, I'm not negotiating. I wanted the advertised deal as advertised, nothing more, nothing less. He said no, so after an hour and a half I canceled my order and went to lowes. They not only price matched with Home Depot but allowed for military discount (which Home Depot denied) and allowed for delivery as items became available. I will never shop at this Home Depot again and will likely be a lowes customer from now on.",1.0
Great spot in Toronto that always has something going on. You can catch the game or come to one of their many events like trivia night.

Great selection of beers but for a pub they are frequently out of several selections and don't update the ""this is the beer list for today menu."" My daughter went through three on the list before finding one they were not out of. The patio is a great spot with a fire pit etc and will be fantastic in the fall.",1.0
"Bar Buca is one of my go-to spots in Toronto. Although I have tried all three, this is probably my favorite of the Buca dynasty because it's just so versatile. You can come here at any time of the day (or night) whether it be for brunch, coffee, or some glasses of wine. It's refreshing to have a place where you can go for a coffee past six o'clock. It feels very European. The interior is sleek and modern with high ceilings. The food is simple yet elegant. They have a to-go counter as well. They are even open on holidays! 

Some of my all-star favorites:

--Uove Strapazatte: Mixture of turkey, goose and duck eggs with burrata cheese and truffles, topped with basil and served with grilled ciabatta bread. Spectacular.

--Zeppole: Again, incredible fried dough filled with pistachio cream 
--Schiacciatas (stuffed focaccias), especially the porchetta one. 
--Assaggi di Pasticceria: two-tiered pastry tower with various goods such as cannoli siciliani, biscotti alla semolina, torta cioccolatino, pizzelle etc.

"We had the worst first impression and pre-sale customer service with the pre-owned department, specifically salesman Hakeem Bolaji. We made an appointment for a test drive.  We were running early and called ahead to see if we could do the test drive earlier. In the call, I also asked if we could also try a new Honda Fit for comparison. The tone of the conversation immediately changed. Hakeem gave a stern ""No!"" and asked in an aggressive manner the rhetorical question ""How many cars do you want to buy?!"" somehow implying that we're idiots for trying more than one car and comparing. I mentioned that we wanted one car but wanted to try more than one and compare, and added that I thought his question was condescending. He answered ""Well, you don't need to come in and buy from here!"" I hung up at the end of the conversation completely taken back and surprised. Do not come here for pre-owned cars, unless you want to buy more than one car from Hakeem! Horrible customer service.",1.0
They were at the Foodie Fest and there was a line however it was not worth the wait or the price. It costs 16.00 and I was totally prepared to spend. The big disappointment was they were only four bites with no real taste of anything. Not my idea of a SHARK TANK suggestion. I won't suggest it or follow this one. They need to add flavor and more lobster to make this a real delicacy for the asking price.,1.0
"Owner does not warranty work. Had a cracked screen replaced for $100,   a week later phone had a blank screen. When we brought it back in owner said it is a seperate issue that occured after screen was replaced, and there was nothing he would do besides give us a discount on fixing it. Sounds like a shady mechanic to me.",1.0
"With the recent renovations this gym is spectacular. The space is massive and it feels like a big warehouse at 5am.  I like the variety of options for weights, cardio, and classes that you can do at anytime of the day. Add on the fact that it has 24 hours a day access and this place is great. Plenty of parking as well which gives you 0 excuses to not workout.",1.0
"Great service here. My suit coat and pants needed to be tailored and cleaned for upcoming job interviews and they did a great job with everything. I was acknowledged right away when I came in to pick up. There was a little wait because they were helping another customer, but it was fun because everyone was friendly. They also sell jewelry and clothing near the register, so I could browse while I waited.  I had a total of 4 pieces cleaned and altered and all 4 were on point.",1.0
"Not sure why I've never rated McCarran. My parents and I used to go to Vegas ALL the time when I was in middle and high school (so like 1998-2004 or thereabouts). I had a 2-hour layover here today and wasn't too broken up about getting to play some slot machines for a bit :P.

The Southwest terminal has some great eating choices too - I had Nathan's, and there's a pizza place, Wendy's, Popeye's, Jersey Mike's, and more. Yum. The airport is big but is easy to navigate. There are shuttles to get from the ""outside world"" to your gate, as I recall. 

I had an easy layover here today and would recommend it for that or for direct flights.",1.0
"This is a fantastic service.  My cat Louis was in need of a minor surgery and some dental work all of which was performed right outside our building.  The only thing more heartbreaking than seeing your loved one in pain is the agonizing drive to and from a vet office.  This service is humane for both the animal and the owner.  Dr. Gina and her staff are extremely courteous, professional and genuinely compassionate.  I would recommend Valet Vet to anyone.",1.0
"I was in town for a Packers vs Panthers game in Charlotte. Looking for something unique and local to do I came across this place and was very pleased. Short trip from downtown area. Owner gives a great story about how he started and a short history about the industry and where the company is headed. Coconut rum was my favorite. If it's ever in stores in Chicago, I am sure I will buy a bottle. Worth checking out if in Charlotte or nearby.",1.0
"Ever since I went to Irvine spectrum to try their pieology there I was obsessed with the idea of a quick pizza place styled like chipotle where you could just walk right in, pick your toppings and go. Finally we get one for Vegas! I tried their roasted veggie and had the other half styled alfredo. The alfredo had a little too much garlic and wasn't really evenly spread out but was still good, and the roasted veggie was nice and had a little sweetness thanks to the corn on top but I didn't really like how it was a little soggy and watery.. But then again you can't always have perfection. I could tell the worker also was inexperienced as well since she kept looking back and forth at the recipe instructions to see what goes on the pizza we were ordering so that might of also contributed to the unevenly spread of toppings. The flavor was over all pretty good, and the prices are pretty reasonable considering I'd pay the same price at chipotle. If you haven't been yet, I recommend going at least once. They are a newer establishment so I think i'll give them a little more time to get settled in and when they do, Ill probably try it again.",1.0
"I went here a few weeks ago with a friend to grab a couple of drinks, it was the first time for both of us.  

We stopped in on a Thursday night, & I liked that they had live music, but I didn't feel as though they had the best set up for the performer.  

I also liked the fact that they have daily specials, big plus for me when going out to local bars\/restaurants.  

What I didn't care for was the food.  While they have a fairly limited menu to begin with, it was even more limited due to the fact their fryers were 'broken'.  Nearly half of the menu items we weren't able to order so I just ordered the O.G. Grilled cheese sandwich with the house seasoned chips (since fries were not available).  The grilled cheese lacked any gourmet aspect and the house seasoned chips were simply cheap store bought chips and sprinkled with pepper.  Both of which I can probably accomplish in my own kitchen for less than $9.00.

With that said, neither of us will probably head back to this establishment.",1.0

They sell all kinds of drinks and snacks as well as odds and ends you may want for your trip while in Vegas.

We went in after we seen all the other stores were closing, Not sure if this one closes early like the others or if it stays open.
It did seem as if they were getting ready to close because of a couple of women standing in the front as you came in so they may have been closing.

"I really do love the Germans. This chain is spreading fast over there and they're bringing their efficiency and attention to detail with them here. 

Motel One is, as the name suggests, aimed at the budget market. Rates for this venue range from approximately £69\/night up. I booked ahead and appreciated the completely free reservation process with room guaranteed until 6pm on the day of arrival. If you give your credit card details, it's reserved beyond that time.

Location is excellent! If you exit from the Market St side of Waverly and turn right it's maybe 3 minutes away. It would be very hard to have it closer. That also makes it very close to the castle and Princes St. Welcome was warm and check-in easy. The lobby area is pretty small but clean and cosy with sweets, maps etc. There's a bar area down a few steps where they also serve the buffet breakfast each morning.

My room was the cheapest version and was internal, facing onto a courtyard. It had no view and was quite dark, but quiet. Everything was completely spotless. The bathroom was small but well designed and had a great shower. Bed was comfy with 2 single duvets. So continental, don't you know? I appreciated the tea and coffee making facilities (I'm like a beast without them), the decent sized TV and the free wifi. The hanging storage facilities are limited but it was fine for a few days. 

Random: hands down the best hotel hairdryer I have ever used. And one of the best dryers in general-called a Black Mambo. It was worth staying there for that alone. Well, you know, also the really good value and the pristine conditions. But definitely the hairdryer.",1.0
I've been a fan of Tia Rosas and I was thrilled when they opened another shop close by. I love their food and it's certainly 5 star worthy. However I felt the need to drop a few stars because  A) the guy you have serving food is a jerk and B)  I always get the same thing every time and have the last 4 times I've been in. Suddenly today I am charged $1.50 more?? I checked my receipt and it was right but a $1.50 price increase literally overnight?? And $1.99 for a basket of chips is ridiculous. I will still come but probably not as often now. Now I don't think it's worth it.,1.0
I only trust Tiffany doing my eyebrows. I will only go to this place to have my eyebrows done from now on. I am very picky when it comes to how people do them but tiffany has never let me down. I am so grateful that I was able to find a place that suited my needs. Thank You Tiffany!,1.0

"I've finally had the chance to get back to this place and try the full menu. I, unlike others here, am not all that familiar with the chef who runs these restaurants. I will say that my last meal at his fancy and pricey, L'ettoille was pretty terrible, and although I've tried Graze twice, I was not all that impressed. James Beard or not, you have to bring something more impressive to those two places in my opinion. They appear to be resting on well-established reputation than on truly excellent dining experiences. This place, however, I'm in love with, and feel that this is indeed this chef's forte. This restaurant has a local farm to table angle which is unusual for this type of cuisine. 

On the most recent visit we brought a party of four which allowed us to try numerous dishes. The restaurant itself is divided into a casual noodle bar with a view of the hard-working kitchen, and a more formal space with a full Asian-fusion menu with Korean leanings. 

We started with two table snacks, the spiced peanuts and the beef jerky. We were all craving more of the peanuts very quickly. The jerky was delicious and had a nice spicy bite to it. I've had Thai beef jerky at other places and I'd say that this one could be a little less dry. It was delicious though. These were paired with a couple creative craft cocktails that would, on their own, bring me back.

We moved on to:

Kohlrabi Salad - carrots, cherry tomatoes, apples, long beans, shrimp, herbs, peanuts, tamarind sauce

Kohlrabi is a somewhere between a turnip and cabbage and is also known as ""German turnip"" or ""turnip cabbage"". This salad was delicious and had us all scraping up ever last bit of it. One thing that should be noted in the description is that the shrimp are the little dehydrated shrimp that you find in Thailand. They add a nice, salty punch to the salad. This was sort of a creative twist on a Thai green papaya salad.

Next up:

Cheesy Ddeokbokki - rice cake, lap cheong, Bandaged Cheddar, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, crushed egg, kimchi, gochujang

One of the most unusual dishes I've come across in a long time. I'm a huge fan of Pleasant Ridge Reserve cheese so had to see how it was incorporated into this dish. This was a hearty, cheesy tribute to Wisconsin by way of Korea. Really good, and bravo on the creativity shown.

Bibimbap - meats of the day, vegetables, rice, fried egg, ssamjang, served in a hot stone bowl

Perhaps the most recognizable of Korean dishes, Bibimbap is a heated stone bowl filled with rice, veggies, meat, etc. An egg is then cracked over the top and cooks by virtue of the heat of the dish itself. This one was spot on with super fresh ingredients. Delicious. 

Pork Curry - spicy red curry, beans, pickled garlic, crispy shallots

Wonderful, although I did add a bunch more spice using the unique Kim-Kim sauce they keep on hand. I would prefer that they ask how spicy I'd like it. This was too tame for our tastes.

We cooled our mouths with some wonderful homemade soft-serve ice cream in unique flavors like balsamic and basil. 

Service was a bit too casual (as in the waitress didn't know the menu well and was a bit scarce). 

Overall, BRAVO. This one hits it out of the park. When back in Madison, I'm heading right back here.",1.0

"Awww, PTs... Usually this is a solid choice, but apparently not on the night of the college football championships. Maybe they were short staffed, or something, but the night was fraught with errors. 

We waited for quite awhile before our waitress took our drink orders. She brought our beverages (just iced tea and water), and we had to ask for menus. That took awhile longer. I ordered the Bikini Wrap, but with honey mustard instead of ranch, no onions, and sweet potato fries.

The meals came...but with no utensils. We had to hunt her down for those. Mine had regular fries instead of sweet potato fries. We signaled for her, and she apologized and took the plate. It took FOREVER to get the replacement meal, and when I did, the fries were completely overcooked..Almost burned. SIGH.

Ok, so the wrap has to be good, right? Nope. It was FULL of onions, and had the ranch, not the honey mustard I requested. I tried to pick through it, but I was pretty disappointed. Our waitress never came back to check on us.

Another waitress came over to clear our plates and give us the bill. We did mention all of the issues, and to her credit, she took my bikini wrap and the iced tea off of the bill. I'm hoping that it was just an off night, but I was pretty disappointed overall. Le sads...",1.0

"I don't know if I could say it any better than the review posted by poster Kasio M.

I read so many bad reviews and was very leary about staying here. But I had a great time and will be staying here again.
To start off....if you like staying at the Wynn,Bellaigo,Aira ect....you wont be happy here. You expect too much for 70 dollars a night.
If you are looking for a decent place to stay ON the strip (no 20 minute walk from your room to the strip) this is the place to stay. I had a Go Lux with strip view room. Room was clean...bed's were very comfy. Tv in the bathroom mirror was pretty cool. Laying in both beds we could watch the Bellaigo fountains. Maid service was awesome,anything I asked for I got quickly. 

The casino had a great vibe. I was not a big winner but won enough to keep me above my daily spending budget. Drinks were brought much faster than other casinos I played in. I played at the Wynn for almost 2 hours and never saw a cocktail waitress.  I find it funny that the expensive hotels casinos barely  have anyone in there gambling..but hotels like Flamingo...Harrah's...Ballys have ALOT of people in there gambling.

As for the food. I did try the dinner buffet...SO not impressed. I had a better dinner at Circus Circus. I also ate at Ramsys Pub and Grill....Caesars new buffet and the oyster place at Harrahs which are all awesome.

Flamingo was not a let down and I will be back. I say give it a try!!",1.0
"They have no business calling this location fast food. It's 1:30 pm the place is almost empty one person in line in front of me and one table waiting for a messed up order to be fixed. It took about 10 minutes for them to get to the one person in front of me. That person had e ""pre order"" to pick up. Their order was not ready and was 30 minutes late. Luckily the food was cooked and they only had to box it. 5 minutes later they brought that order to the counter and it was wrong. Once fixed it's my turn 20 minute wait for #2 in line. They have a drive through at this location which was backed up too. They only had three viable employees 1 cook, 1 drive through teller and 1 front desk. No clean up, no prep very understaffed.",1.0
"Although this may be the most infamous restaurant in the Valley, our experience could not have been better. The owners, Samy and Amy, were extremely nice and it was great to meet them. My only concern is that because they are now doing everything themselves, they are going to burn out very quickly. 

For dinner we started with Amy's famous flatbread and the artichoke dip which is so filling and delicious it could be a meal in itself. We followed that up with panini sandwiches. I had the provolone and muenster with prosciutto and Lauren had the spicy salami with peppers. Both of our sandwiches were excellent, although as good as the flatbread was, I wish they still served pizzas :-)

Finally, we finished off our meal by splitting a flourless chocolate cake (I don't recall the official name) that was the perfect mix of decadent flavors and moist chocolate cake. 

If you're planning on eating dinner, I highly recommend making reservations because now that Amy, Samy, and one dishwasher \/ busser make up the entirety of the staff they are having to turn away potential customers once they reach a certain number of customers in the restaurant. While some walk-up customers may not like this, it certainly means that the quality of service is ensured for the customers who are already seated.

However, if you just want to stop in for dessert, you can easily do that without a reservation and you will still have a great time.

The night we dined, there was a good crowd and many appeared to be regulars. We will definitely be returning and its a good reminder that there is generally nothing real about ""reality TV"".

"A taco joint that's trying to be something it is not. The idea is there, but the food tastes sub-par, presented poorly and inconsistent. Many times the food is over sauced or spiced. They need to take a few tips from barrio and perfect a few of their proteins and designate a few specialty tacos. 

The crew seems a bit lackadaisical. It's much like the other ""local"" group restaurants. ""Just not good"". I feel that if they concentrate their efforts and make a few menu items great, rather than many items okay, they could have something special. I hope for Willoughby's only mod-mex taco joint to turn around!",1.0
"I didn't want to go because of the name!  But it's a lot nicer than I expected.  Basically a French bistro-style brunch restaurant that also serves sandwiches and coffee.  Impeccably clean and they put white paper on the tables and have crayons for the young-uns.

Their signature item is the chicken pot pie with a side of broccoli casserole.  I cant eat it because of my non-dairy status but that's not their fault.  So I opted for a ham and egg English muffin sammy.  

Hash browns are a new item but it's a little brick that tastes like it came from a box and was not cooked all the way through.  I hope they change it to something more appealing.  

They do have soy milk for coffee which is a plus!  So I would try ""Cluck 'N Cup"" again.  The staff is very friendly and kind enough to answer all my questions as a first-timer.",1.0

"I usually get my salad fix from Earth (formerly known as Toss't) but after reading the reviews here, I decided to give Simple Ingredients a try for lunch today. I was greeted warmly when walked into the little place and I didn't feel rushed as I looked over the menu to decide what I wanted. I was feeling more in the mood for salmon than chicken so I choose the Super Foods Salad with the tomato basil dressing. The people behind the counter were personable and while I my salad was being made, I learned that this place is owned by the same people who own Sal's.

As one other person on here pointed out, there is no seating in Simple Ingredients (part of what makes it so ""simple"" I suppose) so I took my bagged Super Foods Salad to my office and enjoyed it at my desk. My first impression was how fresh everything in the salad tasted. The tomato basil worked well with the spinach, kale and edamame and the serving size was just about right. I was really surprised by the slice of bread that I got with the salad. It seemed stale... very uncharacteristic of the rest of the meal.

It seems to me that there are mainly two salad joints in the Downtown area both competing against one another: Simple Ingredients and Earth. Let me contrast the two. 

Simple Ingredients seems to have slightly fresher produce than Earth does; but only very slightly and maybe I just caught them on a delivery day. Earth on the other hand offers strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, something that I really enjoy with my salad and I kind of missed them today. I think you get a slightly larger serving of salmon and it comes in one piece at Simple Ingredients but I like the way Earth crumbles it up for you. Also, Earth applies and mixes the dressing of your choice for you which is good if you're going to consume the salad shortly after purchasing it. Whereas Simple Ingredients gives you a tub of their dressing and you can apply it when you see fit. Good for those purchasing now for later. 

Both places have their pros and cons but all in all they both produce a very good product and there's enough of a market with the Downtown crowd to support them both.",1.0

There Yelp ad says open 24\/7. That is a lie. Their office closes at 11 so if you need any help with your room, you're out of luck. I had to go to CVS and buy a fan just to keep my kids cool for the night. My 1 year old had an allergic reaction after laying on the couch so I stayed up the whole night with him. I sent a complaint through their website because there was no one in the office. That next morning the manager knocked on the door and gave me attitude for giving them a bad survey. She never offered to fix the issue or move us to a clean room to prove that her hotel was better than that. Instead she said she couldn't refund us for that night but that she won't charge us for the next night ( which is obvious since we were leaving the hotel!) and gave me a free night stay at any other location. When I went to the front office to check out, she was talking about me and my ""expectations for a cheap hotel"" to her employee. This was a manager! When I started to leave she said ""I hope you find what you're looking for"". A clean room for my family to sleep in. That's what I was looking for.

"Jinya is the best ramen shop in town. I've been trying every ramen place in Vegas for the last 10 years. Sora, Monta and Ichiza have been my favorite to date with subtle differences that make each unique and about on par with each other. However, Jinya is on another level completely. Jinya has great ramen and offers a variety of broths that are complex and delicious. Most ramen places offer half a dozen add-ons or less. Jinya has a huge add-on menu (20+ options) for the ramen. They have a decent tapas and basic sushi menu, the brussel sprout tempura is crazy tasty. And they have a legit alcohol menu that has craft beers (stone & ballast point) and even a lychee-tini and  mimosas and some nice wines and sake. The decor is like minimalist contemporary and there's always hip jams playing to create a groovy vibe. There's a small section of bar seating, about a dozen tables and one huge group table that seats about 20. I've tried the vegetable ramen, which had so many vegetables I was kinda overwhelmed in a good way. I've also had the spicy chicken ramen, which was so good I actually said while eating ""goddamn this is good ramen"" like 8 times while I was eating it. I hate giving gushing reviews of places I legitimately like because I don't want them to become more crowded, but Jinya is hands down the best ramen in Vegas. If I could get them to change anything, I wish they offered chicken yakitori as a side. Enjoy.",1.0
"Man, I love Picks so much! When you just need a tasty, salty, beefy experience, they're the ones to go to! This little burger joint is run by a nice Korean couple--they offers k-tacos and kimchi, which you probably won't see elsewhere.

Their burgers are usually a little dry, but not to worry, they offer a bunch of delicious sauces and toppings.  Their fries are always crispy and golden, and so, their poutine is one of my favourites. 

If you're looking for a delicious meal on a budget, go to Picks!",1.0

The patio has rats walking around while you are eating your food. The funny thing is when we asked the waiter he said it's not them it's their neighbours . Will never go back",1.0
"Went here for the grand opening today. The staff were very pleasant and they already know how to recommend the good burgers. Service was very hospitable. You take a number and they bring you the food. They ask if you need anything, provide you with sauces, etc. They ask how you like the burgers. The people are very warm. I wish all fast food places are like this!

The Western thickburger was yummy. The bun wasn't so heavy and a little sweet. I actually think the burgers are a lot better than Holy Chuck's across the street. It's less greasy and actually made well. The meat are tasty. The Western thickburger was really delicious. The veggies were fresh. I also like the High mile burger. It's very simple. Comes with meat, cheese and sauces I think, but the bun made such a big difference. I love their burger buns!

"If you're staying at Treasure Island, don't forget to use your buy 1 entrée get 1 50% off! We forgot to use ours and were so annoyed. In any case, we only came to eat here since we were tired from the flight and didn't want to trek too far for food that night. It wasn't busy on a Thursday night in June, and we didn't need reservations for a party of 6 to be seated right away. However, they are on Opentable, so it's always a safer bet to make reservations anyway, and you get your points! On our visit we tried:

-Shrimp & Avocado Salad (Avocado Stuffed w\/Citrus-Guajillo Shrimp, Corn Relish, Chipotle Aioli, $14.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/seafood-shack-las-vegas?select=yXGp_kvd1cBMGX34ZdgoLw#yXGp_kvd1cBMGX34ZdgoLw): Pretty good, and you get a huge portion for the price. I would actually order this again if you're looking for a healthier option.
-Lobster Cobb (Maine Lobster, Served on Chopped Romaine, Bacon, Hardboiled Egg, Tomato, Spicy Adobo Dressing, $24.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/seafood-shack-las-vegas?select=yXGp_kvd1cBMGX34ZdgoLw#hoA3w0qtY3110U2-Wlmksg): Also a huge portion, and you get a decent amount of lobster. However, I don't think I would pay this much again for a salad.
-Lobster Roll (Celery, Tarragon, Chives, Light Dressing, Toasted Brioche Bun, Served w\/Fries, $24.95, http:\/\/www.yelp.com\/biz_photos\/seafood-shack-las-vegas?select=yXGp_kvd1cBMGX34ZdgoLw#F5wg172qg4YzGOzFhekkHQ): Just ok- I thought this was on the bland side. The fries were pretty good though.

Service was really slow, and it took a while for our server to come by, then a while for our food to come out, then awhile for us to get our check and pay, etc. Unless I was desperate for a place to get a quick meal while staying in TI (and had a coupon), I don't think I would come back.",1.0
"Today after a lengthy discussion with this Petsmart  manager Gauge, I have decided to go forward and write about my grooming \/ nail trim experience.  To begin, I have frequented Petsmart for many years, utilizing the grooming, daycare, purchases in the store and their vet service through Banfield.  Up until a month ago I raved about how wonderful this store was.  About a month ago, this store had management changes.  This is just the beginning of a horrific event.  I have two dogs who frequent this store a few times a week.  Some employees at the store have said that ""my girls"" are the unofficial store mascots.  I have also received many compliments about how well behaved and calm they are.  One dog is 10 and the other 12 1\/2 years old.  They are both in excellent health, with the exception of the older having arthritis in her lower back.  I have had their nails trimmed on a monthly basis and up until last month, I have never had an issue.  I always inform the groomer that the older dog needs extra support under tummy when trimming her hind nails, and the groomer has always done an excellent job.  I had no complaints until last month.  On this day, I brought both girls in early on a Sunday morning.  A groomer named ""Kayla"" took my older dog back to dremel her nails.  I walked through the store with my other dog and I was approximately in the middle of the store when I heard my older dog yelping many times as if she were in pain.  I immediately returned and asked to see my dog.  Kayla returned my dog to me and stated that my dog was ""nasty, mean and out of control"".  My dog was barely able to stand  Her entire hind quarters were shaking.  I immediately walked over to the cash register, showed the employee who was there her condition and asked to see a manager.  The employee at the register stated he had also heard her yelping, and wondered what had been done to her.  This employee knows my dog very well, and was surprised to hear the words this groomer used to describe my dog's behavior.  The assistant manager took down my information, apologized and then stated that I would be hearing from the store manager.  Two days passed, and then I contacted the store and left a message for him to call.  No response.  After two more days I then contacted corporate office.  A few days later, I was then contacted by the grooming salon manager.  I met with her and she basically said this is an excellent groomer and apologized.  I finally did hear from the store manager two weeks after the event  In the meantime, right after the event, I took my dog to be seen by a vet.  She was diagnosed with a sprained hip and was placed on pain medication  I am happy to say that after 4 weeks and many vet visit (over $200 in vet bills) my dog has begun to recover.  I am very lucky to have had this outcome.  What I learned from this experience is that groomers are not licensed or regulated in the state of Arizona.  I have also learned that Petsmart does not value their customers, nor do they care about the safety of their pets.  I also learned after speaking with the vet staff at Banfield, they have treated many dogs that have been injured by this grooming facility.  Because of this experience, I will be moving all of my business to a  local vet, not a huge corporation, and I will be utilizing a small pet store by my home to make further purchases.",1.0
"I was upset that I lived in Montreal because I could not get Chinese egg tarts anymore.  Until I found this place!  The best Chinese bakery in Montreal is definitely Patisserie Harmonie.  The place although small, has a huge selection of buns, sweets and even serves bubble tea and dessert drinks!  They also have a massive selection of cakes baked fresh daily along with single slices if you're looking to party alone!

The service is great here and the employees often tell you about the specials they have in store.  I also have come across many situations in the evenings when I go after work, and the employees just end up giving me free buns because they are closing for the day.  You don't get that kind of service at most Chinese bakeries!

Overall I'm so glad I found this place as they filled that Chinese bakery void in my stomach in Montreal.  I'll keep coming back here, the have great buns!",1.0

We went to Hibachi Grill instead and though it wasn't fabulous, the sushi guy saved the day with freshness and creativity!",1.0
"This place has been around for awhile however I never had a craving for burrito-ish kind of food...but I thought it would be a good alternative since we have tried pretty much everything else in the area. We first went to another burrito place nearby but after seeing the lack of seating\/small place we yelp'd reviews for Burrito Boyz to see what this location was like. We ended up coming here instead for the main reason of more spacious seating. This location has a lot of offerings for meat and non-meat eaters which is great for large groups. No need to worry about anyone getting left out! On my first visit I ordered the steak naked burrito however it was a bit dry due to lack of sauce (my decision). Nachos and water for an extra $2. I have been back here since then, and I have decided that I prefer the panfried fish + shrimp naked burrito. Probably one of my new favourite spots to eat now. Plus the bit of guac is included but if you want more...we'll you know the famous line. ""Guac is extra!"". Ya ya I know guac is always extra. 

The only negative would be the staff can seem a bit stand offish. The music at the front is a bit loud so when you tell them what you want you'll have to SHOUT. Even then they might not hear you, they can give you a bit of attitude for requesting extra veggies too.",1.0
"So please don't take shoes here to be repaired. They may be a great service for dry cleaning (which I can't vouche for), but I did take two pairs of boots to be repaired\/stretched and after two weeks of waiting they were barely stretched and not repaired where I needed them to be. After sending them off again to be fixed, I finally got them back. Repairs are done and stretching is okay - but this entire ordeal was a 3 week process. It definitely should not have taken 3 weeks.",1.0

"I'm so glad that Club Sandwich is in Sharpsburg. Their breakfasts are HUGE, their coffee is hot, and their potatoes are deep fried. They also make an effort to use local whenever possible. The Reuben Hash was delicious and calorie-rific. If you hate carbs this place is not for you. They have a few salads, but honestly it's called Club Sandwich. I'd buy a membership to this club.",1.0
"I came here for chips, four salsas, and a beer. Yep I said four salsas because you must ask for the hottest one. Could of been hotter but it mixed well with the bean dip. The hostess was very polite and conversed well. She was very descriptive of the specials, even told me what the bar specials were too.
I sat down and my server was quickly on me to get my drink! After giving me a few moments, she helped me choose my meal because I couldn't make a decision. We went with the Baja Chop salad, because I'm trying to eat better. But when it came out I could tell it was a high calorie salad. But good though so I ate it of course.

The staff was very attentive and I found them to be very friendly too. I don't come here a lot but I may have to start. Especially for the chips, salsa and Beer!",1.0

"Dayamn these are some good noodles! Went here for lunch with a Chinese friend at work who recommended it. Got the beef with XO spicy sauce and they were delicious. The soups look really good too but I have gotten fried noodles both times. Like most places in Phoenix, the location fucking blows, a strip mall in the sprawl. But that doesn't affect the flavor, which is excellent. Hopefully you can avoid getting served by the moody young girl.",1.0
"Kafeteria is just that. A cafeteria style lunch spot where you grab a tray then make your way to one of the several stations. They have pizza, grilled items, sandwiches, you name it. I usually opt for the sushi or salad bar. They also have a great juice bar, the green smoothie is deeeelicious. They have a pretty expansive seating area, but I usually take mine to go.  It can be a little pricey for lunch, depending on what you get, but I'll pay the extra if I don't have to leave my building!",1.0
"Not the best service! I've been going to these people faithfully for years! A part in my vehicle was broken by them and they fought me about it (almost the whole shop including the ""manager"") saying it wasn't a big deal! Not going back! Not the best way to resolve a situation but, maybe that's their way of talking to people! Not to me though!!",1.0
"Nothing special here. I went with a group. The beef was a little salty, and the breaded chicken parmesean was equally as unimpressive. The breading was soggy and lacked any crispiness. And the dessert was obviously catered from elsewhere, like a local supermarket dessert tray.",1.0

My wife and I waited 4 hours. Watched someone at the front desk joke about how someone was gonna be here a long time because they were at the end of the list.  A real lack of empathy and compassion here.  Finally got in and the Doctor Liu seemed like he was on some kind of gameshow where he needed to get 50 diagnosis' in a minute.  I doubt he even looked at what the nurse wrote up because he completely skipped over note about a possible hang nail we wanted looked at as well.  Find any alternative if possible.",1.0

Suika Sarrada (watermelon salad) was fresh with generous portions of salmon sashimi. It is the perfect summer dish.

Pōkuribu (pork ribs) was very good, with a finger-licking good coating sauce. Presentation was A+, simple elegance.

"Typical HK style cafe right across Markville. 

This place has a huuuge menu. Food is ok la in my opinion. Ordered the curry with pancake which needs more pancake lol and the black pepper beef noodles which had a huge portion!! 

The short haired lady with the bob is pretty rude. When she took back our menus she just threw them onto the table beside us loooool. But the other one is pretty nice so she makes up for it.

"Spend an extra $20 and stay on the strip.

Rooms here are nice, but everything is an upsell. I even asked for a 2nd drinking glass for the bathroom and they wanted to charge. The room only had 1 towel on arrival and after 3 calls and 2 hours, we finally grabbed towels from a cart down the hall. The staff here is rude and unfriendly, but then again after years of Vegas trips for business and pleasure, it has taken a turn that way most places near the strip.

2 times during the stay on the 10th floor the elevators were down for service (so they said) and here come the stairs, not that I don't need to walk off the calories, but twice in 1 trip to go 10 flights of stairs when I am paying $140\/nt to be in the hotel? The floor staff in the casino was rude and the table games don't have a good flow to them. 

The hotel is loud and seems like a fun environment, but truth be told, I spent 90% of my time at other casinos. The Wi-Fi signal in the room is weak and if you are using a smart device like Ipad, it kicks you off a lot.

The gym is average and make sure if you want to use the ""heated pool"", it will be open, unlike the signs that say open, but security saying it's closed.

Overall, the rooms have soft mattresses and overstuffed pillows if you like that sort of thing, this is your place. I have back issues and the mattress was horrible and I couldn't sleep well. The décor is the rooms and spaciousness is awesome, but that only goes so far when it isn't properly stocked and it's uncomfortable to stay there.

If you can find a cheap room here, it's better than some motel, but if the price is close to strip hotels, stay on the strip.",1.0

"I was referred to Vio's Painting by a family member who had recently used him and had a good experience.  We contacted Vio and he got back to us asap.

He came out the next day and quoted us pricing on painting the exterior of our house and the concrete block walls in our yard. We hired him.  

His team started the project promptly. They did several days of prep work including power washing, masking, and basic repairs prior to the paint.

Vio typically stopped by daily to check the work of his painters and see how we were doing.

PROS: 
-Did not take payment until the project was completed and we were happy.
-Very reasonable pricing and no up sell.
-Good quality work and attention to detail.
-Left no mess at the end of the project (good clean work once completed.)
-Relativity quick completion.  

CONS:
-The yard was a HUGE mess during the project. 
-Some of the work he quoted my wife that was to be included his guys didn't want to do until they check with Vio (moving our small metal shed to paint the wall behind it and painting the front door and garage door.)

I had the misfortune recently of using the same funeral home as the mother of the twins and the director informed me that the hospital never told the mom about their careless mistake!

I went there last year after having a breast biopsy that was shooting blood and the idiot nurse was not even capable of starting an IV! She collapsed the veins in my left arm!

We arrived a little before noon and sat around the lobby for 5 hours before we got our room! That is unacceptable service--especially for guests of a wedding party! By the time we got into our room, I was late to the Bachelorette Party which was already on it's way because I had spent 5 hours waiting for my room and wasted 1\/2 a vacation day in a fucking hotel lobby!

The Friday Pool Day Club situation was awful, the frisk-downs made you feel like a criminal, staff was rude and a manager shoulder checked me instead of letting me (the guest) walk by. No apology either, he just kept marching on. Not every guest is interested in your douchey day club, some guests just want to chill by the pool. The $25\/night room fee is a joke. How can you say it's free Wi-Fi when you're charged $25\/night? Room service didn't come around 'til about 5pm or later each night right when we were back in our rooms getting ready for dinner--some days they didn't come at all! And the food and drinks at this casino was mediocre at best. The entire place seemed really mis-managed, had terrible customer service, rude staff, felt cheap--surprising that it's still in business. I've told friends, family and co-workers about our awful experience and will always warn others if they're considering this place.

"MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for local gifts and postage needs! Shop local.

Ever get tired of waiting in line at the main post office? Ever feel like you don't know which postage option fits your needs best? Trying to select the perfect gift for someone and mail it to them\/have it delivered? Search no more, because it's here.

I've visited this gift shop and more on many occasions and have gotten to the know the family who runs the shop. I love that they focus on local businesses and are a family-owned and ran operation. Customer service here is top-notch and Tammy knows many of the customers by name. She can thoughtfully guide any shopper to the perfect gift for any occasion, for any age, anywhere you need to send it.

What's more is she often features local authors and local artists in her shop! I've stopped in to mail a package (no line and no wait) and saw a local author reading their work aloud to several customers. I wish I had time to stay and meet him because this was fascinating to have such an event at a non-blockbuster bookstore.

But back to the postage - one time, Tammy even helped me stuff my items into an envelop to save on postage. And I love knowing that every package (even items not from her store) and letter I mail supports a local business! I appreciate that often I'm the only customer in line to mail a package and I have all the options (bells and whistles) of the main post office. I've even come here to get holiday stamps when the main branches were out or still waiting for delivery.

How are the gift baskets? They're great. I've used Tammy's services to the full extent in asking her to design a ""Arizona"" specific basket for visiting guests. It was affordable, colorful, bigger than I imagined, and met every one of my needs. For instance, I mentioned that anything in the basket had to fit in a carry on bag and Tammy made that happen. What was more - my visitor absolutely loved the basket and kept going through the items (mug, brownie bites, post cards, etc).

"Dr. B was the best first vet experience I could have had with my baby Bella.  I somehow wish he could be my doctor. No, really. He has everything I look for in a doctor. The office is extremely clean and well taken care of. Upon entering the room, I love the personalization with my baby Bella's name on the screen. She felt like a celebrity. 

The front desk staff is friendly and nice. The best thing about him is his patience and he listens. I swear I had 100 questions written down and he was so patient and answered every single question thoroughly. If only my doctor would do that. He took his time and I think we spent almost 2 hours in total together. It felt like I could talk to him forever, he was so easy to talk to. I loved that he had a powerpoint to go over everything we were talking about so I can pay attention. Great for visual learners and this was very professional.

I hope I feel this way every time I go there and my second visit was shorter but just as nice of an experience. I had less questions. :)

I felt that we were well taken care of first time puppy parents. 

On a side note, by little pup barked her head off nonstop and all staff members were extremely calm and nice about it. Not one person seemed annoyed or anything by it. That really felt good because I tend to get stressed when by fur baby barks and they all remained calm. She was in the hands of many staff members being carried like a baby by the end of the session.

"I'm writing to share an unpleasant experience with ACE store in Cornelius, NC. Having recently relocated to the area I immediately sought out independent businesses to do my shopping. In my experience I like to support local and generally find that I receive a higher level of customer service even though I may pay a little more than the big box stores. I purchased a fountain\/water feature and they agreed to deliver it to my home. I was unaware at the time that delivery ended at my driveway! They informed me that company policy prohibited them from moving it any closer to the home. Important to note that my patio, where the fountain was going, was only 10' from where they dropped it. Yes 10' yet they refused to move it any further. When I went back to the store the manager assured me that he would have his moving guys call me the next day and come back out to move it the additional 10'. Not only did I not get a call from the movers but received a call from an ACE employee informing me that they would not move it any further and if I wanted to have it moved they could give me the name of a company that moves fountains!! This is truly a poor reflection on the ACE brand when a store manager blatantly lies to a customer about his intentions.

"I saw referred to Dr. Michael after my complete blood count (CBC) results came out a bit weird.  He is both very intelligent and has an excellent bedside manner.  He knew the exact right additional blood tests to run on me, as well as explained *why* we were doing each and what the results might mean.  He quickly got back to me on the results, and explained them indepth, as well as a treatment plan.  I highly recommend him!

"All Vietnamese restaurants serve pho of course, but not many also do bánh cuon (Vietnamese steamed rice rolls). My sister complains that the bánh cuon served around little East Chinatown are disappointing shit. In the search for a local restaurant that can live up to what we were used to at home, the mechanical fairies of Yelp suggested this place as one with promising potential. After all, it's in its business name.

Among the small Viet enclave along St. Clair, Banh Cuon Pho Ga is one of a handful of restaurants packed with old neighbourhood faces hanging out for a weekend meal and chat here. So typically dingy, unassuming and basic hole-in-the-wall-looking for a typical Viet diner (like so many others on the block), and empty tables seemed to have missed the attention of a complete post-meal wipedown. It seems also that you get more service attention the closer you sit to the open kitchen, because I had to haul my own ass to hand over our order sheet or to pay. They do get a lot of takeout orders though. 

But in terms of food, they keep it simple--a short menu compared to most other Vietnamese places that give you a gazillion ways of serving pho. And damn cheap too. All pho $6, and them banh cuon start at $4--four!--for the most basic kind with ground pork.

The rolls come in sets of four, which is enough to be filling or be like a large appetizer. It's decent but I find the skin to be rather thick and bland. The shrimp cupcake though were delicious--a good mix of soft and crispy.

Can't speak about anything else they make here. Though for me to haul ass this far for pho is a big stretch. Keep this place in mind should one ever be this far in St. Clair West. And yes, cash only.

I Love this restaurant it is so delicious!  The people there are super nice. We always get Kung Pou chicken and broccoli and beef. We also get chicken fried rice and egg drop soup. We ordered our food and when we went to pick it up they let us know that they put in a free thing of egg drop soup because it was raining outside. We were very happy that they did that for their costumers. When we got home we thought it would be a little thing of egg drop soup and it was a huge thing of egg drop soup which was a surprise. Everything tasted amazing.,1.0

"This review is for their service center.  

In 2014, a little over a year ago, I inherited a 2005 Touareg from my kind parents.  As a side effect, I also inherited the maintenance costs of the Touareg as well.  

AutoNation successfully changed my alternator and some belt related to the alternator, I believe, at a reasonable price (for a VW and a dealer).  I'd also had them do a few other repairs that came up, such as replacing one of the headlamps (which the manual strongly recommends not doing yourself, since they contain Xenon gas or something like that).  All of this stuff went just fine with them, warranting a 4 if not 5 star review.  

However, my most recent visit with them left me feeling very uneasy.  I had a warning light on that said there was an airbag fault.  When I brought it in to them, they told me that I had to do a $1000+ repair to fix the issue.  Their claim was that a component under the seat needed to be replaced, which is not totally out of the question, as this model did have a manufacturer recall within a year or two of building the car (so 2006-2007), to replace an airbag-related part under the seat.  However, 2 claims that they made on this visit did not correspond with my understanding of the Touareg nor with reality.  
(1) They claimed it would take over 5 hours of labor to remove the driver side seat (which is required to replace that component, if it needed to be replaced).  This seemed incorrect, since in previous work done when the battery was replaced (the battery is under the seat), 1 hour of work was billed.  So, even if that component needed replacement, trying to bill 5+ hours of labor seemed dishonest to me.  
(2) I asked ""Are you sure it needs replacement?  A VW person I spoke with said airbag faults can be reset in the ODB-2 and if the warning doesn't come back, you're going to be fine.  If it does, then of course you need to take action.""  They insisted ""Without a doubt, its going to come back anyway, so may as well just fix it now.""  Since $1000 is not chump change to me, I decided to go with my instincts and find out.  What I found was that, several months down the line, the issue has not resurfaced.  

The other thing I didn't like was how the rep tried to pressure me with fear of how dangerous driving without an airbag would be.  ""I'd hate it if you got into an accident and it was more serious because we didn't fix this.""  Yeah, of course, and so would I.  She mentioned it several times in a ""sales-y"" way, which honestly did not really correspond to my past experience with them.  

So, I still gave these guys 3 stars, because my previous work with them had been reasonable -- I'd realistically put it at 2.5 if we could give half stars.  But I didn't like feeling lied to.  

I know everyone makes mistakes, but a $1000 suggested repair that ended up not being actually a relevant issue at all, is kinda a big deal.  I'd like to keep using AutoNation, since they're a bit closer to me, and I was already comfortable using them, but its already been over 24 hours since I called them to try and come up with a reasonable compromise to make up for the last service they did for me without a call back, so I now have an appointment with Findlay to look at the current issues I'm having with the car.",1.0

"This was the lodging provided by the company for us during the husbeast's summit. I really thought that we'd be put together, since you know.. we're a corporation. But we were scattered through out the hotel. 

We were placed on the 20th floor, which apparently entitled us to something that the lower floors didn't get... turn down service. I checked with friends who were on the 8th floor and they didn't get that from house keeping, but we got it every night, and the first time, it scared the husbeast - he tends to be a touch paranoid- not that I blame him. 

Our room was nice, if plain, there was nothing terribly breathtaking about it. We over looked the interstate and the construction work being done at New York, New York. It didn't bother us at all, as we barely heard anything - barely noticed the construction as we weren't in the rooms much during the day.  The bed was quite comfortable, but the toilet ran all the time. I think it acted like white noise for us, blocking out the extraneous sounds at night.

"My company caters from Maggiano's every year on our of our busiest days. This was my 1st year ordering for our department and they weren't able to find the order from last year as a reference. I tried to order what I thought was the same thing, but the bill came out to over $2,000 more than what we had paid last year. After seeing the amount, I called back and spoke to another person, who actually helped us last year. After a couple of minutes, he was able to find our order and confirm what was different about it. He was very helpful and we were able to get things taken care of.

As I said earlier, we have been catering with Maggiano's for years... at least the past 4 years since I have been with my company. This year, we catered in food for over 450 people and the delivery charge was over $700! I understand the delivery charge, but $700? We called a competitor when we were thinking about cancelling their order and they charged $50 per delivery, which is much more reasonable!  They have never offered us a discount or taken off the delivery charge, which is upsetting since we spend at least $6,000 a year.

"What a nightmare. I have been coming to this vet for many years. Decades in fact. We always had Dr V and never had issues. Then a few years back when Dr V wasn't available, Dr Wilson started seeing my fur babies. I was never fully comfortable with Dr Wilson from the start. He always rushes through exams and if I ask a question about anything he then right away suggests some type of service that costs an obscene amount of money and let me tell you, he gets very dramatic in the face like it's a life threatening issue even if it's just a simple nail trimming that I'm asking for. I'm very familiar with what a nail trimming is at this point and I am certain it's not as dramatic or costly as he makes it out to be. Though if you bring your fur baby here it very well could turn out much worse since Dr Wilson is careless with animals. 

On 8\/16\/15 I brought my dog, Brownie in for routine shots. Dr V was the one who saw her on this day and I was glad because he's great about taking the time to answer any and all of my questions. I was concerned about a growth inside her mouth on her gum-line. She needed her teeth cleaned anyway, so Dr V said while she was under he could remove the growth from her mouth. He went over the cost with me and was very upfront and honest. I had questions about a spot on her paw and Dr V said it was just a callus and would be a waste of time and money to remove as well it could cause her problems walking if she had a surgery that she didn't absolutely need. It seriously wasn't even noticeable, I as her mom knew it how it got there and just wanted to make sure it wouldn't be a problem later on. We left happy campers.

I returned on 8\/28\/15 so Brownie could have her teeth cleaned and growth removed from her mouth. That is all I scheduled and wanted. I gave our name and Linda said ""oh I have Brownie checked in already"" so I'm like huh? She had the files switched with another appointment or something. I specifically said ""I hope you preform the right procedures on my baby and not on another"" and she said she has trouble remembering names and faces which was just odd because if it's scheduled and I say who I am it shouldn't be difficult. When we were taken back to a room I was bummed to see Dr Wilson there and hearing he would be preforming the procedure since we were more familiar with Dr V, but I trusted everything would be fine. Dr Wilson didn't even know why Brownie was there and asked us to tell him. I was surprised he wouldn't have looked at her file or known what he had scheduled as far as surgeries for the day. When Dr V walks into the room he talks right away about what we are there for. Dr Wilson was very pushy like I experienced before and right away trying to say that she needed all this other stuff done. I as well my husband was very verbally clear that we did not want these procedures and only wanted her teeth cleaned and growth in mouth removed. He said OK and to come back and pick her up after 1 pm.

I came to pick up my dog and the girl tells me the total cost so I say ""absolutely not"" because WTF ended up costing almost $600 when I was told it would be at most $250? She then tells me Dr Wilson did several surgeries! WTF again? He did surgery on her paw and leg without my permission and it wasn't even necessary! I only cared about seeing my baby and how she was doing so I demanded they bring her to me. The girls working up front have always been flaky (Linda the most) and lack customer service and when they brought Brownie out it was no different. They were telling this girl not to give me my dog until I paid. I flung that door open so fast and grabbed my baby from the girl and she actually was playing tug-o-war with me, but I WON! Never mess with this mama! After hearing Dr Wilson cut into my dogs paw, when I first saw her it appeared her bandage was seeping blood, but it was a camouflage bandage with red coloring on it, again WTF?! Not cool at all to use a bandage that looks like that. I said I had no intent of leaving without paying what I rightfully owed, but I would not pay for Dr Wilson and his careless other acts. Suddenly Dr Wilson came out said I would only have to pay for the dental procedures and tried to blame Dr V when he wasn't even there that day! Dr Wilson took no blame and as far as I am concerned should never be allowed to work with animals.

I have since switched vets and couldn't be more happier where we are now. If you are going to bring your fur baby here, make sure it's with Dr V or not at all. This vet isn't up to date as far as modern day stuff and do not have the equipment to do most procedures like others have.

"Last Saturday I had the pleasure of going to Maki My Way with friends. It was nice to be greeted by a friendly owner who told us why he had opened this restaurant.  This is a great place for take out or eat in quickly. It was nice to know that I could customize my sushi, my way. Although I did not opt to do this, I liked that I had that option. Another plus was that the restaurant was clean and bright, very inviting.

We had a ton of laughs and had a great night. No friendships were destroyed at our table, but I can't say the same for the table beside us who decided to play the worst game of all time: Monopoly.

"I found Paradise Med Spa while next door to the Barber Shop called The Manor. After my hair cut while i was chilling by the fire, a friendly staff member next door come over to speak to me about a broken blood vessel i had on my face that Joel the barber and i talked about. I mentioned that i have wanted to get that fixed for a long time and Janet went over my options on how to laser treat it. I didn't know much about the treatment and she went into great detail on the safety procedure and how the owner, a doctor, has researched, studied and preformed hundreds of these painless techniques. I set up an appointment and they went to work.

I felt relaxed as Melissa and Janet worked together to isolate and zap the broken capillary. They also reduced the redness around my cheeks and evened out my face tone. In no time i was in and out. A pleasant experience. Professional and Experienced.",1.0

"So, I haven't been to many children's museums since I don't have kids, but Children's Museum of Phoenix is the best children's museum I have ever been to.  

I was visiting my Godkids (age 2 and 3) for the weekend and the eldest wanted to take me to the ""choorens moosum.""  Their family has a membership and it is a frequent respite from the outdoor play during that blazing Phoenix summer.  They loved running around and showing me all their favorite rooms and exhibits.  We made macaroni and cheese in the kitchen, ran through the noodle forest, raced cars, and ""got our hair wet"" laying down in the flying bathtub.  

I believe the general admission cost is $11, with several different options for memberships depending on how many people you would like to include (from 1 to a family of 8). 

Located in an old elementary school, the Children's Museum is very clean and modern.  There are several different rooms on 3 different levels - including a mock kitchen, grocery store, race cars, tricycles, noodle forest, huge climbing gym complete with flying bathtub and more.  It is a great way for young ones to burn off energy while being creative with learning.  You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into some of the exhibits that takes into account learning levels and ages.  For example, in the kitchen, children can create their own pizza, complete with baking it in the mock stone oven and serving it to parents sitting at a booth or table.  Our 2 and 3 year old opted to pretend to fill up a pot with water, throw in some different textured fabric strips, stir, and present us with a bowl of said fabric.  However, there were older kids placing their aprons on, creating elaborate pizzas with the same color or texture fabric strips, taking it to the oven to ""cook"" and then cleaning their plates in the sink after.  It was intriguing to see all the creativity that each child exhibited differently.  There are several workers around watching, to make sure rules are followed (no purses or bags on the climbing gym), cleaning up forgotten toys, as well as making sure that all of the items that are supposed to stay in a room, stay.  Although, don't forget to watch your own little ones - it can get a bit busy and chaotic.

I would definitely consider a membership if I had kids and lived in the area.  Even a few hours every few weeks would be worth it!",1.0

If you're looking for a property manager. Rich Hoey is your man hands down. He gets thing done and takes away the headaches from the property owners. 
 If you're a renter looking to rent form Active Renter. Please remember this is a business. Just like renting from an apartment there will be a lease and different deposits. Just like any other business. Unless your renting directly from home owners. This protects the owner and that's why we hire them.  

The complaints I see are from renters. Some of you forget that the owners are vested in these property's. We depend on the rent as our income. You don't pay your rent, I may not be able to pay my mortgage on the property.  My properties are my retirement. I really don't want to lose then to someone that wants to not pay.
I've hired Active Renter to take away these headaches, so I don't have to do credit checks. Deal with AC problems, or leaky sinks or collecting the rent. That's why I hire Active Renter to do these things for me.

This is our 2nd  favorite sushi place in the city. It's quiet, intimate, and has has very modern Japanese decor. Their AYCE is a good price and they don't pressure you to eat fast, we actually showed up like 2 hours before closing so I was expecting them to rush us out but they were really relaxed. Everything was very fresh and there were some pretty unique rolls. Really the only reason I'm giving it a 4 is because they're not open late enough.

"When considering the generally ""bro"" like nature of most of the 'Phoenix hot spots,' The Attic is a breathe of fresh air when looking at their attention to fine craft beer and artisanal, gastro-style selections.

The Attic has the best burger in the greater Phoenix area that I've had.

Close in regards to other great burger spots in the area, but what set the Attic apart was a fine attention to detail in patty flavor, consistency, and freshness and less about adding flare to cover up a bland patty. It was juicy, buttery, meaty, and had the perfect consistency for a medium well patty.

The craft beer selection (unlike the other ""craft beer bars"" in the area) had balls and didn't focus on the general low ABV wheat beers with fruit added that Phoenix is known for.

Complete with bold selections from a triple IPA from Founders brewery and an Horchata Imperial stout from Elevation, the Attic has 21 taps filled with rarities and craft-tastic options.

"The food is tasty. I'd have to say I used to be a big fan of their idli and sambar, however, their standards have slipped a bit in the last little while. i ordered the chilly idli and I expected it to be more spicy as per its name. Unfortunately, the sauce seemed more sweet and reminded me of tomato sauce.

Luckily, I ordered the paneer masala dosa which helped with my craving for spice. 

My biggest pet peeve is the service. The staff are nice but it doesn't seem like you can ever get their attention and getting napkins is a struggle. This becomes a real issue during buffet hours when you're trying to get a dosa as the wait staff are MIA.

"As a local, not a visitor I expect a certain level of service. After all I could become a regular client. I took my girlfriend there on 5\/9\/15 for her birthday.

We could have rubbed oil on one each other and did a better job and saved the money!   Their male\/female steam room was filthy and even hours after leaving to go to the pool it was still not cleaned up.  Used towels laying all over the place and empty water bottles littering the room.

While I'm waiting I see the people in the back playing around (bad sign number 3) and I know it happens I do it myself with my co-workers but there was not one person in there before or after me so they could have waited. My food was actually ready in those 2 mins ( bad sign number 4). I go home which btw is right down the street so the fact that I opened this thing and the sandwich was super soggy made me a bit angry. It was also mess which is sometimes expected of a Philly but nonetheless disheartening. I take my first bite and there are so many things wrong man. The bread tasted rubbery and the meat was absolutely disgusting and flavorless, AND the wiz they used was thin.

"This is one of my favorite late lunch spots in Montreal. However, I mention late because this place is very busy and the wait list is long! No reservations. 
The interior is welcoming and cozy.

For beverages, you must try their home made lemonade, it is simply delicious and refreshing.  Their mocha coffee is very good too. For meals, my favorite is The Cubain, it's porc and pancetta with a Gruyere cheese. In the fall, their Mac N Cheese is very good too. I personally also love a side of their green salad - it has a distinct taste that at first I was not so crazy about but it has grown on me since then and I love it! And, a must try at the end of your meal to complete everything is their brownie - so moist and simply to die for! 

Prices are pricey but well worth it on a gorgeous day! (About $50-$60 for 2 people for lunch.)",1.0
"$50 for 2 adults, 1 child

I'll start with the good.  The service is very friendly and attentive, especially for a burger joint.  This place would be a notch above a fast food burger joint and a notch below an Applebees type restaurant, as far service and ambiance goes.  Our 6 year old enjoyed the decor and was immediately greeted with some crayons and a coloring\/activity piece of paper. Our server (yes they have actual servers here) came over promptly to ask about apps and drinks.  She was friendly and patient throughout our dinner and offered suggestions.

Ok, the other side.  50 bucks for a family of 3 at a burger joint is ridiculous.  RIDICULOUS.  A soft drink cost $2.69 + tax. The burgers go for $7-$12 to start, and then cheese is 50 cents, and there are many free toppings to choose from and a handful of additional costs toppings.  So you're really looking at $9-$15 and up for a burger.  That's a lot of money for a casual burger joint.  

So my burger.... I ordered it medium and it was cooked properly.  I asked for garlic and S&P seasonings.  I couldn't taste the seasonings at all.  You really need some type of salt on burger meat to bring out the fat and flavor.  The sauce I added was a dab in the middle of the bun, not spread on the bun.  So the first few bites have no sauce, then you suddenly get too much at once.  The beef had a decent flavor, but without the salt, it wasn't memorable.  Over all, it wasn't a bad burger, but definitely not the asking price.  The other burger we ordered had sauteed shrooms and onions and it was pretty good. 

I think the overall turn off is the high price for this meal.  I honestly feel it was worth half that, at most.  I hope they improve on the preparation and prices.",1.0
"One of the best roast ducks in markham. The tofu is great too, although a bit pricier than other places, they fry it to order, so its pretty worth it. 

The woman who cuts the meat is a bit weird. Never acknowledges people. Never speeds up when there is a line, which I respect. The one thing that drives me nuts is, she makes multiple chops to make the same cuts, which leaves bone pieces. Usually the technique is to make one strong chop to avoid shattering bone, but she just does her own thing.",1.0
"It serves its purpose as a trendy, upscale sushi joint. If you're in the mood for that type of environment, it fills the void for that immediate area. It's a social type place that is good for groups, in fact, it was almost entirely filled with other large groups around happy hour.  The HH selection is pretty decent and eclectic (which includes select rolls, starters, and alcohol) and I always appreciate restaurants that have happy hour until 7. One gripe is the small size of the cocktails, ug!

What I tried was not life changing and you're paying for the environment. However, anything in that location (including the now closed Taco Haus), is better than the sub-par Mexican restaurant that operated there for a couple of decades. Everyone in my group was pleased overall. The shopping center is a bit ""hit or miss"" and spotty so time will tell if this will be here to stay. I'd rather be eating at Pure Sushi, but due to its proximity, I'm sure I'll return for happy hour and further explore the menu.

"Being Lebanese myself, its very hard to find authentic and GOOD tasting Mediterranean food, especially Lebanese. I stopped by and grabbed one chicken shawarma sandwich along with one falafel sandwich (I was hungry). The first thing I noticed was how much the owners reminded me of my own parents. This is literally a ""mom and pops"" shop, as real as it gets. 

The chicken shawarma was one of the BEST I've had. Flavourful, juicy, clean cut chicken, and you can tell the veggies were fresh, and not in the fridge from the day before. The garlic shawarma sauce was heavenly. Make sure you ask for a bit extra, I like to get one on the side for dipping. (Id also recommend asking for a few fries on the shawarma, that's how its done in Lebanon)

As for the Falafel, this was my major concern. Ive tried Falafel in over 10 restaurants and it was a shame to see how poorly made it was each time. Ive had it all from microwaved and soggy, to fried and undercooked. I was AMAZED by how delicious the falafel was! I found out after complimenting the owner that he is famous for his Falafel. It was perfectly crispy, cooked all the way through, and is literally the best falafel I have ever had.

After being called and approached by 2 men for hitting their ball on our green we called the manager. They were very agressive and even at one point attempted to hit us with their golf ball. Due to them being ""regulars"" they felt untouchable. Which proved to be accurate... The manager, after speaking to the men that angrily rushed to him before we did said ""that's not like them, they weren't even drinking "".  As he heard these men tellinng us girls to meet them in the parking lot. 

I'm all for a cheap beautiful course. I am not ok with being called vulgar names and being threatened by ""regulars"" that pay $10!!!

"No Bueno! The food is super expensive and not eatable, the service is mediocre.

I ordered the salmon Spinach salad was no good. The fish was cooked rare, just the way I like it, but the the spinach was drenched in a pool of salad dressing and soggy. It was a puddle of green mud, and the dressing was sticky and too sugary. Also ordered 4 of the Kogi tacos and they were ok in flavor but Kogi beef is suppose to be big pieces of beef marinated with Korean BBQ sauce, not a puddle of shredded dry beef strings.

"Extremely disappointing. We made the mistake of going on a Sunday in the middle of summer. The park was packed, and there was some kind of party with very loud dance music and an obnoxious DJ spouting inane commentary into his mic. In addition, the parking was poorly signposted and I got a ticket for parking in a no parking area, along with a dozen other cars, right next to the designated parking area.

"ENVIRONMENT
Located off the main floor of the Hard Rock, this restaurant is easy to find and surprisingly large. There's both indoor and outdoor seating, which is practically pool side. Most seats have a view of the pool area, which is great for people watching. 

Came here around brunch time on Sunday with no wait and lots of open seats.

"Came here for dinner tonight. I had the Crab-Stuffed Lobster, and my fiancé had the osso bucco. My food was pretty good -- the lobster was a little chewy and the crabmeat was more shreds than chunks, but it was still pretty tasty. His osso bucco, however, was out of this world.

We also shared the clams casino, which I highly recommend. 

The restaurant was definitely more alive outside on a summer night than inside. You could watch people go by on the street and it was nice. Just right.

Service was very attentive and pleasant and upbeat. We had to wait a little before ordering, but after that there was no lull at all. They refilled glasses and took away played at just the right pace. It was really great service.

Overall, I think the lobster could have used some work, but it was a pleasant and rather luxurious experience. I'm glad we came here. I'll be back.",1.0

"The hostess Jocelyn (small woman with heavy makeup) was horrible to deal with. There are two sides of the dining area and one side had a large rowdy party and a smaller louder party and there were dirty napkins everywhere on the table and much of the table trash was also on the floor. We had my two year old daughter with us and she led us to a booth directly adjacent to the large party. How were we supposed to fit the high chair between us and the adjacent table? Also, the seats were ripped. And when I asked her to move to the other side of the dining room she rolled her eyes at me and brought us one table away. Not what I asked for. Our waiter, Dorian, was great and he finally moved us to the opposite side without the attitude and of course we heard the two hostesses complaining very loudly about us not wanting to sit on that side of the dining room. This was during the end of the lunch hour (around 2:00) and the place wasn't very full although both sides of the dining area had smaller parties. I think this location should revamp their hostess' attitudes and clean up as the one side also smelled like a dirty diaper. The food came quickly and we were given a good amount of attention by our waiter.",1.0
"I'm conflicted about this Chick-fil-A location in the overstreet mall.  On one hand, if you are working and need a quick fix for breakfast\/lunch\/snack or whatever... it's pretty convenient.  But on the other hand, I kind of wish this space was occupied by a small mom & pop place unique to the overstreet mall.

A lot of times I walk by and the line during lunch is ridiculous....probably due to the influx of folks during lunch hour and a shortage of ""fast"" lunch places that are within a reasonable walking radius to his\/her office buildings.

All of the above, being said.  The ladies and gentlemen that work behind the counters are super nice and you can see some of them have a good report with the ""regulars.""  The food is standard Chick-fil-A and its comforting to know it is there when you need it.

"Great locals hangout and open 24\/7. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner and numerous daily specials to select from.
We had breakfast this morning and the service was really good. I had the chicken fried chicken, eggs, toast and sweet potato tots.
Lana had steak and eggs. Everything was prepared promptly and fresh. Only slight drawback was the breading on my chicken fried chicken was a little overly salty and Lana said her steak lacked seasoning, so one item over salted and one item under seasoned, but still a great place for breakfast. We've dined here many times when it was Timbers and it was good and now as Village Pub it's even better. The fish and chips are a standard and the BBQ Ribs is something we'll try sometime soon.
Kind of an out of the way location, but try it out. It's never over crowded and the service is very good.
The man today in the black Chef's coat, Jon was a great host! He really cared about your comfort and was always checking on us.
Check out the specials on the blackboard it has some great values. Also happy hour 11pm to 3 am and 3pm to 6pm daily. Prices are great, but the happy hour prices makes it even better.

The kohlrabi salad was delicious! As a vegetarian, it was nearly impossible to get a veggie entree. Yes, they offer one, but when you are at a table of all vegetarians, that means you ALL get the same dish. Sigh.

My favorite side dish is the vinegarette based sweet potato salad.  Speaking of sweet, I dare you to walk by the dessert case without at least drooling on your chin.

"My first review since I've been MIA and I have to say this isn't my favorite Korean BBQ AYCE. I've been to better ones near Chinatown where it's a tad bit pricier; however, quality was much better than GEN. GEN's looks may be nice but isn't really matched up for the type of restaurant they are hosting. 
1) GEN's interior design is sadly better than the food. The food is dry, not well marinated, oily in some cases, small portioned, and monotoned. 
2) There's no sprinklers in the ceilings so what happens if a Wanna-be-chef (like me) can't cook right and accidentally 'overcooks' their food and a catastrophe happened. Yes, I saw a fire extinguisher but it's far from being reached and being reasonably safe. 
3) The overhead hood that collects the smoke wasn't present and should be on top of the grill. While I was eating, I was inhaling smoke like crazy and got sicker and sicker the more I stayed. I know some veteran restaurants have vents above grills to collect the smoke and suck it up instead of spreading around the restaurant. 
4) Service was okay. Their communication was on point. Once me and my partner ordered more we got it in less than a minute because they use smart tablets to send it up to the kitchen. Now that's clever way of being precise and fast for the customers. 
5) So many grill changes and it was driving me crazy. Of course I'm cooking more food yet they have the audacity to ask me if I want a grill change. The other restaurant automatically does it for us because why would we cook our food on a burnt grill? Common sense. Yes it's nice to ask but do it in a way where you have to change it rather than wanting a customer to keep a burnt grill where the burner is still running. 

I would personally not be back here. They don't accept discover cards (sorry folks). They don't give you forks (unless they have some in stock- sorry for those who can't use chopsticks for their life (like me)). And the prices for drinks is higher than most restaurants and they do not have HOT WATER for hot tea. They only have soda and iced water. I can see potential in this restaurant but that's in the future. They're still in their opening phase and I can't blame them. But for the meantime, I'll keep this restaurant on my low priorty list.",1.0
"We started taking our dog for grooming there just to try out.  It was right beside one of our favourite gelato places (Love Gelato).

One thing we didn't like about pet smart is that there is so many groomers and you might not know who is going to be cleaning your dog each time.  This place just has the two ladies there, I'm guessing they are the owners.  We know that each time our dog get groom it's going to be consistent results, which so far it has been.  They always give us suggests as to what looks good and what to look for when we groom him at home.  And they lets us know how our dog was behaving, he's still a puppy so he's not always patient but they let us know his improvements and what we can do at home to get him to behave better.",1.0

The employee that did my nails was very nice, but she was very sloppy. She kept clipping my skin when she cut my nails. She painted one nail and said to put my hand under the UV light. This took FOREVER, causing my session to take twice as long. Last night I noticed a bubble on a few nails; picking it caused the entire sheet of polish to lift right off. Normally this would destroy my nails but my nails looks like there was never any color whatsoever on them. Very disappointing to pay $32 plus tip for gel nails to last less than 5 days!

"A mall is a mall is a mall. Well, not exactly.
There are malls and then there are MALLS.
This has to be classified in the group of malls that are MALLS in all caps!
First and foremost is the divinely decadent opportunity to have your car parked for you. Only the rich and pampered usually have this opportunity.
Secondly, the choice of shops\/stores is definitely upscale and offers a wide variety of choices.
Thirdly, the food court is tasteful and there are a number of alternative choices of places to eat.
Fourthly, they have a Starbucks.
Fifthly, (can you have a fifthly?) it is air-conditioned and this is Arizona.
At the present time, Spring 2015, the mall is undergoing a fairly major renovation and expansion. This should not impact your shopping experience, but it does add some mystery to the future of the mall.

"Vegans, take note: This is an unexpected gem. Their vegan rueben is incredible! Just make sure you ask for it without cheese. This is where I take off one star. You should not have to specify, when ordering an item marked ""vegan"" that you actually mean vegan. The default should be to make the sandwich vegan, and maybe ask if you'd like cheese to be added. I've definitely made it through nearly half a sandwich before noticing the weird texture that turned out to be tasteless cheese. This is the most perplexing part - it doesn't even add any flavour!

It's also shocking to me that this salon is even certified to use hairdreams. Seeing as though their staff doesn't know how to apply them properly. 
I went to Jen for a cut, color and nano hairdreams (extensions)
The color of my extensions was not matched properly from the start. Then, her ""blending"" my hair with the extensions was nothing more then an absolute disgrace. When I went back the next day to have her fix the color and the cut. She tried to get me to leave the salon with purple hair. Yes, purple hair! Due to the toner she used not washing out completely. Then telling me that "" it'll come out in a few washes."" As if i was supposed to deal with it myself until it washed out. After I insisted that I wasn't going anywhere until the purple was gone, she then agreed to wash my hair again. After that, she attempted to blend my hair yet once again. To which she failed, miserably. 
After I left, They still didn't blend properly and when I got home I also realized that the color still did not match!!!
Shortly after I had to go to a completely different  salon and get my hair fixed properly. Spending yet another small fortune on doing so. (Btw, Going to Kelly Cardenas and getting this BS service cost me a little less then $2000)
The only thing that they couldn't fix is how high she started my extensions. I have very fine hair and Jen put them in just a little below the top of my head. I can not wear my hair up or parted to the side due to them being seen if I do so.

I was charged $55 which was $10 extra for ""matting"" when my dog had one knot in his tail that I couldn't brush out. I was under the impression that my dog was going to be bathed and groomed and I was going to pick him up looking clean, smelling nice, and have the haircut I asked for. I have taken my dog to a lot of groomers and they have never once complained that he wouldn't sit still or they couldn't finish cutting him because of any issue. This lady was full of excuses and didn't even finish my dog or bathe him. I paid her $60 for a job I could have done myself. His cut is choppy and uneven, she messed up his ears, and didn't even get the knot out of his tail. I can tell my poor dog didn't have the best experience there either as he was not his usual happy self after getting groomed he seemed a bit scared and wanted to get out of there asap.

The fish tacos were very, very good. They came with a side of black beans, and what a tasty side they turned out to be!

 I just found Authentic Ethio on Grubhub, and had to call to confirm that they delivered because I just didn't believe it! Haha. As a vegan with no car, you get pretty sick of the same two delivery options (zpizza or Siu Wok) month after month, so I was just ecstatic and in disbelief that authentic Ethiopian food was truly going to arrive at my door! The owner answered and was such a pleasant person to talk to. So helpful, informative, and genuinely sounded happy to be doing this. .

So...I pretty much wanted to try everything that I could get my gluttonous veggie hands on. I ordered a 3 side and 4 side combo to share with my boyfriend (who is quite the picky eater). The owner said it would be about $21 with the delivery fee, and I thought that was incredibly reasonable for the beast amount of food I ordered, lol.  He also informed me it would take about an hour, and I was more than happy to wait for this glorious bounty. He was at my door in almost exactly that time! I hand him my cash and he hands me the goods, and man, it had some girth too it. I knew I was getting bang for my buck. So, I get inside, open up the containers, and marvel at the beautiful feast I'm about to take part in.

There was also a beet and potato dish, (I love beets, and they were cooked perfectly), a string bean dish (yummy with the lentils), a stewed cabbage side (was great for adding texture to every bite, plus I just like cabbage), and slow-cooked chopped collards (slightly bitter, but in that good way that collards are!). All of it just went so well together and now I'm obsessed and hope this place sticks around for the rest of my days on this earth! 

Btw! My boyfriend, who is neither vegan, nor a connoisseur of other cultures foods, actually really enjoyed the split lentils and split peas with the injera bread and ate about half of the serving. That's really saying something because his diet consists of burgers, carne asada burritos, and jimmy john's ham and provolone subs. No joke. He rarely strays!

It's a non conventional mom and pop shop. Looks new and cozy inside. Service is excellent. Tried their beef broth noodle soup. It's very flavorful. You get to choose your own soup base and toppings. Vietnamese coffee is a must try. Freshly roasted and brewed! I highly recommend this restaurant.,1.0

Had them come out for a plumbing leak from my warranty company . They were true professionals and only took a few minutes to diagnose the issue.

"This is my go-to spot for a nice late night bite to eat with the bf. Love their food, our go-to dishes would be the grilled pork belly and kim-chi soup. It is a small restaurant so there is usually always a wait. They offer outdoor seating with space heaters during the winter, which is nice.",1.0
"Ok so this was my first time here, it was just my son and I. When I tell you the manager watched me with a smug look on his face. My child was very quiet and respectful. The waitress even commended me on how well behaved he was. The manager acted as if I was going to steal pancakes!!! I asked for him after my meal. I asked him was there any problem??  I told him you watched my 3 year old and I the whole time at least you could of smiled and said hello, as you did with your other customers. Basically he didnt care for my color. I will always kill such ignorance with kindness. I just wanted to make him aware of how uncomfortable he made me feel.  I didnt even eat the food. You cant eat while someone is watching you in that manner.  Still no Hello or smile. My waitress was nice. Food was bland and eggs were burnt.",1.0
"Tapas 51 is a hidden gem. We were starving after a fun day at Carowinds and looking for a healthy option nearby. We definitely did not expect the incredible, affordable culinary creations we feasted upon at Tapas 51.

The Chorizo Brussels sprouts and the sweet corn were also fantastic.

"I absolutely LOVE this Chandler location. The staff is so amazing, The design specialists are top notch and visual team is superb.  The store always looks fresh, clean and inviting.  I find the best time to go is in the morning through out  mid day until around 6pm. any day of the week. The ""In store"" designers are there and can pull together any style of vignette you are looking for. Sometimes it is frustrating when something I want is out of stock or can only be purchased online , but again, the staff try their very best to accommodate you the best they can.   I also LOVE the Pottery Barn credit card !! Everyone should have one!  You get 10% back on every purchase and all kinds of fun little perks throughout the year.  I love all Pottery Barns in general, but the Chandler location is my ""go to store"" if I want top notch customer service and attention. I live equal distance between the Scottsdale location and the Chandler location and I always choose Chandler.

"Came here with a large group of other Yelpers the other night, after some of us had a dessert craving after dinner (ME). This place is kind of hidden in an alley off of Main Street, but it's there if you look closely.

We kind of took over the entire joint, since the place is on the smaller side with just a few small tables. Good for couples, but less comfortable for groups of 10 or more - we made due though, since we didn't really mind blocking the entrance way haha. 

They didn't have the largest selection of gelato I've seen, but had a decent amount of choices. The large size went for $7, and allowed a choice of 3 flavours. I went with hazelnut (or ""nocciola"" as the more well-traveled Teresa C informed me), mint chocolate, and coffee. While I didn't quite enjoy the coffee flavour, the hazelnut and mint chocolate were about as good as I've had elsewhere. The serving size could be a bit bigger.

"WARNING fellow Yelpers! The 4 star rating is very deceptive. If you have ever read any of my previous reviews you know I don't pull any punches. I tell it just the way it is. They served me a rotten smelly piece of yellowing NY strip steak with my breakfast. Had it removed and replaced with rotten smelly sausage links and patties. The gravy for the biscuits had the same stench as the rotten meat. I think they used the juice from the putrid meat to flavor the gravy. The odor was so bad it was triggering our gag reflexes continuously! Absolutely disgusting and ruined our appetite completely. Hoping to salvage some of the food, I scraped my remaining food onto the toast plate so it would not be contaminated by the smelly steak juice. It didn't help! My son could not finish his breakfast either! They did remove the steak from the bill but charged for the smelly sausage. Total for this garbage was over $20. We were both wondering why there were numerous full plates of food on various tables but no customers were seated there. I think after one whiff they just up and left. Good for them...saved a trip to the ER! The busser would quickly scoop them up as they left. After we gave the busser our unfinished plates of garbage you could still detect the smell of rotten meat. YUCK!

They had some specials going, and I'm not positive if it was a happy hour special or just a special for the event, but they have $4 mimosas, peach bellinis, and bloody marys!  The drinks were great.  Like I said, they were very strong, especially for being so cheap.

I also ordered the Philly Cheese steak sliders, which were delicious! The bun was soft, but wasn't soggy.  There were a few peppers, and tons of cheese.  The meat was tender and flavorful.

"Items Selected:
Crusty Grilled Bread and Olive Oil
Milos Special - thinly sliced, lightly fried zucchini and eggplant with tzatziki and Kefalograviera Cheese
Greek Meze Plate - Tarama, Tzatziki, Htipiti, Manouri Cheese, Olives, Cherry Tomatoes
Grilled Octopus - Charcoal Broiled

Karidopita - Walnut Cake with Kaimaki Tree Sap Ice Cream

Located in The Cosmopolitan, and offering a lunch deal long-hailed as one of the best in the city, it was finally on Saturday afternoon that I sat down at a posh four-top in the center of Estiatorio Milos and with both old friends and new gathered 'round telling stories of food and travel one only wonders why it had taken so long to finally stop by.

Formally decorated, with white tablecloths and good cutlery surrounded by an airy Mediterranean theme with balconies overlooking The Strip, it was after a small mistake at the hostess podium that seats were located and although service seemed stretched and perfunctory due to the noon-time crunch the three course format plus one supplement proved timely in presentation - each plate arriving with precise plating and appropriately temperatured, the pasta particularly notable as it was served still-steaming hot.

Beginning with crusty bread and fresh-pressed olive oil rich with grassy funk, it would not be long before Milos Signature appetizer would arrive and although seemingly nothing special in its ingredients the crispy layers of eggplant and zucchini were simply irresistible surrounding a core of tangy  tzatziki while four pockets of lightly battered Kefalograviera proved a significant upgrade on any other local 'fried cheese.'

With three of us opting for the $10 upgrade Octopus at course two while the fourth instead invested in Meze, suffice it to say that this is one place where the upgrade is well warranted and with each bite of charred cephalopod tender beneath the blackened grill marks both onions and capers served to compliment, rather than overwhelm - a rarity for both ingredients, the olive oil infused with their flavors immediately commanding more crusty bread.

Again biting on the upgrade, this time $15 to put a whole lobster atop the aforementioned house-made noodles, it would prove impossible to find fault in either the portion or flavor of the tender crustacean's flesh and although simple grilled fish generally is not my thing, the Mediterranean bass was also exquisitely prepared while shrimp were unfortunately overcooked and overwhelmed by sauce, the large-grain cous-cous instead stealing the spotlight on a friend's plate.

To this point more than a little impressed by Milos' cuisine, though a bit off-put by a frequently empty water glass, dessert was a simple decision between three options and with two opting for tangy Greek yogurt draped in fruit myself and one other opted for the dainty walnut cake, itself texturally compelling and just-sweet-enough while the mint tinged ice cream proved a pleasant juxtaposition in flavor despite a texture slightly marred by some sort of binding agent or gum.

Undoubtedly a lunch bargain, particularly given its location and dinner time price, Estiatorio Milos is one of the rare places where refined food can still be found for lunch on Las Vegas Boulevard - a veritable steal for the $25.15 three-course prix-fixe price (excluding upgrades) in pleasant environs that feels miles away from Sin City or the Casino floor.",1.0

"American hotdog with a unique Korean\/Hawaiian\/Japanese\/Vietnamese twist. It's located in one of my favorite plaza on Ft.Apache and Sahara. 

SERVICE 
Fast and prompt. 

FOOD
They have a unique variety of hotdogs that you won't find anywhere else. Hotdogs are $6-7 but pretty small so I would recommend that you order their classic French fries or fried pickles on the side. Or two hotdogs.

Euro Special Fries: My personal favorite! I always get this when I visit Buldogis. It's a regular French fries with pork belly, cheese, herb and garlic mayo. Fries are super crispy, pork belly is seasoned well (although it is on the saltier side) and I love their creamy garlic mayo that's drizzled on the fries. Huge portion as well. 5\/5

Buckeye Dog: Pork belly bacon, corn relish, cheddar and garlic mayo. Flavor was similar to Euro Fries, but corn added some sweetness. 3\/5

Hawaiian Dog: Pork belly, pineapple salsa, g-onions and honey dijon mustard. It was like they added Mexican twist because of salsa but then added Hawaiian touch with pineapple. Overall, too much going on for me. I prefer Buckeye over this one. 2\/5

CONCLUSION
I think the weiner they use in hotdogs are too salty to begin with. Then they add sauce and other things which makes it overwhelming. I will just stick with their Euro Fries from now on.",1.0
"One late night I was watching an episode of Million Dollar Critic which is a food show hosted by Giles Coren and one of the restaurants he tried was a Pakistani restaurant named King Place. He gave it a thumbs up, so I thought I would try it out. I have passed by the restaurant and never really noticed it because it's probably located in one of the worst neighbourhoods in the city but guess what, the food is authentic and pretty good.

So I decided on the beef nihari ($10.99 plus tax) which is essentially slow cooked beef and one of the national dishes of Pakistan. The combo came with beef nihari, a salad, pop and two butter naan breads. The beef nihari was tender and delicious and the the sauce was rich and vibrant with all the variety of spices used ranging from cardamon, cinnamon and a few others. It was spicy but not too spicy at least for me. The freshly made butter naan bread was delicious. I also ordered a combo of beef nihari with rice ($10.99 plus tax) to go for my close friend who is Pakistani to see what he thought. He gave it the thumbs up and mentioned it was close to what he has had back home.

If you are looking for good authentic Pakistani fare at a reasonable price, definitely give this place a shot. It's not in the best neighbourhood in the city and the restaurant decor is nothing to write home about but the food is pretty good and it's authentic Pakistani cuisine.",1.0
"First time I visited 9Baci, was for a friends 30th birthday. With a large group of 15, we sat in 2 different spots due to last minute reservation changes. The wait for food seemed longer than unusual, especially since I ordered a thin crust pizza which shouldn't take more than 2 minutes in a wood burning oven. The waiter seemed overwhelmed, and was sweating profusely. However, he recognized they were slow due to large groups on Saturday evenings, and apologized for the wait on our drinks & food. He kindly brought some bread and oil to tie us down. 

Atmosphere: Spacious & modern. Fit for all ages!
Cleanliness: Clean!
Constructive criticism: N\/A
Cuisine: Italian
Facilities: I did not venture.
Food: Good quality, freshness and aroma. The first time I came here, I had the Nduja pizza. I loved it so much, I came back the next weekend with the boyfriend and ordered it again! My boyfriend and I ordered the ""Cesare Salad"" to start. Warm bits of pancetta made it to the salad. The flavor was excellent. Not like any other Cesar salad I've tried. The dressing was generously applied with shaven layers of parmesan and the portion was large! I ordered the Nduja pizza again, only this time, I asked for extra nduja ($2.50). For those who dont know what Nduja is, its a spicy, spreadable pork sausage from Calabria, Italy. It is typically made with parts of the pig such as the shoulder, belly and jowl, as well as tripe, roasted peppers and a mixture of spices. 
Not a fair amount was applied. I was expecting it to be generously covered with nduja. 
The fior di latte which was on my pizza was excellent, warm and gooey.
My boyfriend ordered the ""Melenzane & Soppressata"" pizza. He liked it, but said it lacked a bit of flavor and that mine was better and will definitely be ordering it next time. So yes, there will be a next time! Especially since we didn't get to try desert we were so stuffed!
Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, will recommend! I didn't realize there was a hot table at this restaurant, until after walking out and seeing it on the brochure!
Parking: Private
Portion Sizes: average to large. 
Price: fair. 1 salad, 2 pizzas, 3 glasses of wine $70.63 with taxes.
Service: We were greeted at the door in under 1 minute by a warm welcome. This was my second back to back Saturday coming here. Many large parties seem to be a trend on the weekends. Our server Frank, was not pushy with the specials. He was friendly and warm.
Selection: typical Italian menu, however something that makes 9Baci different is there calzone items which is rare these days, I wouldn't mind trying one. They even have Nutella pizza! Also their options for gluten free dough is great!

"I came here with my friend today for all you can eat lunch. We don't love all you can eat as we find the quality is much better when it's not, but we were really hungry and talked about doing this for a while.

Originally, we had our hearts set on trying kaka in Markham which recently opened but we found out they didn't do AYCE lunch. We were at Vaughan Mills so we were just gonna head east to Yoshiko at Bathurst and Steeles (my personal fave) but decided to give a new local place a try :)---big regret!

I was kind of unimpressed right off the bat from the menu, I know AYCE lunch menus have less on them than dinner but I just felt like it was lacking something! Very limited side dishes. They did have red tuna rolls though which I haven't seen on many all you can eat lunch menus.

Normally when I go for sushi I order a ridiculous amount of food because I just want everything. In this case, there were only a few things I was even willing to eat.

The miso soup came first, watered down!! So was the thousand island dressing they used in their green salad. 

My friend ordered a nestea (which costed $1.50 extra) we saw the nestea cans but made bets that they'd bring it in a cup- bingo!! They did, and it was watered down. He asked for an actual can and the waitress just walked away to get it, didn't even reply- busted! I ended up sipping on his watered down drink for the rest of the meal.

The rolls were nothing to write home about- I consider myself a dynamite roll connoisseur and this one had the most miniscule amount of shrimp I've ever seen, the spicy tuna was meh, and the California was meh. My friend really didn't like his sushi pizza and I wasn't crazy about my beef teriyaki- too thick pieces and very peppery! Oh and the best part, he tried to order spicy chicken- it was literally chicken pieces cut up and soaked in like Sriracha, totally could have made that at home and saved myself $15 lol!

At the end we decided to wash down our joke of a meal with ice cream but realized they didn't even have dessert on the lunch menu! (it was one of those check off menus) my friend asked the waitress about it and she handed him a small check off menu- all I could think was what the hell, if he didn't ask they would not have offered this- then I thought of all the poor people who never got any dessert with their lunch because they didn't think to ask!!

The dessert is the only thing I give them props for because they brought the ice cream and fried banana AT THE SAME TIME!! Bless.

I really feel bad writing bad reviews but I'm about to get to the best part..

The bills came and my friend and I both had a charge for pop on our bills even though he was the only one that ordered one. They tried to charge me for sipping on his watered down mess! No thank you! They tried to argue it but there was no way in hell I was paying for that- heck if I wanted to order a pop I'd take a diet coke over Nestea anyway!

I usually am very generous with tips but didn't tip amazingly for obvious reasons.

Will NOT go back. Anyone who gave 5 stars either had a completely different experience or does not go for sushi and appreciate it nearly as much as me!!

Beautiful chandeliers & a separated bar\/restaurant area. We ate at the bar & first ordered the Crab\/Spinach dip. Unfortunately, we didn't enjoy that particular dish, WAY too fishy in taste, as if the crab hadn't been prepared correctly. However, we then tried the cheese platter to go with the amazing bottle of wine we ordered, and it did not disappoint! A very nice array of cheeses, grapes, & nuts.

"I used to live in The Tuk ( Ahwatukee) and missed Nello's. The tomato cheese bread was as good as I remembered. We got a side marinara to dip it in and it is well worth the side charge for it.

I got a medium it was so juicy and delicious and for my toppings I chose bacon, sautéed mushrooms, and their homemade mozzarella cheese. It was fantastic! The fries were not the hottest temp so they loose some zing, but that happens everywhere. The food runner dropped a cup of ketchup and it landed in the lap of the guest across from me. Some hit my shirt and there was a little bit tension but we laughed it off because the food was delicious. The tiramisu was good. I like it soggier but they are consistent.

The only bad part. After the ketchup incident hitting over 66% of the people at the table no one came by to see if we were OK or ask if they could do anything for us.

I did try some of the Cherry Crepes which were good. The whipped cream on the side was horrifically delicious, like you know there's so much fat in it but you can't help but scoop it up. 

On to the bad part, our waiter was so grumpy and short with us! There were 12 of us girls, so maybe he felt overwhelmed? Still, no excuse for that, especially because we were not a demanding group by any means. 

The other bummer was the Pain Au Chocolat, this is a French restaurant with crazy good reviews about their Pain Au Chocolat! It was dry and bland, there's no way it was freshly made that day. I've had better pastries from the grocery store bakery. Very disappointing.

"Had the most wonderful, idyllic, brunch here at MoRoCo and I am so sad that I don't live in Toronto, or, surely, I would be back every week!

After wandering down the absolutely charming Yorkville Avenue, we found MoRoCo tucked back off the street, in a quiet courtyard.  Greeted by friendly and helpful staff, we were seated out on the patio, which was perfect for enjoying the nice afternoon and people watching.  I honestly cannot explain just how quaint and charming this place was; I literally felt like I was in a dream, soaking up the sun, chatting with friendly people, eating brunch on a Sunday afternoon.

We couldn't even begin to decide what we wanted to order, so we asked our waitress...who promptly took our menus away from us, jokingly (so we wouldn't confuse ourselves any more than we already had, looking at all of the options), and helped us make our final choices.  

When our food arrived it was presented perfectly and it tasted WONDERFUL!  The staff was attentive, followed up to see how everything was, and refilled our water multiple times.  It was an absolutely perfect experience.

I would say MoRoCo is an absolute MUST VISIT in Toronto.  If\/when I am back in town I will definitely be coming back!",1.0

"A friend of mine raved about the salads at this place and took me to a Vegas location for my fist dining experience. I quickly joined the fan club, and was very excited to find a Cafe Rio near my Avondale hotel. 

You order at the counter from a menu offering salads, burritos, tostadas, enchiladas, quesadillas, nachos, and soup. The best part is that they hand make their own soft flour and multi grain tortillas! I was able to watch a woman make them while I ordered. I always opt for the salad with a large soft flour tortilla draped in the bottom of the bowl. Toppings include a choice of meats, beans and rice, fresh pico, cheese, cilantro, strips of tortilla chips, sour cream, guacamole, and limes. I love the creamy tomatilla dressing, it's almost ranch like! So good! 

The salads are served as a very large portion for just under $9. For a smaller, slightly less expensive option, I have ordered the tostada, which comes in the smaller bowl with a smaller tortilla in the bottom. They run the tortilla, and rice and beans through the oven really quick, but the tortilla remains soft and fresh, and you're able to add all the same toppings the salads have. 

Cafe Rio does not have any locations where I live, but I now find myself going out of my way to eat there when I find one in the city I'm visiting. I have only tried the salads, but the fresh tortillas, toppings, and dressing is enough to keep me coming back and leaving happy!",1.0

"This review is based off selling my items to Plato's Closet. I had a pleasant experience in the store today, thanks to a red headed woman (did not get names) & the staff on duty. All were polite, swift, & helpful. I recommend coming in the morning, close to opening time, as wait times get longer (like, hours) as the day goes. I went to Panera for breakfast while I waited, which only took 25 mins. Out of the 30 items I brought in, they took 6, to my surprise. For my hardly worn JUNK LOL! I received $18 in exchange, which can be paid out in cash or store credit of equal value, unlike BX. They told me the rest of my stuff was ""too mature"" (I'm in my 20s) -- not sure if they meant old \/ worn or mature brand (aka not Hollister Charlotte Russe, some items I brought in were workwear) -- but no matter! That was still a successful return to me. Advice to those selling: bring season appropriate items, & of the items they took from me, they were H&M F21 Ross brands with floral\/polka dot\/anchor\/paisley prints to give you an idea. The store is geared toward teen style on a teen budget & what's trending now. Follow them on social media to see the list of styles they're currently buying. Back to ""mature"" brands point -- if you have higher end items, you're better off selling on Ebay to get a (better) return. Only problem I had was that I did not receive my stamp for selling! I barely noticed when I got home. Overall, I had a great experience & would sell to this location again.",1.0
"This business is located near my home.  We stop in maybe once a month just to check on the poor animals they sell there.   Each time we have been there, the pet cages have been absolutely filthy and sometimes the animals do not have water in their water containers. If they do have water, it is also filthy.  The owners and staff do not appear to care when we bring this to their attention.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.",1.0
"Alright guys... so I've worked in restaurants so I know how hard being a server can be sometimes. However saying that, I've worked with people who are just not cut out to be in the service industry. It's not for everyone. Every restaurant I've worked in as a server, you're expected to know the cocktails and foods that are offered, at minimum. So when it took our server 15 minutes to actually greet us and take our beverage order I thought ordering a margarita was pretty basic. So another 15 minutes when pink drinks were being dropped off at the table I was slightly confused where I was informed that they were the ""platinum margaritas"" that we had ordered. Weird, I remember ordering a margarita and asking what tequila was used (the server couldn't answer that so I said well was fine) but not a platinum margarita. Upon sending it back I noticed on the menu that the platinum was significantly more expensive (which I wouldn't mind paying for, if that was actually what I wanted in the first place) and it came with my choice of chambord or grand marinier in terms of a cadillac margarita. Hmmmm... so instead of asking which we preferred she automatically put in chambord while upselling us without our permission. Shady. Fast forward to 30 minutes and four trips to the table later. I have successfully had to explain to our server what chambord is, what grand marnier is, and what a cadillac margarita is. (They don't teach these things in training?!) The manager had to stop by the table because after the fifth time when the server couldn't get a request right as simple as extra salt on a margarita for my friend, we have just had it. 45 minutes to get a simple margarita order right is completely unacceptable. I'm sorry to say this, but this has to be hands down the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. And I didn't even try the food because the service was so incompetent. Such a shame.",1.0
"Two words. Food poisoning. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner, wanting to try a new (to us) local spot. I ordered the chicken and waffles, he a Cuban sandwich. My waffle was deep fried--and that was not mentioned in the menu. Waffles are not meant to be deep fried, as they quickly absorb any liquid. We both tried a bite and now we are both regretting it. We don't plan on returning anytime soon.",1.0
"Very disappointed. 4 of us ordered lunch from the To Go Menu. Portions were very small yet very costly for what we received. We were also missing a chimichanga. When speaking with the manager, she was not accommodating at all. She could care less that all 4 of us were unhappy...so if you are looking for getting what you pay for...look elsewhere.",1.0
"This place has a really great atmosphere, however finding a parking spot was a pain. The food was just so-so. I had the veggie frites to start and the chopped salad for lunch. The frites were a bit too salty and the chopped salad was pretty sad, made up of mostly romaine. My friend had the tomato mozzarella salad, which looked much better than mine (I had salad envy;) Best thing was the bread, but since I've been taking it easy on carbs, I only indulged in a small piece.",1.0
I didn't care for this place. Small dinning area and there is only one bathroom. I feel like it is completely over priced for what you get and it is not worth the half an hour wait.

"Absolutely gorgeous new Italian restaurant and impeccable service.. but the food fell a bit short for me.

Chic, modern and charming, the decor and ambience was spot on especially with their impressive open kitchen. For a new restaurant, the place operated like a well-oiled machine. The servers were very knowledgeable and experienced with the menu which had a good amount of options and variety. Service was very attentive - my water and wine glasses were never empty.

Where the seams came apart a little bit for me was the food.

Radicchio salad ($13) - watercress, parmigiano and apple vinaigrette. The greens in this dish was quite bitter and just wasn't able to taste much from it beyond the bitterness.

Sea bream crudo ($14) - like ceviche this was thin slices of sea bream cured in citrus juice with chili and basil. Sounded really appealing but tasted just okay and was such a small portion. Shared between 2 people I only had a few mouthfuls.

Mushroom pizza ($19) - out of everything we had, I liked this the best. With caramelized onion, watercress, potato and truffle, it tasted like a wood oven pizza which I enjoyed. 

Fregula pasta ($18) with mussels - in a tomato sauce (more like tomato soup actually) the fregula pasta are very tiny little pasta balls. Mussels were good but I think my issue was that tomato sauce tasted kind of plain..

"I finally made my first visit, and I had the lunch special Manchurian chicken with noodles. I also sampled my friend's chilli chicken (dry) with fried rice. Delicious, and I even noticed the meat quality seemed a bit higher than many other places. Another thing I picked up on, was that the sides were less oily than most other takeout Chinese. This was a especially true for the noodles, which were surprisingly light (not bogged down in sauce and\/or oil) and had some veggies in it, such as cabbage. When I was done, I have very full - but not feeling 'heavy' - if you follow.

The dish in and of itself may be a '4'; however coming under $10 with tax - with a drink, means it's right near the top for quality in its price range. Moreover, from the dishes I saw of those dinning in, and the user-submitted photos on this page, I'm fairly confident it will remain a '5' overall when dinning in or placing a larger order.

I also appreciated the very friendly customer service, which in theory, they wouldn't have to worry about given their popularity. Yet they never gave a sense of being rushed in spite of a lineup, made eye contact and wished me a happy weekend.

Another friend had the grilled cheese with tomato soup. I tried the soup (which I normally despise) and it was awesome! There was a really strong mustard or something in the grilled cheese which kind of was too much for us so may want to get it on the side or maybe we just are weird...

- I drained some of sauce from both meat dishes because it wasn't thick enough. I didn't want the leftovers to get soggy by the next day.

"GREAT CON!!!.....price your sub par over fatty steaks at gourmet room prices then sell them for 1\/2 price every nite. $58 for a bad 16 Rib Eye. Make it half price, $29 and fill the place up. I guess we are all suckers for a deal, even if it's a bad deal.

"Exploring Mile End for the day, I decided to try Lawrence for lunch. It's situated on the corner, a cozy space with large windows, letting in lots of natural light. The place is simplistic in decor, using neutrals, white and black chairs, and a grey and white plaid pattern for their banquette seats. 

Arriving around 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon, there was a short wait for a table. While waiting, I observed the attention to details as the servers were setting up the other tables. Even when rearranging smaller tables to create a larger one, they made sure that white chairs were on one side, and black chairs on the other. As I sat down, I was then immediately greeted by my server. 

The menu had a good selection of small plates, as well as some larger ones. I decided on a steak tartare and an arctic char and brussel sprouts with almonds. The tartare was delicious, freshly chopped, and a perfect amount of salt and seasoning. One of the best I've had. The arctic char plate was a light salad, with cut brussel sprouts and slivers of almonds adding some texture to the plate.

"My friend told me about this place since I work on campus and love a good taco. They have $1 tacos on Tuesday and Thursdays, but since we went on Wednesday there was no deal in sight. We were told that the $1 are smaller as well. I still wanted a taco so I tried a sweet and spicy chicken taco and the beef taco. My friend warned me that their special taco sauce can be overpowering so I'm glad they only gave me a little. The tacos were fairly large so I didn't mind the $6 price tag. The spicy chicken was just right and flavorful. I added a little soy to balance the heat. However, the tortilla was really dry and thick. You should never taste the tortilla before you taste the filling. The other taco, the beef, was okay. The meat was a little dry and it was a little bland even with their taco sauce. Unfortunately my soy sauce could not improve it either. I was happy to see they have the flavored Aloe Vera drinks (Pomegranate!) so that topped off a pretty decent meal.

Oh, as for ambiance, the place is bright, clean, and has plenty of seating. You are expected to go get your food and there is a ticketing system so don't throw away your receipt until you know your order number.

"I can't review the actual work of this salon because I wasn't seen (I walked out). However, I can and will review the service. 

I arrived at the salon at 9:40 after I called the day before and was told the salon opened at 10am, I made an appointment. I went in and was NOT greeted in any capacity. I sat down and waited, thinking it shouldn't be too long as there were only two heads in front of me. After waiting 35 mins, the owner finally confirms the service I was waiting for (a simple wash and set...no blow out) and told me it would be a few moments longer. Another 30 minutes later, I saw she was putting highlights in another customers hair. Anyone who knows anything about hair knows highlight applications take at the very minimum 45 mins for a full head. So I left, after waiting 1 hour and 20 mins. 

1. You should update your clients, letting them know their anticipated wait time. 

2. If someone is getting a simple service, perhaps you should verify that it's ok to start the simple service before proceeding to start a more complicated service with another client (especially if you're the only stylist in the salon). 

3. You should definitely GREET and CONFIRM a service immediately when a customer enters your establishment.

4. If you are overwhelmed with clients, perhaps you should hire additional stylists to accommodate the needs of your customers.

"I've been coming to Angel Blessings spa for over 3 months and all was great. Even had a 4 star review drafted to express my love towards this place...but this evening I am sick and called to cancel my appointment as I'm not feeling well. The owner answered the phone and told me that I need to pay for my massage because of their 24 hour cancellation policy. I have poor reception at home so my phone disconnected. Within a few minutes I received a text message from her saying that I need to pay $38.00. I explained that 24 hours ago I didn't know I would be sick this evening, and she said ""Mayra still needs to be paid.""

Now I can understand the enforcement of this policy if I was a one time customer or someone who hasn't been coming once a week for the past 12+ weeks. I've never been late and always tip my masseuse!  

Not wanting to waste $38, I told her I would come in then and just use the groupon I purchased for my mother (as I don't want to send this place anymore business).  She told me that groupon is for first time customers only (doesn't say that anywhere on groupon) and then she text me ""bring $38"". 

Beyond rude. 

Other issues:
1) they don't keep any customer information so it took them over 6 weeks to stop calling me and trying to give me directions to their spa, a couple hours before my appointment. Annoying.  By week 6 shouldn't I be considered a VIP? 

2) they don't keep customer records to know who you saw last week or the week before. There was a massage therapist that I really didn't like and didn't want to have again. When I was trying to book an appointment with their spa (my usual therapist wasn't available), I was so afraid I was going to get her again because they don't keep records.  I ended up just waiting for my therapist to be available. 

3) they take your credit card into a separate room to process payment. I hate this. It feels a little suspicious and makes me uneasy. 

4) they advertise that their normal price is $80 but you can purchase groupon $38, living social $38, yelp $38 and even call them directly for the ""$38 special"". You're not actually getting a deal. It's their normal price.

"Cheap spot for decent meal but customer service is horrible.  If it wasn't for a family gathering I would have left after my incident.  I ordered a regular Coke but was given a Diet Coke.  So I asked her if I could change my drink out because it's the wrong one and she said no.  Confused, I go up to the host stand and ask for a manager to get the drink I ordered.  I don't think it was a manager that helped me out because she said if it was something she can take care of rather than a manager.  She comes and talks to the waitress and then comes back to my table and in front of my family, tells me that I need to drink all of it before I can order something else or be charged for another drink.

So first off let me say this, this place is small, but very nice! The waiting area has very comfortable couches and the waitstaff are amazing.

The seats at the table are tall-back chairs that are quite possibly the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in, after our meal I just wanted to take a nap in the chair.

Anyways onto the food and staff.

Our waiter was awesome, very attentive and left a bottle of water at the table. I love this and wish more places did this. Being able to serve ourselves more water and having you replace the entire bottle is the best idea, wish more restaurants would do this. He had great suggestions, knew how things tasted on the menu and really made our night.

The food.

Well obviously we had the steak for two with steak frites and bone marrow. The steak was HUGE, enough for 3 people!!! It was not only cooked perfect but the flavors were out of this world. It was tender, juicy and was perfectly seasoned.

The steak frites were huge and tasted great but the winner here was the marrow. I LOVE bone marrow. This is like the food from heaven. I love spreading it on bread, or in this case, my fries!

We ordered a few sides including the poutine and fried pickles. So the ""Snacks"" are as big as appetizers but come at half the price. The poutine was perfect. The fries were crunchy and salty, the gravy very meaty and the cheese curds were actual curds! They did in fact squeak on your teeth haha. The poutine was exactly as I hoped it would be.

The fried pickles are chips, but they are THICK and I mean THICK. The pickle itself had an amazing pickling, I'm not quite sure what they used but it was great!

Overall this place exceeded my expectations and the next time I'm in Pittsburgh I am definitely coming back!",1.0
"Went here two Fridays ago for an early dinner. Food was terrible and dried up. Service was slow, really really slow. The funny thing is that the restaurant was a mess but no one seemed worried about fixing it. Called the manager over who also didn't seem worried or like she wanted to fix anything. Didn't give a good reason why anything was so bad and just said to go and she would comp everything. What a disgrace, I left shaking with rage.




It's been many months since I wrote this review and they have yet to write back to me. Very disrespectful, I'm astonished a corporate place could do this to people. Going to deter anyone to go here to avoid such awful treatment and food. You should be ashamed of yourself and your company!",1.0
My husband and I just started with Dr. Grossman as our Primary Care.  I have NEVER been so disappointed in someone in my life.  Our first visit consisted of approximately 2-3 minutes.  I have a VERY hard time getting them to return calls and my mail order pharmacy can never get him to call in prescriptions - they finally contact me to see if I can do anything about it.  Right now I have a medical problem and have left 4 messages and NO ONE has returned my calls.  He is very curt and somewhat rude to patients.,1.0
"Wow, they do everything so well, I don't even know where to start.

From the basics in appetizers and robata skewers to more advanced Japanese dishes, they are able to deliver a perfect balance of taste, texture and etc.

Personally, I over indulged in everything foie on the menu but they were foie used in different Japanese dishes (e.g. Foie chawanmushi and foie donburi)

Man, I would come back here every time.",1.0
"I've been coming here since it was very small. It has grown immensely. The diversity of animals is fantastic and you can get close to the animals. Also the sea lions are a great addition. The animals are definitely the star (how it should be). However that's where the good stops. Even though the entrance fee was high ($100 for 2 adults and 2 kids) everything in the zoo is an extra charge and not quite proportionate for what you get. In addition, the crowd control for the train and the safari tram is poor. They tell you first come first serve. We waited in the boarding area for twenty minutes and people that walked up just as the tram got there were let on before we were and then the tram was full. The next tram was a half hour wait. There was no queue or way to ensure the people that were there first were boarded first. 

The attendant quickly offered a refund, but did not apologize, just shrugged. They honestly don't care. 

At the train there was a school field trip. We tried to ride 3 different times and were told that the field trip had priority and we would not be able to ride. I appreciate that schools have a schedule, however they should have them all go at once one after the other or find a way to allow other people to ride as well. 

I want to love this place. But as a zoo that relies on the income from attendance, they need to be much more aware of their customer service level and the value they are offering customers.",1.0
"The ambiance of this place is pretty cool; clean and well-kept. Sushi prices are definitely not bad, and I feel like you get more than what you pay for. I ordered the volcano roll and sweetie roll, and neither disappointed. My only gripe is that I don't live in Vegas, or else I'd be here more often.",1.0
"Just because you're in a prime Path location and serving Bay street types doesn't mean you should float on all the reviews of your Yelp friends. The Americano at McDonald's is just as good and the stale pastry better. And it's half the price at Mcds. Sorry, I'm just telling it like it is. 
One positive. The staff are very friendly and upbeat.",1.0
"I ended up doing their juice cleanse at this location, and for the most part, it was pretty good. They were great with scheduling. I got to the location every morning and my days juices were ready to go and they quickly put together my Metaboost salad within a few minutes and I was out the door in 10 minutes.

The juices were really nice and I enjoyed them quite a bit. And despite having reservations with having a salad as my only meal at the end of the day, the Metaboost was super filling and I didnt go to bed hungry (I did go to bed unfulfilled, lets be real, juice cleanses are soul crushing and please remind me to never do one again). Some days the juices tasted pretty watered down, so that was a meh, but otherwise, I felt it was worth the money!",1.0
LOTS of beer choices including their own brew.  12 oz. House October fest beer is 4.50.  We had 2 house burgers with sweet potato fries and deep fried asparagus.  Tasty.  Our bill was 34 so with tip you will spend about 41.  Decent atmosphere and food.,1.0
"The meatball pizza is FANTASTIC!!!  The Zeppoli is CRAZY GOOD!!  Fresh brewed tea from a local place here in the valley.  I highly recommend this great little place .. Locally owned and operated, TRY IT!!!",1.0
"I know everyone loves this place but it wasn't for us. My husband is Italian and knows his food. We rarely go out for Italian so when we do we are extra critical, I suppose. They start with garlic bread which was just okay. Seemed a little stale. We had salads with our meals and it was literally romaine lettuce with some shredded mozzarella. I had the spaghetti and meatballs for my entree and I literally poured out a small bowl of watery sauce. The pasta was over cooked and meatballs flavorless. The apps were in the same categories. It honestly felt like cheap wedding food cooked in abundance. I also asked the waiter for recommendations but he said he was new and not sure what was good. He was very nice but you think he would of sent someone over to help. Unfortunately we just didn't have a good experience.",1.0
"I love my apartment. It's nice, no bug issues. Maintenance is usually on time. 

Now what I don't like is the fact that you can hear EVERYTHING that goes on. I'm sandwiched between 2 apartments (2nd floor) I'm currently stuck with someone stomping around upstairs and someone blasting music downstairs. My bike was recently stolen off the 2nd balcony. 

It's an ok apartment. Community not so much. Staff is willing to help you though.",1.0
Took my car for oil change and alignment.  Made an appt so got my car there on Wed.  However they did not fix the alignment at all and it was still obviously off.  My boyfriend took my car there twice after and they kept saying they were busy.  Ok fine finally made an appt on Saturday.  Called me exactly at 4 pm that day and told me SORRY he forgot they close at 4.  So I didn't have a car the whole weekend and had to get a ride Monday morning to work.  Seriously just coz i already paid they were being a jerk about fixing it again.  We all know we NEED CAR in Arizona.  What kind of company would call exactly at closing time knowing i can't go pick it up immediately.  Would not go back again they can't even fix alignment something so simple.,1.0
"Update on my original review. Food and Service is still the same. However the reason i lowered my rating is they raised their prices without notice. A shawarma wrap used to  be around $4.5 now it's over $6... This isn't going to stop me from coming here, but this was the push i needed to try out the other places in this food plaza.",1.0
"I love coming here during the Fringe, it's a fine selection of venues all in one big area.

I've been to 4 shows in this courtyard and I don't think I've been in the same place twice. The larger theatre ""Pleasance One"" up the stairs is very old school, with the raised stage and cushioned bench seating angled to the back; the middle sized ""Below"" venue is a more modern style - with stage area at the front and the seating rising up to the back of the room.

Then, there was the ""That"" - it was a shipping container with a sound system, bench seats and the comic stood in the corner. It sounds awful but it really worked well. The comic even worked it into his opening comments, so it's also useful.

The staff here wherever you go are all cheerful and helpful beyond belief, managing huge queues with ease and a smile.

Also, in between shows or before and after, there's several drink and food stalls and seating in the main courtyard, superb for those odd days when the sun shines on the Fringe.

One of the nicer venues to visit, pop along and take in a couple of shows!",1.0
"I would give no stars if I could ! Tried to keep charging me for my haircut because of a problem on their end= computer re-booting. Charges kept going through. 
All the stylists were yelling at me embarrassing me in front of other customers. I even called the bank who told them the charge went through and they still wanted to charge me again. 
The final straw was when a young man with a revolver on his hip came to the front counter and stared me down. I was glad to get out of there and would not recommend this place to ANYONE !!",1.0
"Well, went to English's last week with a large group of women.  Resv. was for 2:00 and we weren't seated until 2:45 (place was almost empty) and food wasn't served until 3:20.  As usual, the food and tea was plentiful and delicious, and service once we got seated was OK, and friendly, but waiting almost 1-1\/2 hours with a reservation is unacceptable.  Heard from others that the same thing happened to them on other occasions.  Will have to rethink returning.",1.0
"Ignore the bad reviews for this place....my friend and I dined here last night. I almost tried cancelling my groupon because of the negative reviews..but I guess you can say I read through them as not being completely worthy of such negativity. It is a small restaurant with limited seating..so I can see the chances of a reservation not accommodated to the minute happening. Also that means some seats will be close to the entertainment. It was not overly loud that you couldn't hear yourselves talk. Our 2 pasta dishes were very good. And so were our appetizers...bacon scallops and mushroom bruscheta. The staff was very helpful, pleasent,efficient and attentive. The atmosphere is comfy\/romantic.  The prices are very reasonable even if you didn't have any discounts. 
Errol Fisher, singing jazz was fantastic! 
We would definitely go back!",1.0
"Just got my hair cut somewhere else which actually influenced me to write this review. I don't know why I decided to try somewhere else after going to A Cut Above. Partly because it's a little far from me, partly because I wanted to see what else was out there. I looked for convenience over quality that I know and trust. 

Mistake. 

I'm now in regret mode after getting paying too much for a less than decent hair cut. Definitely going back to a cut above from now on to get a quality cut at a good price.",1.0
"Very friendly lunch spot. Employees really enjoy their job here.  We could tell that there was many regulars (people) here staff was wonderful. Food was great- even friends agreed.  We will be back again.  Very clean, love it. We will get ice cream next time, when we have more time to hang out.  Very relaxing.",1.0
"My experience has been awful. The first visit was very nice, friendly and not pushy at all. Plus I got a great quote. We are looking to lay flooring throughout our entire home. I told her that we wanted to talk it over and reschedule another appointment at another time once we shop around. I rescheduled a couple days later for a Friday evening and the person no call no showed on us. the next day I called the customer service line and told them what had happened and they didn't even act like they cared they just wanted me to reschedule. I ended up calling them back another day to reschedule due to mine and my husbands conflicting schedules. that representative called and cancelled on us. so I had to call back again and reschedule. That person was supposed to show up between seven and nine he called me at 6 o'clock asking if he could come now and I told him that I still wasn't home yet I was coming home from work and he kept pushing me to try to come out early. I told him I would have to call him back to see if my husband was home, which he was so I had him come out early. when he got there he was completely rude, told me that the representative who was there initially had been fired and that I was his clean up. he told me that there was no way that they could do that amount of Flooring for that price and that he was going to have to remeasure and give us a different quote. I told him that it wasn't my fault that they hired somebody who didn't know what they were doing. I didn't appreciate being called the cleanup. especially after all the problems we have had with them already. and then he could just kept giving us attitude the whole time he was in my home and then pretty much just up and walked out. I won't be using this company ever.",1.0
"Without the ENCOURAGEMENT, SUPPORT & KNOWLEDGE I received from Amey, Dr Becky, and my Doula Rebecca Turrigiano, I can honestly say I wouldn't have a breastfed baby. 
My baby girl was born with both tongue and lip ties, from the hospital she had to be placed on a bottle. This broke my heart as I wanted so badly to breastfeed. My wonderful DOULA Rebecca Turrigiano, called Amey and she was able to come right over. I continued to see Amey. She was my sole source of believing I would be able to get baby to the breast.
It wasn't easy, I had to work through my babies tongue and lip revisions,  her feeding discomforts associated with ties, was a slave to the breast pump, and continued to put baby to breast... BECAUSE of the help, confidence and encouragement I received from Amey. I can now say at 2mo my my little girl is exclusively breastfed!!",1.0
"Yep, I'm gonna go ahead and give it 5 stars. Your $10 per vehicle entry fee is good for 7 days. And while everyone often just thinks about Lake Mead here (and the fishing, etc. that comes with that), there's also Lake Mojave, great hiking, scenic drives, and lots of little hidden gems to discover. It's huge! And it's got some seriously beautiful desert views. One of my fav spots here now is Rogers Spring, a fab little gem. In short, there is so much more to the Lake Mead National Recreation Area than you are probably thinking. So get out there and explore!",1.0
"I always end up coming to archis at this location, just because it's the closest one to my house. I've tried archis that are at different locations. For all of the locations I've tried ( sahara, flamingo, and warm springs), heres my review:

Food : always on point with their spicy level, tastes and look fresh, never found a hair in my food, and everything I've tried tasted so delicious (esp. Pad thai with beef)

Waiting time: if you go there at a peak time for lunch or dinner, wairing time to be seated or get your food will take longer than usual but that's expected for any restaurant. Usually I find my waiting time to be OK

Customer service: this part let me drop down 2 stars. No matter what time, day, or which location I go to, customer service is just not good. One time I was still working on my plate maybe half finished,  but my server just took the condiments without asking me if I'm done with it or if I still need it. I find that so rude... and nobody really smiles",1.0
"I had a great experience with Lyft. My dog was sick and needed to go to the vet today. My ride couldn't come at such short notice so I downloaded the app and requested a Lyft. 

My driver, Shelley was here in 3-5 minutes. I went outside to see if she accepted dogs (I didn't know any other way to ask via app) Luckily she did and we were on our way to the vet!  My dog is extremely happy and friendly. Shelley didn't mind the kisses from my pup.

A few minutes later we were at our destination. My first ride was free and I asked Shelley what all I had to do. She said Lyft suggests we rate the driver and they also rate the passenger. Shelley, my pup and I all had 5 star days. I asked about tipping from the app and she said the app let's you tip on there. 

I received a text saying I get $15 in credits so that's great news! Great service and I'm thankful they accepted my dog!! :)

I do want to note that it's not accessible everywhere. I've tried Lyft a few times from Bobbys phone and the app said Lyft only offers rides in city limits. One request was at South Hills Village mall and the other request was for a ride from McKnight road Target which isn't too far. I was confused about McKnight road not being considered city limits. However, my ride today worked out well and that's what this review is about.",1.0

"Was looking forward to frequenting here when i moved into the neighborhood, but after a couple visits will not return. 
First visit we got pastas and the spinach artichoke appetizer,  the dip was great- but our main courses were very bland and liquidy.  Expected better meal for the price. 
Second visit we tried the pizza, again very disappointed.   We got a taco pizza, typically love taco pizzas, bit this one also bland.  Crust was good, but pretty much no sauce or other flavor to it.",1.0

We ordered two capicola & cheese sandwiches to go (we were told that was the best one). I asked for the slaw on the side but they gave me the slaw in the sandwich and the fries on the side- wah wah. Overall, it was average. I only ate half a sandwich at lunch but it felt so heavy and I was full for the rest of the day. Def not worth the calories- so I'd recommend sharing.",1.0

I was born and raised in Baton Rouge and the surrounding area, so trust me when I say I know a good poboy when I taste one! I've yet to try anything on the menu that wasn't to die for. So glad they're back open, and in an even nicer location to boot! No excuses now, Vegas - you have to check out the best in town!

Came in for lunch today around 1:30p. There were about 6 people sitting at the sushi bar. 3 of them regulars from their previous location. So many choices to choose from. Good option for the customer who does not like sushi. Teriyaki chicken and beef. I got the Stacie roll with chicken katsu. So filling. The two gentlemen making sushi asked us if we were enjoying our food. A first for me. Our waitress was great. Hard to understand her English at first but very thankful for our business.  Plenty of seating. They have one area capable of seating 10-15 more customers. Asked the waitress if more tables were going there and she said space could be available for bigger parties. Within walking distance of my home it kind of scares me how many times I'm going to eat here. Plenty of parking. Especially around dinner time when most of the other businesses close by are closed. Located right behind vinny's pizza,1.0
"Well we just went back to the new Rancho Relaxo. The place is so different from the old, even the staff. The food was ok, smaller sizes and little more cost. The vibe from the old is gone, and I think so are we. Just not a place for us.",1.0
"This was my second time dining at nobu inside Caesars palace in Vegas. The first time we did the chefs tasting menu right when it opened and it was a 5 star experience. This time, we did teppan. It was good but not the best teppan I've ever had. I think my favorites of the night were the sashimi yellowtail with Cilantro and jalapeño and the teppan beef. The California rolls were very fresh and good. The teppan cook was great; our waiter however, was less than excellent. Our pot was out of sauce when they brought it to us, I had to constantly ask for water and he seemed annoyed with me when I asked questions about the menu. I didn't care for their garlic rice either which is something I normally love. They add egg to theirs and you can't taste the garlic. They also didn't do tricks like most high (and even lower end places do). Not sure if we will go back the next time we are in Vegas.",1.0
"I went there to get some wine tasting arranged and the owner Valerie is very helpful. She is very detailed and gives good advice on the wine tasting subject.  You can get speciality wines there from France, Italy, Australia and other known places. The shop also offers choices of Scottish and foreign craft beers like the Canadian Blue Moon or the Orkney brewed Red McGregor , dark and black Isles, Erdinger, Azuri,  just to name a few. The shop also sells whiskys and sparkling wine. On occasion they have their own wine tasting gatherings in the shop and there is something for everybody to try. Enjoy, especially if you leave nearby Home Street!",1.0
"I tried this place despite all the negative reviews and the fact that I often see the workers outside smoking in front which is a bit of a turn off. I had the cuban which is turkey, pork, and brisket. It was under $6 for a large sandwich that I was able to get in under 10 minutes through the drive thru. I asked for the hottest sauce they have, and I was given one labeled ""Hot."" It was anything but hot. The flavor was okay, but it was thin and definitely lacking in heat.

I'm grateful to the City of Glendale for taking the time to put up all these lights and incurring the electric expense at no cost to me.  I think the lights are beautiful, it's nice to walk around and feel the spirit of the season.  During the weekends they usually have carriage rides and other vendors selling food and light up toys.  Or sometimes it's a huge event with live music, a bunch of kiddie rides and hot air balloons.  Regardless of what is going on, it's still free, you don't have to pay for anything.",1.0

"This place serves the best pot roast you can buy in Charlotte. I put off trying this place because they don't serve brisket and while I like pulled pork I don't have the same love affair with it to begin with as I do with some nice juicy beef. Based on the reviews from other Yelpers I decided to go one evening after work to try this famous pot roast and I am now hooked.

We were enthusiastically greeted upon entering and led straight to a table. I ordered a $4 mango mojito which was promptly served and it was as sweet as it was refreshing. Since we were basically starving upon arrival we ordered the appetizer sampler. In hindsight this was too ambitious for just the two of us since we were ordering full diners as well. The nachos and potato skins were delicious and the establishment did not skimp on the cheese. I loved the chicken fingers which were juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I am not huge on bone in wings but my dining companion said they were excellent. 

I ordered a soup as one of my fixin's, and it came out before the entrees as requested. It was potato and bacon and super creamy and filling. This could have easily served as an appetizer to hold me over until dinner.

When the mains came (we both opted for pot roast) I saw the soup again and when the waitress saw she remembered that I already had the soup brought out but shrugged and said that I get two soups today. This was totally okay with me - free food is one of my favorite things. The pot roast was completely tender. There was some fat to pick around but the generous portion made me feel like I wasn't being skimped on. They must cook this roast for hours to get the beef so tender. The darker sauce (not sure what it was called, not vinegar based) that was at our table was a great compliment to the pot roast. 

Overall both the food and service were great and I will definitely be back! PS - the leftover pot roast made for great sandwiches the next day.",1.0
"I made the trip to this location as when conducting a Google search for floor mirrors, Rona was one of the places that popped up. A $95 mirror marked down to $45. 
Got to the store and found the area where they were, but it still had the $95 price on it. I waved down an employee and asked him the price. He took the universal code and wandered off, returning in about a minute with the answer I wanted. They were indeed on sale for $45.
Got them to the cashier and it rang it at $22.50 (half of the $45 price point). I mentioned to the cashier that the floor salesman I spoke to said they were on sale for $45, but she scanned it again and it still came in at $22.50. She then called a manager over who said the item was clearance and the weekend I picked it up, there was an additional 20% off...so tax in, my $95 mirror cost me $22. I felt like that IKEA commercial....""Start the car....start the car !!!"" 
Went back a few days later to pick up a french door....also on sale.  Great value! I didn't interact with any employees on the floor on that visit...just found the right size and walked to the front of the store.
Great selection of items, decent prices, ample parking...great store.

"I was very disappointed with the service at this establishment.  I stopped in to pickup a quick dessert since I just finished lunch at a place next door.  I heard great things about Violette's so since I saw it there I figured I might as well pop in and give them some business.  I walked in and noticed to go menus on a table close by the door so I started browsing at that; nobody came up to acknowledge me.  I went to the cashiers counter because I spotted a couple of cake stands there.  I browsed at those and there was a lady behind the counter who didn't say one word to me!!  She seemed busy with either paperwork or money, but she could have at least made eye contact and tell me that she would be right with me or something.  Not one word!!  I left, won't be coming back, that was a horrible first impression of this place!!!!",1.0
"Saw this place featured on TV and thought they have an admirable concept: freshly ground prime quality local beef. I looked for their menu online and while the burger descriptions definitely sounded very yummy, these are some of the most expensive burgers I've ever seen... ranging from $11 to $15 - that's just the burger. Fries and other sides are extra. I have a deep appreciation for restaurants who serve quality local-centric ingredients, and these are described as gourmet burgers, so I figured that these contribute to the pricing. So... I ended up going there to try it. 

When you walk in, you're greeted in a very cool lounge setting, more of what you'd see in an upscale bar\/lounge. The bar sits behind the lounge area with TV's viewable at every angle. The bar opens up to an outdoor patio. Seating for diners are sectioned off to the other side. Very cool decor... they have chandeliers made from wine glasses, and others made from meat grinders. If you walk towards the back of the restaurant, you'll see the open kitchen and their walk-in cooler has a window where you can see where they freshly grind the burgers at. Pretty cool! And outside in the patio, they have a small garden where they grow some of their own crops for use at the restaurant.

Onto the food and service. We ordered appetizers, wings and fries. The garlic parm wings were very good; I would recommend them for wing-lovers. The fries were nothing special... ordered the truffle fries and they were just regular fries with some kind of dip. It was okay. Someone in our party also ordered the grilled ceasar salad. I don't think they really knew what they were ordering. The salad literally came grilled. So weird because the lettuce was wilted and soft. Not a salad I'd want to eat. Anyway... after our appetizers, our server didn't come back for the longest time to take our order. When we finished our appetizers, we had to flag her down to take our order. So service was a bit slow, and there weren't even a ton of people there on this Sunday night. I ordered the Triple Truffle Burger. Their menu describes this as:

""That means Truffles X3. Truffle Salt Seasoned Burger, Petite Pecorino Cheese, Sautéed Mushrooms & Truffle Aioli on a Truffle Butter Bun""

Sounds really yummy, right? I ordered mine medium, so I wanted some pink. Our food comes. Burger comes on a plate with one pickle chip. The burger is not very big... about the same size as you'd find at your everyday fast food joint. When asked, our server says they're about 8 oz. It seemed like I ordered from the kids menu. I finished my burger in about 12 seconds. Yep! Aba dee, aba dee, that's all folks! No, but really... I tried to take some time to enjoy the taste, and unfortunately, I just found nothing special about the ""taste"" of this burger. They claim and advertise that their goal is...

""...to serve the most satisfying burger on earth.""

... but I just found very little satisfaction with the burger. It was small, I don't feel that it was seasoned well - kinda bland, and I asked for medium and mine was more well-done. I've read other reviews pointing out the incorrect temperature. Perhaps their cooks just need better training. After fries and wings for apps, I figured the burger would top me off. Nope! I was still hungry... so I got a large Kit Kat milkshake. It was a chocolate milkshake with chunks of Kit Kats in it. The chunks were too large to suck into the straw, so I almost had a brain hemorrhage a couple of times trying to suck up those Kit Kat chunks. $6 for the milkshake... nothing special. Spend your money on something else.

The owner, Michelle, came around to the tables to greet customers, which was nice. I always like to see that, especially in local establishments.

Overall? I've found much more satisfying $5 burgers in a hole-in-the-wall joint. Seriously - no joke (see my other reviews). Would I come back? Maybe. But I wouldn't be dragging my friends back here to satisfy any cravings.",1.0
"The pineapple mimosas are pretty darn amazing! My issue was with the food. I got the breakfast sandwich which was pretty pricey for just the sandwich and no side. There was WAY too much egg and the bacon seemed low quality. When I arrived for brunch there was no hostess to be found, yet the sign said wait to be seated. I waited around for a few minutes then had a seat at the bar. The service was friendly but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",1.0
"I've been to this Chopstix a few times now and I'll be a regular customer in the future.

My favorite dish is the Mongolian beef. It's one of the best I've had in Vegas. Good beef to veggie ratio. Perfectly cooked. Spicy but not too hot.

I get it on their combo plate special with Chicken fried rice and an egg roll. It's more than enough to fill me up and an exceptional value. The Chicken fried rice is very good and they give you a large portion.

The only downside of the meal is the disappointing egg roll. The filling is mushy and pretty bland. Plus it's more of what I would call a spring roll than an egg roll. 

Service has been quick and friendly. I usually order to-go but the restaurant is pleasant and clean looking.",1.0
"This is the best buffet available in Vegas IMHO. I thought I'd written a review but just noticed I hadn't. The quality of food is great, and I love that their snow crabs are already pre-cut for ease when eating. There's none of that hardcore cracking and digging to find meat, plus crab bits flying into your face, hair, and clothes. Cuz that's super hot. 

The line was a bit crazy, as we went on a three day weekend, and they jack up the price a bit for special holidays so keep in mind to check your price on those national holidays.

The fried food section wasn't as good as I had anticipated. Love the cool metal wire baskets, but the presentation was superior to the taste. The desserts were alright. Here is where I have to give it to wicked spoon--they shine more on desserts.

Service is hit or miss. Could be slow and could be perfect. That's what you have to expect at the old school joints in vegas though. Wait is also hit or miss, you could be eating immediately or waiting 30-40 minutes. 

New York Steak & Eggs - $6.99 - Yes, sadly it went up a dollar. Plain jane steak, Nothing special. Both steaks we ordered were cooked under what we asked but still was tasty. Eggs were cooked as asked. Potatoes were good and seasoned decently. Toast is toast.

Orange Juice - $3.49 - Crazy that it costs half the price of my meal. Typical orange juice with no refill so savor each drop.

My family of 5 ate full meals (steak\/potatoes\/soup\/salad\/bread , lasagna\/soup\/salad\/bread, turkey\/dressing\/potatoes\/green beans\/soup\/salad\/bread, Eggs\/toast\/hashbrowns, stir fry\/soup\/salad\/bread) for $37 (menu price, no discounts), and It was on Easter! All the food tasted great, even our well done T-bone was fully cooked, and still juicy! They can absolutely keep the 1980's decor, and the 1980's prices too!

"Brought a group here for an ESL tour that I'm running. I wasn't overly impressed last time, but we thought that the location was right and we wanted to sit on a patio. I called several days ahead to make a reservation for 8 people.I guess business was slow and it was too cold because by the time we finished the tour the patio was closed. We were fine to sit inside as many of us were cold.

The service was even more so.

I'm not sure if the server was snippy and rude off the bat because he thought the he was going to get stiffed from a bunch of foreigners, but I made a specific point of telling our students that the normal tip amount is 15%. With the attitude we received, I should have told them to leave nothing, but I'm trying to give these students and language and culture lesson, so customs are important.

The minute we sat down he acted like we were going to be a total pain in the ass. He loudly yelled ""So I expect that most groups like this want separate checks, do you guys need separate checks?"" His words were not as biting but his attitude was that of someone who was completely put out by us and our perceived needs.

I politely told him that separate checks would be helpful.

Then he proceeded to yell out ""Just to let you now, I can definitely DO the separate checks, but you guys can't move around and order stuff and switch seats because that will definitely slow me down and you'll have to wait longer for your checks.""

Spare us the freaking warning.  These are adult ESL students-- not children and we have no plans to play musical chairs. If fact, most of the staff who were working were very unwelcoming and not very happy.

To be fair, the guy who served us on the patio earlier, when we were meeting up, was efficient. A bit frazzled, but at least we got our drinks without the attitude. I get that patios are a pain in the ass. I'm a server, too and I understand how frustrating the job can be, but if you don't like tourists and foreigners, you shouldn't be working at a pub on the waterfront.

"We walked in at 9:20pm and tried to find what we wanted so we looked it up on Yelp.  A lady came by and said, ""i know you are looking at the picture online but we are different from the other restaurants, i can explain to you if u have any question."" i feel that she thought we didnt even know what crepe was and we had to look it up online.  NO, we were looking at the pictures from Yelp about your food! You dont know there is a Yelp app?  

Then, she told me that it was good that we were going to order dessert because she had closed the other part of the kitchen.  Your sign said that the place is closed at 10pm and you were still playing live music at 9:30pm and u told me you were closing when i was ordering?  Was it a nice thing to say to the customer? Not really. 

Besides they didnt get me the hot coco that i ordered, when i was cleaning up their toy because my son was crying, this french looking man came to me and asked me, ""can u take your son outside?""  i was thinking my son was crying for less than 2 mins and the table next to us didnt even turn their heads because the music was so loud.

"Connie is great at what she does. I have been getting my hair colored for 10 years and she did one of the the best root touch ups ever & definitely THE best in the states! She matched the color perfectly and you can't even tell where my natural black roots (a little over an inch) had been after she was done, which is how it should be! 

I have gotten color and root touch ups done at various salons in New York City (where I'm originally from), 2 other salons in Vegas since I've moved here, and in Taiwan while on vacation. Needless to say, I have encountered my fair share of colorists \/ hair stylists. The absolute best color \/ root touch up I've had done was in Asia in Taiwan, but I don't think it is fair to compare since they tend to have better and higher quality products there. Connie is definitely the best I have experienced in the US.

I found Connie on Groupon and even though her cut, color, & deep conditioning deal was sold out, she offered me a great first time customer deal ($65) and opened early just to squeeze me in for a Saturday AM appointment when I called to inquire & schedule on Friday!

The cut was great and above average as well...I would say an 8\/10 and one of the top 3 cuts I've ever gotten. I asked for layers to lighten up my hair a bit since it was super heavy, thick, and tangly from growing it out for my wedding for the past year. The layers and style look great but I do feel she took a little too much off with the layering. However, that is my fault for not stopping her and communicating better since I did say I felt my hair has gotten too thick and was weighing down my head a bit.

The icing on the cake? Connie is super friendly, down to earth, and positive. She makes you feel like an old friend the way she engages you in conversation without it feeling fake or forced as is often the case with salon service providers. I will definitely be back! Thanks Connie! :)",1.0
"Scottie, beam me up. Wait, not just me but the entire store and transport it somewhere else because the physical location is a nightmare.

The arrangement of the interior is great, baristas can make a good tasting Starbucks drink, and I enjoyed my time, sipping my drink and reading my book here. I didn't, however, like trying to get into the parking lot nor out. I also elected not to sit outside, but that is just me.

"I just started working in this area a few months ago, but I have only had a hand-full of decent experiences from this location.  I absolutely love Chipotle, and even with my low rating, I still end up fooling myself into, at least once a week, giving them a second\/third\/fourth chance to redeem themselves. My issues are usually: too much rice or salsa, not enough of the meat, not enough of the rice\/salsa, and (i'm not over-reacting with this number) 100% of the time that I visit this location I have to ask them to re-wrap the burrito. Sometimes, they have to do it twice. Even if I ask them to re-wrap it once I am met with a quickly frustrated staff, whether or not the frustration is with me or themselves for not being able to wrap it properly, It still comes off as rather rude.  It tends to be an awkward experience nonetheless. I rarely have these issues with other Chipotles. I'm not sure if this is one of those ""training"" restaurants or what, but it's so bad that i'm close to driving the extra miles to Streetsboro or Stow to try my luck.  I suppose my advice is to have the senior staff\/manager ask the customer if they would like the order to be re-wrapped, especially when the burrito's contents are obviously leaking through the wrapping, or spilling out when being put into the bag.  I actually have a designated towel I keep in my trunk to use when I happen to go to this Chipotle location.  I am finished with having to clean my seats\/floor and spray them down so my car doesn't reek of rotten burrito after the bag rips from being saturated of juices because the burrito was ill-wrapped.  I understand that new hires need to learn how to properly wrap the burritos, but the senior staff needs to be knowledgeable of the state in which there product is leaving the store, instead of quickly throwing the burrito into the bad in hopes that I, the customer, doesn't notice.  If there is a problem, then fix it, don't ignore it and hope it'll just go away.
I hope this location shapes up.  I would much rather go to this location which is right down the road from where I work, rather driving an extra 15\/20 minutes out of my way on my lunch break.  sadly i am about to leave for lunch now.  even after writing this complaint I still somehow convinced myself that it might be ok this time :)  leaky burrito towel in hand!

Spicy Alfredo Italian Sausage Pasta w\/ an added Meatball: the pasta was perfectly al dente, the meatball was a bit ""tight"" (it should have fallen apart, but was a bit too firm), and the sauce was just enough spicy for a good zing... the only downer was the sauce-to-pasta ratio was off: too much sauce, not enough pasta.

"My Fiancé and I were very excited to stay here during the NASCAR weekend, mainly because we really love the SLS in South Beach Miami, and figured it would be more or less the same. Despite some bad reviews and EXTREMELY low pricing I figured all would be fine. However we should have been more cautious. First of all we stayed in the World tower, 8th Floor with a window facing a parking lot and there was really loud music playing somewhere that just pounds into the room all through the night. We had to download a white noise app on the I-phone to keep on all night to drown out the pounding music. Next thing was all the staff kept telling us we must try Bizaar Meats and telling us how insane good it is. So being foodies we were very excited to try! Place looks great but be aware of EXTREMELY high prices, a 1 hour made to order cook time and fair food. For a starter we had shrimp and crab cocktail, which was very good but so small and near $40 dollars, then we had an anti-pasta sampler of cured meats, which was served on a small cutting boards and that was $60. The Really amazing tomato bread that is recommended to go with the cured meats was and additional $12!  For our main course we wanted a filet of some sort and were told they only have Kobe and its $30 and Ounce, so for a 6oz. would be $180. So we opted for another cut that we could share. This was $65 a pound and we were told the only had 2.5 Lb or more. When took the 2.5Lb and it was a huge bone and LOTS of fat and a tiny amount of meat,l not worth $165. lastly I wanted mashed potatoes and although it says it on the menu its very literal. It Butter butter more butter and a splash of potato! was pure butter and the Brussels sprouts were so vinegary I didn't eat them.  So basically we had an ok dinner with 2 glasses of wine and spent $500. But here is the real reason for 1 star! We took a long flight from NY to get to Vegas and so we both brought out Beats By Dre $400 per pair of Studio Pro headphones for the plane.

Well We came back to our room to find the headphones were stolen and who ever took them (housekeeping) thought it would be cute to leave the spare cord out on display making sure we knew they were gone. $800 worth gone! We had just bought those at the Apple store and are not happy! We filled a report and an investigation they say is going on, but they made sure to let us know that because they offer a safe in the room that we should have used, they have not responsibility for them.

The place is pretty small and they only have a few tables, the menu has a lot of options and the food came out quickly. I'll be back her when I'm at wonderland for sure. It's a good cheap meal thats close to wonderland. 

I personally prefer Ramen over Pho but since I dont know of any ramen places this area this is where I will be coming back. Just be forewarned they only take cash and debit.",1.0

"KFC food doesn't really change too much from place to place, but it is the how the location is managed that determines your experience in my view. 

So I've stopped off at this KFC on several occasions, mainly when I have just enough time to put down some boneless dips with BBQ sauce before class. This KFC is a clear step down from the one in Princes Mall, despite its good location.  

The lobby is often times not very clean, the folks who work there sometimes take a while to put your order through, and there really isn't much seating. I think that the cleanliness, or lack of cleanliness, is what puts me off of this particular KFC. Also, the staff has changed a lot over the times I've been in. In other words, high turn over. 

I think this location could be better. It certainly could be cleaner with nicer staff. Not that they are mean, they just don't seem too happy to be working there, which makes me not happy to eat there.

"This year for my birthday my boyfriend paid $350 to have a cake designed for me. The outside was very creative but the taste was horrible and disgusting!  At my party people was spitting out the cake it was embarrassing.
It was a waste of money! My cake tasted very old, stale and dry as if it was sitting out for a week. I ordered pink champagne cake told them make it very very sweet lotts of sugar instead they did the opposite and made  it taste like a sugar free cake there was no flavor to it I was outraged I asked for strawberry filling and they put bananna or some other disgusting filling! The cake was about 6 inches tall\/thick I was told they was going to put multiple layers of filling instead they put one thin layer of filling of a flavor I didn't request. It also looked like a white cake!  Why would they make a beautiful design on a horrible tasting cake If you are going to make a cake it needs to take good and fresh as it looks dont be cheap and not add ingredients just to save you some money. This was a disaster people was making jokes at how horrible my cake tasted. This place is overpriced and very cheap on adding ingredients I will never go back.",1.0

"I like Roberto's Taco Shops a lot. I look forward to Wednesday nights when I can get a couple of $0.99 chicken tacos. And an order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Those are a little more but oh so worth it. This has become a Wednesday night tradition for me. This past Wednesday was no different. What was different about this latest visit was the location. I came to the shop on Russel Road at Boulder Highway as I was in the area. I got my usual order as outlined above and eagerly awaited my mid week treat. The shop was busy this night as is often the case on cheap taco night so it took a few minutes to get my food. I was never disappointed with what I ate though there were some differences from what I am used to. The rolled tacos with guacamole were fine. Crispy and all. The guacamole seemed thin and bland compared to other Roberto's locations. The cheese was pleantiful but not at all melted. The tacos had more chicken than what I get at other shops. That was nice. They were actually pretty solid. What I did not care for as much is the amount of black pepper in the chicken. It was a little heavy handed for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed my meal. My reasoning for a 3-star rating is for the restaurant itself. It seemed dark. Dimly lit if you will. With the area it is in and some of the scary looking people around, I felt a little uncomfortable. Also, when I was ordering, I saw young girl of about 4 or 5 running around the back of the kitchen barefoot. I'm pretty sure she was the child of one of the workers. Perhaps the manager even. But I also fairly certain it is not OK. A child should not be roaming a restaurant at all. Let alone doing it barefoot. Surel there was an office she could have sat in if they had no place else for her. I don't know. That just bothered me. Had I not been hungry and this not been the most convenient Roberto's at the time I would have left.",1.0

"The. Best. Breakfast.  I used Yelp to locate the best place for a birthday brunch and L'Avenue was the number one hit.  Every review recommends an EARLY arrival on the weekends, and I can confirm that arriving before 10am on a Saturday is the best route for fast seating (ask to be in the back away from the door\/draft!).  Quirky hipster ambiance (with suspended bicycles and massive maple syrup canisters) will make you feel like you're one of the cool kids.  Professional nom-worthy menu (with benedicts and waffles and omelets) will make you feel like one of the fat kids (in a good way).
Order up an adult milkshake (with boooooooooooze) then tuck in and get ready to let your pants out.  The homefries: perfectly seasoned.  The waffle with nutella: what dreams are made of.  The omelet: large enough to feed a small family.  It's a large menu with something for everyone and prices that won't break the bank.

This place is fantastic!  Try to pop in once a week to get something new and I'm never disappointed.  Not only do they carry a bunch of stuff you don't see anywhere else they have some extremely competitive prices!  Easily the same or lower than anywhere else I've seen in the Valley.  If the prices and selection weren't enough the owner knows his beer and is always ready to give a suggestion on a certain beer you may be looking at as he's tried most of them.

"I moved to Arizona from Minnesota and with a degree already. I have spent more time being frustrated and waiting hours to even speak with councelers here at Mesa Community, and when I did speak with them they were absolutely no help.

I wanted to get another degree, and have more possibilities, but Mesa Community has made it where I don't even want to go back to school because the admissions is outrageously ridiculous to even understand, or work with one on one (ya know, to make sure you understand and your going down the right path).

"This is a difficult review to write. Initially, I had my mind set on 2 stars. I had high expectations for the advertised lobster roll (Maine lobster, shaved lettuce, brown butter aioli, grilled roll). Well, when the dish arrived it looked kind of messy, as if they just threw the 2 rolls and fries on the plate in a hurry. The was obviously no QC on this dish as it exited the kitchen. It was not bad, it was just Ok and the pickle was missing  from the plate. However, the waffle seasoned fries were really good. And the thing that made me give this place 3 stars was my server.

Lots to see and do here for adults and kids:  clothing shops, appliances\/electronics\/tech, a movie theater, an arcade, a nice assortment of restaurants (some larger and smaller chains, and some fairly unique), and a coffee shop (Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf) that's entirely too small for the volume of people who are often trying to buy coffee there.  Note, there isn't another coffee shop in the entire complex, so if you're looking for coffee outside of a restaurant, you'll have to hold off until you're done shopping.  

Town Square is nearby the airport and south of the Strip, so t's easy to get to and not a bad place to watch airplanes briefly as they're on short final.

One criticism:  In a city where parking is generally free and you have to pay for the Internet, I was surprised when Town Square went to metered parking on the streets.  Garages and the large lots are still free, but curbside parking comes with a price.  I wonder if the addition of meters is just grabbing for more money, or if it's a small indicator of some financial issues that are requiring a little more revenue.  Either way I'll take the garage and large lot parking every time.

I go weak in the knees for restaurants with salsa bars, but this place has a salsa bar on steroids.  They cater to all tastes and all heat levels.

"You have to be kidding with this place.  This is a Bulgarian-run operation with a bunch of people who have absolutely no clue of how to run a pleasing and appealing restaurant in this city or this hemisphere for that matter!

When we walked in there were few people there so we asked for one table in particular but we were told if just became RESERVED so instead we had to sit in a both where one side was about 6 inches higher than the other and the other side had no seat backs, rather a bench type seat.  Interestingly enough, the ""RESERVED"" table that we asked for was still unoccupied upon our departure.

Inexplicably, the rave reviews on Yelp were what convinced us to try to this place.  Many reviews praised the Chicken Kiev, which was quite unfortunate because we were told that they were OUT OF 'CHICKEN FRIGGING KIEV!  

The waiter, nice enough really was in over his head.  There were two different types of potatoes (plus rice) available with the entrees and he TRIED to explain to us that they were both the same dish now because at one time there WERE two different types of potatoes but they eliminated one of the two options but NEVER changed the menus to reflect that.  You can have potatoes or potatoes! Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!  Cheeseburger!

He told us the Greek Salad ($9.95) was more than big enough for four people.  Wrong!   It was barely enough for two people.  He brought it out with a serving spoon on other utensil to distribute its small portions.  I guess they use their hands in Bulgaria.

The music in there was quite loud and we asked if  they could turn it down a bit.  The waiter said probably not because they were going to have a party soon and that was the desired volume.  Only later when we escalated the issue to the owner did they turn it down a little bit.

I ordered Chicken Kabob, with the now unitary potato choice.  My wife too.  The ""kabob"" on a skewer concept was sadly eviscerated here, replaced instead with an open slab of chicken with lots of chunks of heavy duty, 30-weight potatoes to fill out the plate.   Carb city!  I asked the owner what happened to the skewer and the expected veggies on it?  He said this is a ""different kind"" of Kabob.  Get over it!

My friend asked for some gravy or something equivalent to put on his pork dish.  He was expecting something warm but instead was given a bowl of what looked like ketchup and nice and cold to boot.  That is Bulgarian gravy!  

I must say that the food tasted OK, but there was nothing great or memorable about it..  It was like something your neighbor made and invited you over for..  Eh?  OK, and that's about it.

The Russian beer they served was quite good.  Total tab for this food-fest - a paltry $115.60!

I really don't understand all the great review here - I REALLY don't!   ...and really it is not to be considered a ""Mediterranean"" restaurant, in spite of the Greek Salad.

"The Premier Inn on Princes Street is a no frills, high quality place to stay if you are visiting the capital city anytime soon.

We paid £109 for a Saturday overnight stay in a double room. Sadly no view over Princes Street but the room was spotless, the bed was heaven and each room comes with Freeview TV, kettle (with the usuals), towels and a hairdryer. You don't get toiletries and will have to purchase a wash bag if you don't bring your own.

I needed an iron and board which the staff provided for free and brought to my room. There is also wi-fi at an extra cost.

The hotel is situated between Starbucks and New Look and looks on to Edinburgh Castle. To the rear is Rose Street, which is Edinburgh's (slightly poorer) equivalent of Ashton Lane in Glasgow. So pretty much right in the hubbub of the city centre. From the hotel door it's a 10-15 minute walk to just about everything you'd want to do in Edinburgh: the castle, the Dungeon, bus tours, Calton Hill, Cockburn Street, the galleries, the theatre...everything.

The staff were super pleasant and welcomed us with a genuine friendliness, which I haven't always experienced in some bigger hotel chains' check in desks.

The only reason I'm not giving a 5 is because of the lack of toiletries in the bathroom. Squeeze soap dispensers don't cut it but I guess it's part of the reason they can keep the cost down.

They use their homemade ham, which is a little bit different from Canadian ham you used to have, but it is a great match for their perfect creamy poached eggs.

"I had a late flight with AirCanada at 11:25pm a little less than a month ago. I got there around 10pm. I missed my flight because no one was at the counter to help me check in. (I actually don't know if that is AirCanada's negligence or McCarran's. If hiring ground service is specific to the airline and not the airport, then the airport gets 3\/5 stars.) I tried to check in online throughout the day, but their site was down, so I had to go to the check in counters. The terminal was almost empty. The only people I can find was the TSA officers. I couldn't even find anyone at the information help desk.  I'm only giving it one star because there was no wait at the TSA security checks, which didn't affect me anyways since I wasn't able to get my boarding pass.

Rubbish company with no customer service. Our cleaner ditched on us last minute and handy sends an apology email and chooses when to reschedule.

Typically cleaners don't show up with the materials as advertised nor a vacuum. If someone from handy cares to read this I would because this company won't last at this rate!,1.0

"The worst steak and cheese I have ever had! I asked for it to be on a wrap rather than bread and it was, however there was no cheese on it at all. I unwrapped the entire thing to see if there was any at the bottom if the burnt steak and did not see any. I asked the waiter if there was cheese on it and he said, there is so little cheese you can't see it! What? He didn't offer to add more or anything although none existed. He brought my side salad in a togo box without me asking for it. I couldn't even see what was in the container the way he brought it out. The steak was burnt crumbles and just tasteless. HORRIBLE! They also did not have Dr. Pepper or Pibb.

Also there were lots of loud kids in there playing the crane machine at the door, which made me want to walk out as soon as I walked in.

"So like many of you, I have tried this cake and not because I waited in line, nope. 
Not doing that. 

However someone I know did and gave me some. Otherwise, who knows when I would have tried it since in my opinion there are very few things worth waiting in line for 20-30+ minutes in life and a small Japanese cheesecake simply ain't one of them. 

It is a testament to our capitalistic society when people will wait for days in front of a store, say for a smartphone and in some cases over an hour for one (they were limiting cakes to 1 per customer when my friend went) $9 cheesecake per visit. The fact lineups continue after these many months seriously exemplifies that we are hitting the apex of 1st world problems here.  

The cheesecake is okay. Not heavy like your NYC or Philly cheesecake. Rather spongy in texture and unlike a refrigerated Western counterpart, you can leave this cake out in room temperature for half a day and it will be just fine when you come back. 

It is rather light, soft and a little more fragrant, as such the scent of cheese will travel deeper, leaving a longer mark in your sense of smell. It is not bad.  

Is it tasty? Sure. Is it worth waiting longer than 3.33 minutes. No. Not even close. I still do not get the fascination over this particular brand. 

A slight reveal: I have been having Japanese style cheesecake for months now. You can buy it, freshly made in some of the Chinatown bakeries on Spadina for about $4. Not a slice, the whole cake, perhaps a bit smaller than UT's cake. Flavour is pretty much the same, if you eat the one at UT, you will like these cheesecakes too. 

You walk in, you pay, you walk out with 4 in hand if you want, all in about 30 seconds. 

Again, UT's cakes are not bad, yet I do not understand the desperation to stand in line for 30+ minutes for these cakes when equal flavour and quality can be had for less time and money just a 10 minute walk west.",1.0

The won ton noodle soup was very tasty, as were the sel mei, pot stickers and egg rolls. often times at other restaurants,  they are not. The vegetable chow mein was spot on too.

"As with 99% of the other reviews, i was passing by this shop on the way to\/from ""cheese and stuff"" down the plaza - and as we are in the middle of a reno, thought I'd pop in.

I asked if I could come in, which was met with a disinterested ""hurumpf""... sensing the high potential for comedy and in no way in need of anything this wrinkled old bag of bile was hocking in his dusty, overpriced roach motel of a shop; I entered anyway. Well, he didn't disappoint. His attitude sucked,  and his store was filled woth bad relics. As i browsed and made a few comments about some of the pieces that didn't look like he found them in the alley, he got progressively more rude and disinterested.

Once we walked in, we enjoyed their set up and the cleanliness of the place. The staff was very welcoming. The waiting area was adorable, they had nail samples along with Japanese magazines that showed nail ideas which was entertaining to look at while I waited for my friends.

"This place is one and done for me. I ventured here for lunch on a Monday afternoon.  There were a few people seated at tables and a few waiting for to-go orders when I arrived.  I ordered the falafel wrap and tabouli salad, to go.  I sat to wait for my food, as more people funneled in.  20 minutes later, there were at least 16 people in the restaurant and no one had received food.  Approximately 5 minutes later, food was delivered to a group sitting across from me and the order was wrong.  Another 5 minutes goes by and more food starts to come out, to customers that had arrived, after I did. The kitchen was not set up efficiently, which was part of the problem.  The cook kept running in and out of the walk-in, back room, around the counter, etc. After waiting for almost 30 minutes, my food arrived at the counter and I was a bit disappointed in the portion, to say the least.  The tabouli order was impossibly small, more like a side order, for $6.99.  The falafel sandwich was $5.99.  I would think that that the ingredients in a full sandwich costs more than parsley, tomatoes, bulghur and lemon juice, especially for such a small portion.  I arrived back to work, and was even further disappointed, after the 30 minute wait, I expected my falafel sandwich to be hot, crunchy and fresh.....not so much.  The falafel was cold, soggy and mushy.  Twice as much pita, as filling. I couldn't finish the sandwich.  The tabouli had an ok flavor, but the bulghur was still a bit hard, and for $6.99, I would have expected it to be served on a bed of lettuce, with a few slices of pickled turnip, tomato or cucumbers and a side of pita.  This place doesn't compare to Nate's, Aladdin's, Sittoos, Kabob House, nor any other Middle Eastern place in the area, as it relates to value, cost, or taste.  I will not return.",1.0

Dare I say it, but there are Giant Eagle bakeries all over the region that make much better tasting cake and icing than Gigi's does, for a 1\/4 (or less) of the price.  Gigi's icing is incredibly sweet and they're iced so sky high that it's hard to bite into them.  They're the type you will likely need a plate and fork to eat them with.

beef tongue was really thin, so I had to grill them quickly. Beef tongue was chewy

The weight lifting side of things is what sets this place apart.  The machines have been powder-coated a distressed bronze color and the usual black vinyl seats have been replace with dark brown.  The equipment looks like something that would come out of the Porche Design Group.  The rest of the weight lifting side is set up well.  Lots and lots of options to bail out to if someone is on a piece of equipment that you want to use next.  I saw at least 6 different places that I would call some form of a squat rack.

My coworkers and I were having a busy day at work so we decided to call in ahead of time to place a pre-order to avoid the lunch rush wait. When we got there, the Manager was reluctant to provide us 3 separate bills because he said I didn't explicitly told the staff it was 3 separate orders which I DID. All our burrito orders were for small size but they charged one of us large cause the Manager said that was what the staff was told by me. Well, I'm pretty sure I didn't ask for a large burrito order but the Manager didn't even proceed to apologize or say there might be a miscommunication and still charged my coworker for a large burrito. He just kept mumbling ""there is so many errors in this order"". YES INDEED. Yet, he didn't do anything to rectify the situation! 

After we paid, we waited another 20 minutes before we got our food. Even the people that ordered on the spot after us in line got their food and left before we got our food.

"If you've had authentic and traditional Indian food, you will not like this place. It's basically watered down to please people who have very little exposure to Indian food, such as sweet butter chicken that has almost no spices, mainly tomato and sugar, pakoras with ketchup, and some old chocolate dessert I couldn't break with my fork and hurt my teeth. It was a pretty disappointing summerlicious experience.

Are you kidding me! Who in the world would give this a one Michelin star? The food was un-inspiring and some was darn right tasteless. In my whole life, I've never sent a dish back in a 4+ star restaurant, well, that streak has been broken. Since this was the first time we've been to any of Robuchon's restaurants, we decided to try two different tasting menus to experience as much of his cuisine as possible. I ordered the Menu B, which allows me to select 2 appetizers, 2 main courses and 1 dessert. My wife chose their Seasonal Discovery Menu consisting of 11 items. I'll review my menu and let my wife review hers.

1. Amuse-Bouche: foie gras parfait with port wine reduction and Parmesan foam. This is one of their signature dish and it was perfectly blended with a delicate foie gras taste complimented by a sweet port wine with a hint of Parmesan. This was a great start to what I thought would be a great meal.

2. Le Foie Gras: seared foie gras, served with kabocha pumpkin gnocchi and chestnut confit. For a $10 additional supplement, I received 3 small pieces of seared foie gras which tasted like it was seared sometime ago and warmed up with a quick swirl in the pan with the rest of the ingredients. 

3. L'Oignon: onion soup with turmeric spice on top of smooth comté cheese cream. This was the worst onion soup I've ever had. It was completely devoid  of onion taste. I had not choice but to send it back.

4. L'Oeuf De Poulenc: soft fried egg with smoked salmon and winter greens. The greens were crisp, the salmon was tasty, but the eggs did not taste like it was fried at all. This was a replacement for my soup and it was barely adequate.

5. La Morue: cod confit with poached eggplant in a dashi broth with wild mushrooms. The cod was over cooked, the dashi was completely tasteless. The only redeeming grace was the eggplant!

6. Le Canard: roasted duck fillet with sweet and sour pineapple with cilantro. The duck meat was perfectly done and tasty, but I wonder how roast duck can have roasted skin and be soft and non-crispy at all. Was it reheated?

7. Le Chocolat: spiced ""cremeux"" on sage crumbles with ginger ice cream. This was the best thing I had all night. I would come here and pay $15 for this  next time, but sadly to say, I'll never be back.

L'Atelier Joel Robuchon rates as the biggest disappointment from a Michelin rated restaurant. The service was really just par for a 3-star Yelp restaurant, they even forgot my cutlery for one of my course.

If you're lucky to find a free spot, the decor is simple and quite bright. However, there are so many people coming in and out so it might be hard to have a conversation. They also have water at the side for sit in guests to enjoy, which I thought was a nice bonus.",1.0

They're probably the sort that rant and rave about how ""amaze-balls"" Pizza Hut's trendy new crusts are, or who take shots of Papa John's florescent phosphorescent garlic sauce for breakfast. I see a lot of comparisons to Totino's frozen pizza too, and really, that should tell you all that you need to know. You obviously can't trust the culinary judgement of somebody who has willingly ingested a Totino's frozen pizza.

Like many on here, I grew up in Dubuque (And yes, I will party 'till I puke. Thanks for asking!), and I have many fond memories of birthday parties at that location, all the way up through high school first dates. It's a community fixture in a sleepy Iowa town, and for some people that is enough to sing the praises of the chain. For those of you that feel differently, you should try to calm down, be nice, and not be so quick to defecate on a business in the nascent stages of its existence.

When I go to the location in Dubuque, I'm genuinely looking forward to the pizza--and I don't even go for the taco, the old fashioned garden, or the Canadian bacon and sauerkraut. I just get plain old pepperoni. The nostalgia is on the side, but I can take it or leave it.

No, what keeps me coming back is the sauce. It is a great combination of the perfect amounts of sweet and spicy. I love the crust, which kind of has a slightly bubbly saltine cracker pattern on the bottom that is perfectly crunchy, yet with just the right amount of give near the top. I like how the toppings don't stop, they just kind of fade into the airy, pliable, and slightly chewy end crust. I don't know what blend of cheese they use, but it is unique and delicious, and doled out in perfect proportion to the amount of sauce and the other toppings. Put a Happy Joe's pepperoni pizza in front of me, and my mandible goes on auto pilot. I'll eat the whole thing, or possibly die trying.

So yes, some of us DO love this pizza for what it is. Do you really think if it was as awful as you claim, it would inspire such far-flung brand loyalty? Would we really crave it out here in the desert just because we fondly remember all the crazy detritus on the walls inside the Eastern Iowa location?

"My boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place 2 years ago. It became one of our Go To Places. The service, for the most part, was mediocre. Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly!

"I have removed my 5 star rating from The Martini. After several visits, we have learned that it isn't the ""friendly"" neighborhood bar we thought it was. While their drinks are VERY good, the treatment of customers is not so good.  If you tip the bar staff with each drink, you get exceptional service, but if you withhold the tip until you pay your tab in full, they tend to treat you like an unwanted visitor.  Even going so far as to turn the music off when your selections come up.  We have been told they don't like Southerners or Texans. We did move here from the Boston area, but are FROM Texas\/Georgia.

We like everybody else had our mortgage sold to Roundpoint. From the start there have been problems.  We purchased a Hud home with a 203k renovation loan. We had a timeline of 90 days to get all renovation projects done.  When our 90 days was up we didn't hear a word from the bank.  We emailed and called the bank for over 3 weeks straight and still not a word.  We have contractors waiting to be paid for work we rushed to get done. Finally almost going on a month after googling every phone number possible and trying to contact every supervisor we get a response back.  They will send an inspector out soon.  Great finally we think things are moving.  Well what do you know they send the inspector out with some imaginary list that had nothing to do with our house. At least we got that straightened out ourselves. Now what do you know all our mortgage statements we have been receiving at our home for the past 3 months are getting sent to our parents house along with our year end bank tax information.

As always, I'm loving the Maine Root soda fountain.

"I don't have anything bad to say about this place! I love all the brands they carry, and the owner is very sweet and knowledgeable. 

They started carrying brands that were very hard to find in Canada in general - before anyone else. I think they also do a lot of testing to see what ends up on the shelves. 

Some of the lines include Tata Harper, Kahina (love their argan oil!), RMS, Provence Apothecary and many other clean lines. They even carry Mario Badescu (not a clean line but hard to find in Toronto). 

If they have samples they will give you one (but they are limited). It's not a department store where you can sample more and return if it doesn't work (like Sephora - which I like because my skin is so reactive) but they do have a well curated selection and will direct you to the path of high end eco lines. 

Because a lot of these lines are becoming more accessible in the Canadian market it will be interesting to see what new lines they will bring in.",1.0

"Got talked into this restaurant from the lady at the Tickets4Tonight counter who offered me a 50% off discount coupon for the price of $3 pp. Thinking it was a good deal, I grabbed it.

My Girlfriend and I headed out to Planet Dailies after watching the Blue Man Group -- we were pretty much starving! First of all, they have a gigantic menu that had this Cheesecake-Factory-meets-Dennys feel to it. Everything from Breakfast (2 pages dedicated to Bfasts that we couldn't have because it was after 11am), All day breakfast, mexican food, italian food, asian food. My GF ordered the Chicken and Waffles. It was a decent order, chicken breast was moist and fried pretty well. The Waffles were also very good. I ordered (to my detriment) the Singapore noodles from the asian menu. The noodles were bland, not enough shrimp and pork as stated and utterly a waste of asian fusion.

"I was recently in Charlotte for the CIAA weekend, and on Sunday before my flight back to DC, we were searching for a yummy brunch spot to top off the trip. We stumbled upon Tupelo, and despite being told that there was about a 45 minute wait, the kind hostess suggested that we try to find a place in the bar area, which was first come, first served. Thanks to her, we ordered a mimosa (super good and strong) from the bar and hovered around searching for the tell-tale signs of a group getting up.

We spotted a table becoming empty and we bum-rushed it, and a friendly server Cesar came and got our table clean right away. He was SO friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the menu. My friend was vegan, so he also made great suggestions for that as well. Our mimosas were SOO good that we had to get another, and I ordered the Macaroni & Cheese with the Cajun Blackened Shrimp. I felt so greedy gobbling it down but it was so stinkin' good! Cesar checked on us frequently despite having a plethora of tables and other customers to attend to.

The prices are very reasonable, and again, the mimosas were so good! We even stopped by the hostess stand afterwards to speak to the manager, who was also super warm and friendly. I found out that they are opening more locations in the US, so I now have a favorite spot to go to when I come back to Charlotte! Definitely a place where I would return, please keep up the good work.",1.0
"I was so excited to finally try out this new hot spot! The interior is super trendy with free wifi and iPads to use. Customer service is awesome! Service is fast and efficient. Now for the food... I took my vegan sister here for a lunch date and we tried a few different items. Because of the reviews I was expecting out of this world vegan\/gluten free\/ dairy free cuisine, however it was alright in my opinion. I used to be vegan a few years back and honestly I can find way better food downtown or on lakeshore. 

It felt like every item we tried was lacking that extra umph in flavour. The prices were a tad high... But all in all I can appreciate a vegan joint like this in the heart of square one. 3.5 for food and 4.5 for atmosphere and service. Rawtella toast was ok but $5 for 2 slices of gluten free chia bread toasted with a spread is again a bit much since I can buy a whole loaf of gluten free bread at that price. Try the Acai bowl... That was our favourite item!",1.0

The guides were great and perfect hosts during our tour!",1.0
"Long story short, very gimmicky and not worth it.

The food was subpar and extremely overpriced. The foods were very typical and boring, like... Grilled chicken, a Caesar salad, vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake, etc. The most exciting thing on the menu was perhaps the grilled octopus but it wasn't tasty, and I've had plenty of octopus before to compare and know how a properly prepared octopus should taste like.

The section of the restaurant that was lit didn't look too hygienic. Once inside the dark room, I was feeling the table and the chairs and some parts felt sticky.

The server was very friendly but service was incredibly slow. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because the server was friendly.

We got a Groupon but taxes and tip were an additional $22. The food and experience were not worth it, even when the Groupon discount. The darkness didn't enhance the taste experience of these poorly prepared dishes.

sleek- this is a warm app with beans and rice, we put it on pita like hummus. I would say out of all of the amazing food this wasn't my favorite, but it was still good

hummus- creamy, great olive oil. 

Tabouli- A-freaking-MAZING. It had something different in it, like cinnamon or something. Everyone loved it and 2 people got some to go.

Baba-Really good, smoother than some other baba, but I like that. Nice smoky flavor

Pita- average, seemed like it might be from pitaland

spinach pie- this was sooo much bigger than I thought it was going to be, but it was so good I had to eat it all

Other food I didn't eat, but people liked:

Special 1-a roast with rice. Everyone loved it (I don't eat meat), but I would assume it was good. 

Special 2- a french dish with cheese, noodles, and chicken. 2 of my aunts got this and loved it.

This is a mid-sized airport, which is nice. It's not so big that you could easily get lost or confused, but it's not so small that you'll be terribly bored. There's an okay variety of food options. Mostly fast food and standard airport fare. There's a huge food court located centrally where you can hang out while you eat. 

There's lots of seating to be found. There are even rocking chairs! Which I love. The airport's got free wi-fi so you won't get too bored while you wait for your flight.

"Bought an iPhone 5S the month it came out and everything was running smoothly until it one day decided to shut down and not charge. So I went to the Apple Store and checked if I could get my phone replaced since it was still under warranty and apple care. 

I waited more than half an hour just to get a ""hello"" out of one the employees there; an attractive female who walked in after me was greeted immediately. She had broken HEADPHONES which I can almost guarantee DO NOT come with apple care and\/or a warranty; they were replaced within five minutes of her visit.
 
My phone was taken to the back where they ""scanned my idevice to check for authentic Apple parts"". When they came back out with my phone, they told me I had tampered with the motherboard of my phone and they could not replace my phone and my apple care was revoked. 

Keep in mind I was 17 years old at the time, jobless, and I had (I still do not) had the skills and tools necessary to dissemble my phone. 

In conclusion, the team at the Apple Store did not replace my phone because they did not know what was going on with my phone and decided to make up an excuse instead of actually fixing the problem.

"No restaurant in the Tiff Building\/Tower\/Condo is good. The canteen downstairs was bad, and unfortunately, Luma was equally disappointing. One would hope that an O&B restaurant, coupled with its attachment to a Tiff building, would spur good Canadian cuisine. But, nope. I think the restaurant was really just piggy-backing on the location and name of ""Tiff"" without much thought to anything else.

Having said that, I did read other reviews for Luma and most people have really enjoyed the food. So, was it the time of day we went (Saturday night at 10pm?) Or was it just a bad night? Who knows.

My fiancé and I went out with 15 guests who had come from Montreal and so we decided on a central location. The interior is nice: lots of amber lighting, modern, glass, etc... No complaints there. Service was spot on: waters filled, made sure our wine glasses were never kept empty, etc...No complaints there.

But the food, oh the food!

Everyone around the table had an average to less-then-mediocre experience. Short ribs were dry. Not fallin-of-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth kind. It seemed that this short rib was just a left-over for the day. My gnocchi wasn't traditional Italian style, but rather, tasted more like fried dumplings. I don't like cucumbers with my gnocchi. Another friend had the fish which was dry. The accompanying quinoa was even dryer. Other friends had salads (can't go wrong with leaves) and the mushroom soup was overly salty.

So. In essence, I (and none of these people) will be coming back again to Luma. 

I find with O&B, it's either a hit or miss and Luma is a definite miss. My fiancé and I thought it was just the end of the night so we felt like we got the left-over food and tired cook staff. But, is that any excuse? Luma wasn't cheap so a restaurant should be providing great food any time of day. Either way, what a shame.",1.0

I figured that he would schedule something for Saturday because it was late already, but he said he would be over after he completes his current job.  At 6:30pm I spoke to Tim.  While talking I told him that I fix a lot of things myself.  He then said it might benefit you if you could fix the window I told him I had thought about it because it was such a small window.  I had sent him a picture of the window earlier so he knew it was a small window.  He then said if I wanted to try and fix it he would tell me how to do it step by step which he did.

I purchased VIP tickets on the lower level. I was worried about people in the pit blocking my view, but it wasn't an issue.

"Rooster was one of the first places in Toronto to bring to town the now-ubiquitous-cliche-worldwide hip indie coffee house experience complete with decor heavily laced with vintage hipster flea market knick-knacks and reclaimed wood, a communal table (at the back), and emphasis on a quality cup and cafe experience. I seen it turn into that from the convenience store it previously was several years ago and pop in once in a while, sometimes with a friend to hang out. It has become something of a neighbourhood cultural hub. Baristas seem to spend a lot of time with regulars though.

This bright, cozy and intimate cafe has seats for all sorts of typical cafe uses, be it tables and bars for staring at tablets and laptops, comfy recliners.

Usually always busy buzzing, sometimes with live music at the patio. One fun touch is the communal crossword puzzle at the front counter--basically a clipping of the day's paper crossword that anyone can help complete.

Came here after a wedding for dinner and to mingle with friends and was quite surprised with the food and beverages here. Everything was delicious. Had the garlic prawns and the combination plate.

"First night Alley Cat Oyster Bar is open to the public.  It's a very large space with prime riverfront real estate in the new East Bank development.   The whole river-side portion of this restaurant opens up to the boardwalk and river.  There is not a bad seat in the house.

The place was pretty packed considering there wasn't much advertisement for the actual opening date.  A short storm rolled in about halfway through our meal and added a bit more excitement.  Zack Bruell inspected each plate as it came out of the kitchen.

The formula here is similar to other Bruell restaurants.  Bread and oil (thicker slices with corn), prompt service, and a large menu.  The highlight of the menu is a long list of oysters but there are plentiful appetizers, entrees, and fresh catch selections.  There should be an option for everyone.

The clam chowder was creamy and packed with flavor.  The seafood quesadilla was what one would expect.  The grilled cheese was a carb overload and a bit too heavy for my taste.  I enjoyed the halibut entrée but some might be surprised by the Indian flavors present.

"First I would like to say I was super excited to try Giada's restaurant. Watching her on the food network channel I really had thought this would be a wonderful restaurant. OH Boy! was I wrong it was the worst dinner experience I've ever had. First when we arrived we were waiting on our other friends so we went to the bar for a drink I ordered a drink and waited 10min till I asked where my drink was they said they weren't sure they would find the waitress. I told them to cancel my drink and just to seat us. When we were seated we waited another 10 minutes before anyone even approached us. At that time they told us that they were going to have three people helping on our table, the captain and two others. We ordered a bottle of wine which had taken 20 minutes to receive. We then ordered our salads, appetizers and dinner entrées. The appetizer was just average very very small portions for very high prices.  My salad was the signature salad  which turned out to be very bland and the dinner was just less than average. We all ordered pasta. Two out of the four were very nice but super salty and I'm not against salt. One of the other pasta dishes was just average. And the fourth pasta dish which was  Giada's signature pasta was just awful. I was so surprised on how terrible the food was since I own her cookbooks and make many recipes that I enjoy. The service is Horrendous! We were left with dirty dishes on the table empty water glasses and they never came and checked if we would like to order another bottle of wine. All four of us will never go back. There are too many wonderful restaurants in this town. Just because she's on the food network channel doesn't mean her restaurants good.",1.0

The variety and quality of food at Bacchanal are unparalleled even though it is mass produced. 

1. How does the waiting process work?
Walk up to the kiosk and take a ticket which will provide an estimated time to return. Upon your return, you wait in line to pay for the buffet, after which you wait in a final line to get seated. 

2. When is the best time to dine here? 
Arriving at the tail end of brunch\/lunch (between 2-3 pm) allows you to sample both the brunch and dinner menus at the brunch price as the restaurant transitions during this period.

"Had a great first experience here, and felt like a total badass shooting some guns. I came with a group of 14 people for a friend's birthday. We had reservations, so there was no problem getting waivers signed and ID checked and equipment ready to go. Despite looking a little intimidating at first, all the staff members ended up being very nice, professional, knowledgeable and efficient. Of course they take safety very seriously here, so I felt comfortable the whole time. We each paid $100 and got to shoot the following:

20 rounds of 9MM
20 rounds of .40S&W
10 rounds of .45ACP
5 shells of 12 gauge 00 buckshot

Staff members help you load your guns and supervise you while you shoot, and also provide you with tips on holding the gun and positioning your body. It's a pretty cool experience, but 20 rounds goes by really quickly when you are just shooting away. They are cool about letting you take photos and videos as long as it's for your own personal use, and they also let you take the bullet casings home with you if you so wish! Plus you get to keep all of your targets for cool souvenirs.

I will say though that I wish it could somehow be made more interactive for people who book group events... like encourage people to keep score to make it more competitive? But in the end this is still a really fun activity to do with a group of friends, and just a cool experience overall to hold and shoot a real gun.",1.0
"This bakery is somewhat of an institution in the Pittsburgh area, and for the most part, its reputation is well deserved. I don't think it's the best bakery around -- it has a huge selection of goodies (which is great), but I think for that reason there's a bit of a quantity-quality trade off that happens here. That being said, I've been here several times, and I'm always fairly pleased with the things that I get. Their cupcakes come in wide variety of flavors and are always beautifully decorated. Occasionally I find that their cupcakes are drier than they should be, but the flavor is usually good, and their frosting is light in texture with the perfect amount of sweetness. They also offer donuts, pies, cookies, breads, sandwiches, and other things I'm surely forgetting. In terms of selection, it probably is one of the biggest bakeries in the area.

Because they are so big, they keep their cases well stocked...I've never gone here seeking a particular item and found that they were out of it (even late in the day). It is crazy busy at all times, but take a number and you'll find that the lines move quickly.",1.0

"The condos around Shops on Don Mills are so lucky to have McEwan's to shop at - this place really caters to condo living: Really yummy prepared foods, nice cuts of meat and fresh fish, and gourmet selections of oils and bites for entertaining.

I really like buying the various varieties of cheeses, oil and vinegar's, meats and fish. The sweets here are really yummy as well. It's expensive, no doubt, and you can probably buy the same tomato and cucumber for less at the Metro in the same plaza. But I think this place caters to the immediate condo dwellers that don't mind buying high quality items for 1 or 2 people. Buying for a big family at McEwans just doesn't make economic sense. 

Highly recommend, for well-deserved splurgy items such as steak and fish. As high-end grocery stores go, I BY-FAR prefer McEwan's to Pusateri's.",1.0
"AUTOMATIC CONTRACT EXTENSIONS ARE A PROBLEM. I saw a trainer here for 6 months and was very happy with the trainer, but not with the automatic rollover and continuation of my trainer agreement once it was over. My trainer agreement was for 6 months. At the end of the 6 months I called to make sure they would not continue to bill my credit card, and they said YES THEY WOULD and not only that, my next $300 payment would automatically happen tomorrow and there is nothing to be done about it. Apparently the contract includes a statement that if you don't cancel 31 days prior to the end of it, even though the end date is listed, they will continue to bill you even after the end of the term. I called the manager and he said that is automatic with corporate. Fortunately the manager is working with me to use up the unwanted purchased sessions over a longer term than the usual 90 day expiration. i don't feel contracts should include this type of automatic ""gotcha"" clause, but I've run into it elsewhere and simply didn't think to look for it here because I had a specific start and end contract term. Both the person who receives the payments and the manager stated that it says right in the contract that it would roll over. Whether this is true or not, it feels like a trick. And who remembers from the moment they sign to 6 months later? I would never sign a contract with this company again. That said, I feel the need to say the training is awesome. I'm still giving them 1 star based on this crappy contract thing.",1.0
"Record City is a heavy contender for best vinyl store in Las Vegas.

"While I was happy to see a chicken wing place open up nearby, I must say I'm disappointed. 

First, I asked if any of their flavor were a dry rub or a wet sauce. The girl said all wet. I specifically asked about the Garlic parmesan. Got 28 wings, fries and a sweet tea. $29, not bad. 

The fries were delicious, hot and tasty and not over salted. The sweet tea was also good. 

The wings? Not even as good as wingstop or BWW. I'd compare them to run of the mill bar wings. 

The sauces? They all had little to no flavor, I got their hottest ones and they weren't even slightly hot. Their garlic parmesan was a dry rub with butter mixed in or something. Not even tasty. The mango habanero was decent. 

The Ranch? Pretty Damn good actually. Better than most places. 

The service? Friendly and was decently quick.

I lived in Phoenix and came across Hissyfits on Yelp while I was pregnant and wanted to visit however I moved out of the state and never made it to the store. 
I recently started shopping on social networks and supporting small shops and was so glad to have come across HF. I ordered an item and was charged for it, two weeks went by and I was a little concerned that my item hadn't arrived, I assumed they were busy and only made PO drops some days. We'll I decided to contact them yesterday  (three weeks later) only to find out they made a mistake and they had to refund my money. Unorganized much?

"A reason to return to the Bellagio! Something new and exciting at the former Circo property by Julian Serrano. The renovation was well worth the wait and one of my top places that I was anticipating. We were greeted at the front by very friendly hostesses that informed us we were free to view the restaurant while we waited. Wannee was especially helpful and informed that our beautiful table on the patio was ready and what a beautiful night it was to be outside.
The room is very modern European with a nod to retro.  The color scheme starts with warm orange and red tones near the front, then graduates to cooler blues in the back of the restaurant with white the backdrop. Straight ahead is the view of the Las Vegas Strip and the famous Bellagio fountains, to the right is the lovely patio.
We were seated right at the edge just as the fountain show began, there was even fog on the water which made the view even more special. The weather was perfect and the Strip in the background was ever so pretty.

We chose a few small plates to try. Brian our server suggested the crudo sampler, there was tuna, scallops, and salmon.  We also had a Cesar salad, the risotto, short ribs, and their famous gnocchi and lobster dish that melted in your mouth! Oh I cannot forget to mention the quail saltimbocca!!! Try this twist on the classic saltimbocca, I like it much better than veal or chicken versions. They have a nice choice of cocktails and even the bartender made me Virgin cocktails that were refreshing and beautiful.

Dessert was also excellent, the menu being on same Ipad list as cocktails and wines. Very fun and interactive. Sharing is encouraged here and this is a spot pre-club kinda place. Where you can still eat good food and feel comfortable to dance the night away. Hyde is located next door and Lily and The Bank are very close.

"This is the best restaurant at the Phoenix airport. I've been here many times for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and had a pleasant experience every time. The staff is very friendly and the food exceeds your expectations of airport food. 

The burritos are a great option for breakfast or dinner (I've had them all). I think my favorite thing here is the Mexican Café. It's a rich full bodied coffee with complex flavors served to you fresh in a French press. I've emptied it every time I've had it! I get it even if I'm flying home at 11p. I risk being up all night just to enjoy the great café!

If you're at the Phoenix airport on a long layover or just want a bite to eat, go to Barrio Cafe! Make sure you get the coffee!

This review as of now is based on one visit and one plate. You have options between ordering Chinese or Thai dishes and lunch specials are available. I had the pad Woonsen lunch special. The price to portion ratio is exceptional. You get a lot of food for a few dollars. As far as flavor goes I will not be trying that dish anytime soon though I will be back to give another dish a try. For quick cheap eats this is an acceptable stop. Be sure to take advantage of the awesome lunch specials.,1.0
"Stopped in to this location on a Sunday afternoon recently on the search for good Falafel. The Phoenix area as a whole has extremely mediocre middle eastern food and there is not a single restaurant in Phoenix I have found to date that can match the heavenly Falafel that is served at Falafel's Drive In in San Jose or the various Zankou Chicken outlets in the LA metro area. 

With previous disappointments in mind we decided to check out Sharazad due to the great reviews it has received to date. 

When we arrived at about 2:00 pm the restaurant was a ghost town. Other than the staff and my girlfriend and I, the restaurant was empty. 

But to make a long review shorter we both ordered falafel plate with a side of rice and fries. The falafel was just right..not too heavy and oily and not too dry like other Phoenix restaurants have a tendency to make falafel. In addition the Tahini sauce was very good and the fries were cooked crispy.

All in all, not bad at all for Phoenix. No where near what I am used to in California but up until time that I escape back to California in the near future it will be my goto place in Phoenix for Falafel.",1.0
"My girlfriend and I decided to try something new for our weekly get together and we settled here. We were amazed to see that the menu resembled Burgatory which allows you to ""craft your own burgers"" in a similar fashion.

We had table seating in a wooden western style room. The waitress reviewed menu options with us so the two of us decided to try the BRGR signature burger. We were stunned that this burger comes with foie gras (a $12.00 upcharge if you opt for it). Haven't seen foie gras in any casual family dining in my life! The two of us also decided that since the burgers were 8 oz we would split an order of cole slaw which came with gold raisins and carrots.

While we were waiting for the entree the manager came and explained to us that this is the 4th restaurant in the city and when the weather improves they plan to expand and put on an outdoor deck for outdoor dining.

We had our meals served fairly rapidly. The BRGR is dry aged prime beef alone with pickled red onions, arugula, creamy blue cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. Laying on top of the burger was a long piece of the foie gras. Since we both ordered the same thing we found the burger enjoyable but nothing to give a hoot about. We had ordered it well done and it came that way.

On the other hand we were definitely impressed with the cole slaw. The addition of the gold raisins made it so good!!!

I found that this place has complimentary Wi-Fi. They also specialize in milk shakes and floats where you can choose to have them ""spiked"". They have a wine and alcohol list as well since they have a bar there but we were too full from our meal to try any of these.

The place wasn't overly crowded since we came mid afternoon and we were each given paper copies of the menu to take home. I guess they must have take out but I really don't know for sure.

As far as the foie gras goes, it is overpriced and I feel it is a delicacy you would better enjoy in a finer restaurant.

Other selections include various appetizers, hot dogs, and salads. The Galleria where it is located has a multiplex theater inside of it and this place would be a great place to go before or after a movie.

We will give it another try sometime in the future.",1.0
"LGO is a great, feel good place to spend an afternoon.  I've never brought someone who didn't find something to like about this place!  

A tip: Pull into the Postino's parking lot & valet your car!  It is free (with gratuity, of course) and much easier than trying to find parking in the front.  Then, you can walk around to the front of the store or cut through the back entrance.  There are some small tables in the grocery store portion as well as plenty of tables in the restaurant portion.  During the day, you order in the grocery store, find a table, and wait for your food to be served.  In the evenings, you are seated in the restaurant portion and have a server to help with the ordering.

There isn't much I don't like about this place.  There are cute trinkets to look at while you are waiting for your food (or if you want to hang around after).  There is a dog-friendly patio out back.  All of the food is pretty much stellar - this is NOT going to be the MOST amazing meal of your life, but its pretty darn good for brunch.  Their pizzas are some of my favorite in the valley!  I highly recommend!  You can also pick out beer or bottles of wine from the grocery store to accompany your meal.

These poor folks are the closest restaurant that will do during lunch or early dinner (as I call ""linner""). 

They're scrutinized big time since we cannot enter the Bacchanal. Because of that I chose to review them much later. 

Now w\/all that being said, I think it's par to give them 3 stars.

I agree w\/most concerning the prices. There's nothing special about their food except for their convenience. 

The food was edible but if you're starving, anything dead will do. My beef chow foon (same as drunken noodle) tasted as it should and his kung pao chicken was flavored properly. We looked at each other and said ""3 stars"". 

Memorable bites were from the green onion pancakes but I'm partial to fried carbs. 

Finally we give kudos to the line hostess. She asked each small group if they'd like to sit at the front bar stool section when any opened up. We took the offer to jump the line.

"Update on this Mastrioni's 7-1-2016.
I have since gone back and given this another chance.  It was super and back to the original service I experienced originally.  The owners are from New York and have made this place one of the best Italian places in Vegas.  If you like watching the kitchen and food preparation, sit at the bar and enjoy the show!
Original review 6-3-2015
First off let me say this was my go to Italian place!  Ive gone 6+ times and have no problems with the price as long as the food is great and service is super too. 
That being said...one of my favorites is the seafood over linguini....in the past it was awesome with a nice blend of seafood.  This last time...it was LOADED with calamari and they were as rubbery as hell.  I literally could not eat it.  I was stunned!  Usually the food has been SO GOOD in the past...I wondered if they changed owners or chefs.
I ate what I could...then decided some spumoni pie with coffee would end the meal on a high note....well not so.  The coffee was good..but the ice cream spumoni pie was direct from the deep freeze and was HARD as a rock.  It was not edible until it defrosted for 30 mins....I was so disappointed in Mastrioni's.

I did mention it to the waiter...but he just shrugged it off saying it will get better when thawed...well no duh.

Then to end the evening...the wait staff do not seem to know what one is doing with the others.  The table next to ours....the couple left...and it sat for a few mins before they could clear the dishes.   Then another wait staff came over and removed the table cloths and napkins and placed clean a clean table cloth on.
LOL then the original wait staff came over and  removed the table cloth thinking it was dirty...and proceeded to put another one.  It was comical.  Hopefully they will smooth out the rough edges.",1.0
"Since they deleted my last review, here it is again.
The management actively does not care whom they rent to. I was physically threatened by my upstairs neighbors, and when I brought it up to the office, not only would they not do anything about it, they cared only about getting their two months rent that was needed for the end of the lease. I would strongly recommend to anyone who is contemplating this rental establishment to seek elsewhere.",1.0
"DO NOT STAY HERE!!! Never have I had such a horrible experience at a hotel. Upon checking in we were pleased with the room but found that the toilet was clogged and overflowing and the bathroom unclean. We called to report the issue and it was taken care of immediately so we decided to stay. The rooms are old and outdated, but serviceable. Definitely nothing fancy that would make you think of a great Las Vegas casino (something to keep in mind when the cheap rates make you feel like you're getting a deal).  We booked the room with intentions of using the internet to get some work done before spending a night out in the city. When we tried to connect our cell phones and laptops to the wifi, we were unable to due to the network being unavailable. We called the front desk and were told that they would reset the router to try to fix the issue. We waited a full hour before trying to reconnect and were still unable to. At that time I went to the lobby to speak with someone about the wifi issue since it was imperative that we get our work done. After explaining the issue to the front desk clerk (Travis), he rudely demanded that I bring my computer down to the front desk. When I said that I had not brought it, he pulled out his cell phone and said ""well my phone is connecting fine"". He then rudely explained how he was able to log on on his cell phone and said ""I don't get why people don't get how to do this"". I went back to my room and tried to log on the way that Travis told me to, but again got an error message that the network was unavailable. I returned to the front desk with my computer where I spoke with another employee who could not take his eyes off an online poker game long enough to give me any assistance. When I finally had his attention he was unable to help me and said that when the manager returned he would have him get in touch with me. I told him I would wait. A moment later, Travis walked in and tried to ignore that I was there. When he finally acknowledged that I was there I told him that I was still having trouble getting online and he said ""I was just around your room and it works fine"".  I explained to him that I was able to get the wifi to work in the lobby (a smoke-filled casino\/bar), but not able to get it to work in my room. Travis didn't believe me and again stated that it worked for him on his cell phone when he was just there. He said ""I can show you"" and we walked down to my room. Outside of the door to our room he tried to ""prove"" to me that the wifi works because his phone was connected. I waited patiently while he talked down to me about his cell phone. When he was done, I said that's fine, but I need it to work on my computer. He said ""well it's a problem with just you because I could call anyone in any of these rooms and nobody is having a problem with the wifi"". I didn't feel like entering into a pissing match with him because it was already to a point where he was extremely rude and disrespectful. At that point, I turned to leave and opened the room door. My friend was inside the room on her way out because she had heard him raising his voice at me. He continued to berate me and I told him that he needed to stop because he was being very unprofessional. He then yelled at me ""you're being unprofessional as a customer!"" At that point I had guessed that he was the manager and asked ""are you the manager?"" to which he replied ""ARE YOU A GUEST HERE!?"" I asked for the name and phone number of his boss and he said ""Sure, I'll give you his name and number. You can tell him what I said, and I'm going to tell him what you said, and we'll see what happens!"" I followed him to the lobby and got the name and phone number of ""Mr. Brown"". He again threatened that he would tell ""Mr. Brown"" what I said. I hurried back to the room and locked the door and my friend and I googled the phone number to reveal that it was just the number for the hotel. Reading through previous reviews where, on multiple occasions, people were kicked out of this hotel or threatened bodily harm made us feel unsafe. We gathered our things, had the room payment cancelled, and fled the scene. This place should be shut down. It seemed pretty clear that Travis knew that if I contacted ""Mr. Brown"" we would be kicked out of the hotel or worse. He was pretty secure in his position to be so condescending and rude. The guests in this hotel are definitely not a priority. If you value your safety, STAY AWAY from the Mardi Gras Hotel.",1.0

"I would really give Perk a 3.5 out of 5 stars. I used to rave about this place right when they first opened but my recent visit with my dad was only sub-par. The staff is friendly and accommodating. However, we were sat down first and then a couple arrived and was seated next to us about 5-10 minutes later and their order was taken before ours and they received their food way ahead of us too. That's just me being a little picky but I was very hungry and both of us were ready to order asap. 

I ordered the Bahama Mama sandwich which is a unique dish on their menu as you can't find it anywhere else. It's very yummy, I love the combo of the pineapple and special cucumber sauce. My dad ordered to eggs any style with bacon and potatoes.

We both ordered pulled pork plates.  The pork was on the dry side and cold.  Not refrigerator cold, but room temperature cold.  We were there for dinner, so maybe it had been smoked quite a bit earlier in the day.  Regardless, it was not great.  The Texas toast was really just thick sliced bread.  But the plus side of dry, cold pork was that the bread didn't get soggy in the box.  I had beans which were still a hair underdone.  I also tried the slaw which I  didn't like at all.  I expected mayo based or at least vinegar based, but it tasted like it was dressed with nothing but oil.  Why my husband opted for the Kraft mac 'n cheese rather than trying their baked version, I'll never know.  But even that is much better when you make it at home. 

On the plus side...excellent potato salad.  Mayo dressing with just a hint of mustard, not like the overly sweet crap you get at the deli.  Smore dessert was yummy.  Staff was awesome.  All very polite, and they pack to go orders in front of you, so no surprises when you get home.

Based on all the other positive reviews, I would like to try going again sometime. Maybe lunch would be better.  And maybe I can get my car washed, too.  God knows it needs it.",1.0
"Probably my favorite of the ones nearest me.  Kids are always fun and quick to let me know what the sales are.  The one kid though has zero customer service skills and would rather gossip about what's going on at the Piercing Bagota than wait on customers with armloads of shit..waiting to give THEM MY MONEY.  Store is always clean and tidy.  Its a bit pricey and the stuff can be found online way cheaper but if ya need something quick stop in.  Also, the rewards thing they started is good.  Sign up!

"I was pretty excited to try this place because it's close to home, and I don't always want to go all the way to Chinatown on a Friday night. 

We ordered veggie egg rolls and shrimp spring rolls for appetizers, and they were pretty good, except the shrimp didn't seem too fresh. 

Sadly not really. I read reviews before choosing this place and figured like every other Thai or Vietnamese place in Vegas, mixed reviews are pretty standard. But the negative reviews on this place were spot on. 

I got the beef brisket and flank soup, and the meat was nowhere near as tender as it should have been, and definitely had a weird color. Hubby got the beef combination and in his words ""WTPho is WTSuck."" The broth was very plain.. Had to add tons of sauce and sriracha to give it any flavor. Needless to say, next time we're craving pho it won't be satisfied here. 

On to the good.. Service was excellent! They were quick to refill our drinks and asked multiple times how we were doing, so they get stars for that. And then dessert.. Tempura ice cream. How can you ever go wrong? Delicious :) 

So if you're looking for a pho spot with mediocre pho but awesome people and ice cream, this is the spot for you. Next time we'll just take the trip to Chinatown for the good stuff.",1.0

The salmon was excellent.  Seared to perfection and superb quality of fish.  I loved the mashed potatoes and green beans.  The ceasar salad and the lava cake were average.

Parking can be difficult here and valet at E 4th maybe your most convenient option, I think with receipt the valet cost should be under 10$ but not sure.

"This restaurant is not as great as it seems. I've been here many times and have noticed a variety of horrible things that management does to their employees. During some very busy rushes there was only one waiter and one busser for the entire restaurant. I felt horrible for the busser because she was having to do jobs that were in the waiter job description while at the same time still being a busser. Also while doing both of those jobs being the hostess at the door. At one point she was cleaning a table for the customers at the door while getting yelled at for not being at the door. What kind of manager treats their employees like this. Especially when they are working hard for them. We talked to the girl later after the rush died down and upon asking her a few questions we found out that the bussers at their restaurant work more than the waiters, do all of the jobs of the restaurant, yet only get paid to buss tables. They get tips but only if the managers think that they deserve it from that day. We talked to a few waiters also and they all told us that they felt extremely overwhelmed seeing as how they're weren't enough waiters and bussers to take care of the needs of the restaurants yet the managers don't seem to care. One time we even noticed the managers drinking on the job. I was horrified! How does this place stay in business! We tried talking to the managers about it and they just shut down. We pulled a worker aside and asked her to be honest with us about how she felt about working there and she told us all the employees get along really well but are miserable working there. The entire kitchen staff is illegal, they smoke marijuana in the kitchen around the food, the kitchen staff touches the underage young girls that work there and make them very uncomfortable and the manager did nothing about it when they went to him about it. The young lady told us they even take their tips sometimes! I am dumbfounded by how the police haven't raided this place yet! I feel terrible for the employees and hope the best for all of them. Do not go to this place and support these terrible managers and practices!",1.0

Service was fast and friendly. This is only my first visit and it won't be my last. I really enjoyed my Pancit. It was very delicious. The Garlic Fried rice was yummy too. I still want to try their Log dishes. They sound so appealing. I have to say that the restaurant was clean and the decor was nice. Kudos to the girls at the front counter. Plenty of parking too.

"In a word - despite being far from the city, this is one of my absolute favorite hotels.

Longer version (for the brave) - I've been in this place for a couple of times during business travels and even though Stuttgart is far away and usually we don't have time to go out and stroll the city we feel quite alright in the hotel.

As we arrive rather often and stay there we are already known among the staff, so it's kinda like a home away from home.

The rooms are squeaky clean, the design is very modern and the bed is so comfy! 
Every time you check in there will be something sweet by your bedside - gummy bears of a little chocolate, which always puts a smile on my face :) 

The wellness center is just amazing - it's not open for long but you can be inside for a couple of hours without even noticing.
The gym right next to it is well equipped despite its size and never too busy.

And now - to the food!
At the reception there's always water, ice tea and some fruits and candy up for grabs.

The breakfast offers a wide range of pretty much everything you want - from warm sides to different kinds of eggs, DIY muesli, cheese, sausage, fruits, pastries- there's something for everyone! Wish I had a bigger stomach! 

The restaurant offers a variety of foods, prices are rather high (still, a hotel. At the an airport.) - but the taste is great.

Down at the bar you can also order some food and snacks, the bar is well equipped with pretty much any type of alcohol you have in mind and the atmosphere is younger than the restaurant.

"I'm visiting Arizona and I'm not from around here. I went online to order food to go. I called the Tempe location but was unaware the numbers listed were for both Tempe and Glendale. I placed an order for 2 pounds of crawfish and the lady advised me that they only had frozen crawfish and it was $7.99. I drove to Tempe and the server at the front named Kristina was not able to find my order.  Come to find out, i placed my order at the Glendale location.  One of the male workers was kind enough to call Glendale location to cancel my order. 

I told Kristina that Glendale location advised Me their crawfish was frozen. Kristina and the male employee looked at each other and said,  ""Glendale may have ran out of live crawfish but our crawfish is alive and fresh.""

LIARS!!!  They charged me $10.99 for a pound of soft shelled, broken, tiny frozen crawfish.  
I'm originally from Houston TX and is a hardcore crawfish Lover. I know my Crawfish. I should of asked her to show me one live crawfish to prove it. 

Note to Kristina:
1) it is NOT crawfish season
2) Dont lie and tell someone your  crawfish is alive and fresh when it is really frozen. 
3) you can easily tell frozen crawfish from fresh crawfish.  No need to lie, it just makes you look like a pathetic liar. 

How to quickly tell frozen crawfish from fresh live crawfish:
1) Frozen: shell is soft, Cracks and beaks easily.  Shell  can almost be paper thin. 
Live: shell is hard and firm. Color is dark red and vibrant. 
2) Frozen: meat breaks apart in pieces. 
Live: meat is like fresh shrimp. 

I also ordered lemon pepper mussels, which were extra salty and punched a stack of high blood pressure and stroke if I ate any more.

"After a couple visits, I think Watan Kabob has become my go-to for Afghan food. 

The food is always fresh, the portions are big, and the prices are reasonable. 

I have tried the Tandoori Kabob, Chicken Breast Kabob, and Chaplee Kabob. My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you aren't looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...

The salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. 

Watan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called. 

It can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you. 

Watan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason I would return to Paramount is for their appetizers, manakeesh, and baklawa.",1.0

Well it sounds like Le Village Buffet is the place for you!  *cheesy smile*

With ~$30\/p for dinner, you just can't beat it when compared to other buffets that cost much more than that per head.  

Because I'm one of those cheap and uncouth buffet goers, I can't say I'm a complete fan.  Their seafood options are really just cooked mussels and clams, plus the usual cocktail shrimp.

"I stumbled upon D&R House of Diamonds on Yelp, and based on the reviews I knew I had found the place to purchase an engagement ring. I set up a consultation with Dave for the following day, and it was one of the best decisions of my life. I came to him with fairly specific ideas for the ring design and diamond shape, and we worked together to come up with a truly unique engagement ring. In the 40+ years of his career, Dave said this was the only diamond of this shape he's ever sold (it's a kite shape). 

This was the first jewelry purchase of my life, and Dave made me extremely comfortable. He took the time to explain to me the different types of metals, how they are made, their characteristics, and basic care and repair needs, as well as information that each person should take into consideration when purchasing a diamond (cuts, clarity, etc). 

Once we came to agreement on the design, Dave set off to find the perfect stone. In less than a week he had a stone shipped to his offices and it was absolutely perfect. He called me in to check them out, and sent them off to his master jeweler to create the ring. Staring with the consultation to the day I picked up the ring, I'd say it was a total of 25-30 days. For how specific my needs were, this was WAY faster than expected and hoped for. 

Dave made an extremely nerve wracking purchasing experience seem like a trip to the grocery store. I had to be fairly sneaky about this so most of our conversations were held in person and via text. The price was extremely fair, and possibly even lower than what it should be considering rings I've seen at a similar price point that look pretty bland. I highly, highly recommend D&R House of Diamonds for all of you jewelry needs.

"Reptile department: Depressing is all I can say.  All reptiles are on loose substrate wich can cause impaction - and majority of the bedding used can get moldy quick, especially in humid conditions.  They feed crickets to herbivores (like iguanas - they eat veggies only not bugs), when veg is provided for herbivores it's always frozen mixed (corn,carrots, green beans), which has no nutritional value for the animals.  Prices for livestock are way too high.  Save yourself money and heartache, go to Reptile Rapture, they will do right by you.

Fish Department: dismal.  Fish that shouldn't be together are together, giving people new to the hobby a false impression of what is safe to put together. Aptasia is rampant in their live rock, tanks need scrubbing desperately, tanks all tied to one central filtration unit.

Bird department:  Live stock extremely overpriced, and larger birds are longing for interaction.  When they do take parrots out, most times they are on a stand behind the front counter, more or less left to their own devices.  Very little in the amount of toys are provided, birds look bored and lonely (that's why we rescued a large bird from there).  More toys need to be provided, these birds NEED enrichment, otherwise they start screaming and plucking feathers.

"Dined here for breakfast with an out of town guest, wanting specifically to have a nice Sunday breakfast downtown.

Impressions:

Pros:
1) Easy to make reservations online but entirely unnecessary for a 9:30am breakfast on this Sunday as it's not all that busy except for some soccer families.
2) The continental breakfast is good and reasonable enough -- juice, 3 pastries, fruit for 16.00.
3)  The Water pitcher is adorable -- a silver frog pitcher.  According to our server, you can purchase one through their website, though I couldn't find it there.

Cons:
1) Entire inside of this hotel is exceptionally freezing cold -- the lobby and the restaurant.  Very uncomfortable.
2) The breakfast buffet looks amazing but I'm not really in the mood to pay $30 for my breakfast no matter how good or extensive it might be.
4) A-la-carte pancakes (14.00), bacon (6.00), juice (?)  would be close to the buffet price.
5) Our totals bill with tax and tip included was $80.00 for three of us -- for breakfast?  Really? 
6) Most importantly for the 2 star rating:  My husband was ill after dining on their corned beef hash.  He mentioned that it didn't taste right but he continued to eat it and didn't return it to the kitchen, unfortunately.  He did call and let them know once we returned home.",1.0

"Came here for dim sum on a Sunday morning at around 10:30am. I thought there would be a lineup but luckily there were a few tables available. When we left at around 11:45am there was a line up. My recommendations: come early on weekends at 9am to 10:30am or arrive late at about 1:00pm or just don't bother coming at all. The parking lot is small for a dim sum place and the wait can be long if you come during peak times.

Inside is beautifully decorated. There are no words to describe and probably the nicest looking dim sum restaurant you can find in the area. 

Service was excellent and really fast. Right after we placed our order we started getting food within 5 minutes or less. Empty dishes were cleared up fast and teapots refilled quickly. 

Price is higher than the typical dim sum restaurant but its well worth it. There is no price listed on the menu and did not see any mention of early bird specials so I am assuming there is no early bird special. But based on the items we ordered: Small (S) = $3.10, Medium (M) = $4.10
Large (L) = $5.10

I usually don't review every item at a dim sum restaurant but with this place I think its worth mentioning. So here it goes.....

Tea is charged at $1.30 per person :(

1) Siu Mai ($5.10) - four super large pieces. I usually shove the whole thing in my mouth but these were so large I could not do so without looking like a pig. 

2) Scallop and spinach dumpling ($5.10) - three pieces only. Good amount of scallops. 

3) Chicken feet ($4.10) - oh so yummy. The sauce it was cooked in was done just the way I like. A hint of sweetness.

4) Papaya custard layer cake ($4.10) - soft and fluffy

5) Crispy sesame ball with egg yolk custard ($5.10) - nice and runny egg yolk custard

6) Crispy whole shrimp ($5.10) - shrimps were deep fried with a light flaky outer shell. Giant sized shrimps. Came with a mayo type dipping sauce which I could just put on anything and it would taste good.

7) Cuttlefish tentacles ($5.10) - cooked perfectly just the way I like. You can see the caramelization of the sauce on the tentacles. A hint of sweetness. The best and just as good as the ones I had at Yang's Fine Chinese Cuisine. 

8) Ham sui gok ($3.10) - deep fried outer shell was nice and crispy. The inside was soft and had huge chunks of pork meat.

9) Shrimp rice roll ($5.10) - silky smooth, soft rice rolls with giant sized shrimps.

10) Pumpkin and chestnut congee $5.10 - not too watery and not too thick but done just right. Love the addition of chestnuts in the congee.

I can say with confidence that this is probably the best money can buy in terms of dim sum. The only complaint I can find is that I wish they had more items on the menu like more variety on steamed buns. And I wish they had tofu fa (aka sweet tofu pudding). Everything tasted great. Everything tasted fresh. The ingredients they use are obviously higher quality. The only average dishes in my opinion were the papaya custard cake and the sesame ball with egg yolk. Even though they were only average to me, they were by no means a bad dish.

"The Grimaldi's franchise is NOT the same as the cozy original under the Brooklyn Bridge. Lets get that clear. They are getting 2 stars because they are supposed to live up to the Patsy Grimaldi's reputation. They use half the sauce as the original, which is aggravating because pizza at the very least is SAUCE, cheese, and dough. Since they use the real mozzarella, the cheese does not melt and cover the dough, which is fine because that's how the original is. BUT to have large portions on the pizza with NOTHING on it, its bush league. They charge something like $2 for extra sauce, and extra it is not. I wish they would not charge for extra sauce. If you ask for a side of sauce, they will bring you Calzone sauce, with chunks of meat that does not resemble the sauce that goes onto the pizza. You have to specifically ask for PIZZA SAUCE and at a cost of .001 cents to them, I have to wonder why they are so cheap about it. 

Other than this, the pizza is like the original. The service is excellent. The staff is very well trained, although it does seem to have high turnover.",1.0
I have known this business owner for a while. I am also a business owner and I refer my clients to Classic Tans all the time. I am tan naturally so I dont need a tan. LOL. But I know this. This business offers the best services of this type in Las Vegas. My clients love a good tan with a special cocktail that is Classic Tans secret sauce. One of my clients is a world class fitness model and adored the services she just received. And placed high in the fitness competition she was in. And could not stop raving about the service she received.,1.0
"My Vietnamese friend invited me today for lunch at this place, I ordered the Pho n°9 and he took the n°1. Both were really good !  I will be back for sure!  And it's also great that after you can go do your shopping in an Asian market , there are so many product that I discover today !",1.0
"Wonderful Crispy Crust!!!""

Based on a recommendation I stopped in at Otto's for pizza today. I arrived just as they opened and there were no other customers at that point. The young lady behind the counter greeted me with a smile as I entered. I could see Otto behind her by the oven, and was glad he was making my pizza today. There is no table service, so you order at the counter. I placed my order to eat there, and picked a table to sit at. 

My half Otto's Veggie and half Otto Philly pizza was brought to me fairly quickly, and it looked delicious! The toppings looked fresh, it was piping hot, and the pizza crust around the edges looked puffy, crisp and light. I decided to start with the Otto's Veggie side of the pizza.

The crust was light and crisp and thin - even at the center of the pizza! I don't recall ever having a crust like it. It was delicious! Beyond the crust, the balance of toppings was perfect, and the flavor was wonderful. When I finally ate my way to the puffy crispy crust at the edge, it was marvelous. That's the part I don't usually eat, but this was so good that I had to eat it. The Otto's Philly side of the pizza was just as good as the Veggie side, with a nice balance of toppings. 

By the time I was having my third slice, I noticed that there was a line of customers from the counter all the way back to the door. I had been so absorbed with my pizza that I hadn't noticed them. It was a good move to arrive when they first opened because there are only a few tables, and most everyone was eating there rather than ordering to go. 

With only Otto and one counter person working, I had to wait until everyone in line had placed their orders to be able to ask for a box to take the rest of my pizza with me. I think that the next time I'll ask to have it served in the box so that when I'm ready to leave, I'm all set and don't have to wait.

"The food was terrible. The waiter was nice. Restaurant was empty at 6:00 on a Saturday. Don't attempt to go here if you go gluten free! Can't say I feel good 24 hours after.  I had the lamb meatballs and rice noodles. All of it was completely over cooked and I am pretty sure it was put in a microwave. The rice noodles they replace the pasta with were soggy and I could only get two inch pieces at most on my fork, because they were so overcooked. It was in a green sauce. Not sure you could say it was cream sauce as most of it was soaked up by the noodles and it was green? Can't understand the choice of rice noodles as there so many other options of pasta that taste amazing as GF. The meatballs were completely dry and tasteless and the tomato garnish was as dry as a potato chip. Maybe an attempt at their own sun dried tomato? Not feeling this restaurant. Kids and husband had pizza flatbread that they said was Ok. My six year old had chicken fingers that could have come from a cheap diner and wouldn't eat the fries. Ice cream sandwiches down the street saved the night. Don't bother going here. So many better options a walk away in Downtown Summerlin. Can't say I didn't warn you!",1.0

Had a lager, but they tasted better out of the can which is the way they were served at the Yelp event. More of an elitist bar with a non-elitist beer selection.

"Worst vet clinic I've ever been to.. I took in my chihuahua that had a broken leg for bandage and splint changing.. The office staff was OK.. The vet seemed Like he didn't know what he was doing, he didn't even bother to request x rays from the emergency hospital I had gone to when she first broke her leg.. Anyway he went ahead and changed the bandages and he left the same splint she had on before and he added some kind of Popsicle stick on her leg to keep it straight and wrapped some more bandages over it I was in the room when he did the exam and bandage changing I did not like how he handled my little dog... In total it was $200 for sedation and bandages and he also charged me for the same splint that she already had from the previous emergency hospital visit!!! He did not put a new splint on her leg and still charged me for it unbelievable! Well like 5 days after he did the bandage change the Popsicle stick started digging into her skin causing her a wound. She was in so much pain I had to take her in the same day... Since he was the only non emergency vet that could see her the same day I took her in because I didn't want her to suffer any longer.. I walked in and he asked me what I was doing there because her next bandage changing was in 2 weeks, even though I had just spoke to him earlier on the phone explaining what was going on.. I told him to look under the bandages where he had put the Popsicle stick and when he pulled at it it stunk!!! Her skin was rotting!! He went back and rebandaged her leg but put NOTHING on the wound he didn't even clean it.. She was out of the room in litteraly 5 minutes.. I had to clean it at home and put neosporin on it I thought that was the vets job thats why I took her in!!! NEVER going there again because I care about my dog too much.

They will help you pick out just the right cigar and help you find a drink that pairs perfectly.  No one is pretentious because Fox has shattered the old stereotypes of cigar smoking.

Got a quote from Delta Mechanical to install a 40 gal. hot water heater in my garage.  $747.00!!!!  The water heater only cost $400.00.  Why would I pay almost twice as much for installation?

"I have an orange ""rescue"" tabby (Bailey) that my son found 12 years ago in a dumpster with one badly infected eye..  While living in California I had the best vet and she informed me that eventually his eye would have to be removed because he couldn't see out of it anyway.  I moved to here to Arizona 2 years ago and wasn't looking forward to the day to find a new vet but Goodyear Animal Hospital has the BEST reviews and was recommended by a friend of my son's.  Well, my cat does NOT like to be touched or held (very rarely by me in the last 12 years) but I love him anyway.  He is a difficult cat to get into the carrier - so I have to take him to have his eye examined - So to the vet I go  ---- - OH MY GOSH - the people who worked at Goodyear the BEST and most patient of all.  They carried him out of my car for me, took me immediately into a room - the technician spent 20 minutes talking to be about all Bailey's problems (psychological as well) and then Dr. Fan comes in and does the same thing - patient, kind, and listened and wasn't in a hurry to get me in and out.  The result was that Bailey needed to have his eye removed.  The cost was high but they worked with me and he had the surgery yesterday.  When I brought him in yesterday they were so good with him and explained every thing they were going to do   - and the same when I picked him up - These people love animals and it shows.  Believe me when I say I have had some really bad vets and it's hard to find a good one - much less a GREAT one.  Highly recommend them!  They will be my go to vet and for my son's pet as well.",1.0
"My husband and I decided to try the keg mansion and it turned out to not what I expected. We started with arriving a bit earlier to see if we could get in. There was a line up to speak with the host. When I was next to speak, the person behind decided to go ahead and speak to the host first. The host herself, didn't even try to attend to me first, instead wanted to help her. That really got me upset, but I decided to let it go. Everything after that was better. Mainly we were impressed with our server, Emma. She was very attentive, professional and extremely friendly. We felt she really tried to make our experience a pleasant one. Aside from that, we might come back. I suggest the hosts to step up and attend to your guests when they are in order and not pick and choose who you want to take care of.",1.0
"I SO wanted to give Evo four stars. Their food was certainly good enough for that however last night, their service was a mess. Our server, Joy, was wonderful and did everything within her power to keep things from going sideways but when another round of wine couldn't find it's way to the table (and never did) because they didn't have enough glasses, I knew we were in trouble. They had a number of larger parties there which according to Joy, contributed to the problem, but seriously - if you're running a relative hot spot in Scottsdale on a Saturday night, you should be able to handle that.

"Buffet pro tip: No matter how much you might be tempted to do so, don't fill up too much on carbs. Go for the meats and seafood dishes. That's where the money is.

Pretty good. Came around 10am on New Year's Eve morning. The lines were pretty short and we got seated pretty quickly. Our waiter was pretty friendly, although he did kinda complain a lot about the buffet being short-staffed. Oh, well, it wasn't terribly busy in the restaurant, so it wasn't all bad for him.

Onto the food. A pretty diverse selection for brunch. There were some pretty standard items like benedicts, piles of bacon, omelets, and random assorted pastries and breads, as well as an Asian station, meat station, and Italian and New American stations. My favorite dishes were the bone marrow, 5 spice pork belly, and the truffle mushroom risotto. Yes, I guess I do have a penchant for rich foods. Moreover, the dessert station was likely the most impressive, since there were all sorts of cakes, tarts, and even gelato.

My friend who has relatives who work at the Cosmopolitan said that the Wicked Spoon was one of the first Vegas buffets to portion out certain dishes instead of leaving out a huge serving dish, which in turn, saved the casino a lot of money. I think that's actually a pretty slick improvement, but sometimes you just want that adrenaline rush you get from placing a huge pile of smoked salmon onto your buffet plate. That's what Vegas is all about, isn't it?

Overall, a very good buffet. I still think I like the layout and diversity of the Bellagio buffet better, but definitely a quality buffet on the strip. I'll have to try it for dinner sometime and see what other offerings they have. Since the desserts are pretty quality here, if you have a bit of a sweet tooth, you should come here over the other buffets.",1.0

The Double Helix is a great lounge for both snackers and whiskey lovers alike. This spot is located in the main hub of Town Square and they feature over one hundred whiskeys and an entire vineyard's worth of wines, both red and white.  

Instead of just staring at their vast drink menu, I suggest going with a ""drink flight"", this is the best way to find out exactly what you do and don't like and yes, they offer whiskey and wine flights for the indecisive person. They also have great happy hour deals that usually highlight a specialty whiskey or wine. If you really want to get educated on whiskey ask for Kyle, one of the bartenders, he's the hunky guy in the Kilt. The dude is legit when it comes to drink suggestions and whiskey anecdotes. 

Hummus, quesadillas, and fried cheese is just a small sample of the snacks they offer here, they also have excellent charcuterie plates to go with that bold red in your hand.

"So disappointed in the service. They have teenagers running the shop. When I went in to look for a cake for my husband and they had no suggestions.  When I asked to sample the cake I wanted to purchase she told me they could not. How do you expect to have customers spend 40 bucks on a cake but can not sample it. I'll stick with kreative cupcakes from now on!!! 

So this is the managers response. ( captioned below) They only had two selections for men one football cake and one golf! The manager was is the back of the store but claims he over heard the conversation. The young lady stated they sample cakes every hour and they also have mini cakes as well so why not sample a small price of cake for a paying customer. $ 40.00 is already pricy to not taste the cake you are going to purchase. Seem like their customer service model needs some work. Also I am not sure what ""private for now"" but ok lol 
The proper response should have been ""I would love for you to try our amazing cakes. let me know when you are available to come in so I can make sure that cake is on sample."" ( but like I said need more training on customer service skills) 

""Hello KS
I recall your visit very well as I was sitting at my desk behind the cafe doors when you visited and thus I overheard the entire exchange. As you know, but neglected to comment in your review, you were offered a sample to try, but you declined because it was not the flavor you wanted. You were treated kindly and with respect by our GSR and offered multiple options for your husbands cake. Also, as I am far from a teenager in age and was there, I know teenagers are not running the shop. I was the person you spoke with when you called back to complain. At that time, I also apologized for your experience but tried to explain why we can't sample more than one flavor at a time. As I see this, for the simple reason that we only sample one cake flavor at a time and it didn't happen to be the flavor you wanted to try, you have chosen to give an intentionally harmful and distorted review. People love our cakes because it is simply the best cake they have ever had and our GSRs always treat our guests kindly, respectfully and with warmth. Having said that, I also know we won't please everyone so I sincerely hope you find what you're looking for elsewhere. I will leave this response to you private for now.",1.0
"I am changing my review to reflect my experience now that I've lived here for over a year. 

Property management (3rd company since late 2014) is indifferent at best. 

At worst, they lose packages, blame the owner for lack of follow through instead of taking responsibility, and conveniently forget to place work orders. 

It took them a year and a half to complete the remodel of the gym, but they charge you a $50 deposit fee for the treadmill fob. This is a small example of the greedy price gouging the complex has implemented after forcing residents to wait to remodel the gym for over a year and a half and blaming the sluggishness on the owner's failure to make decisions in a timely manner. 

If a tenant moves out of your building, your building is stuck with the empty apartment's remaining water bill. You pay for the landscaping once summer hits...your water bill explodes.  We pay for security, but I've never seen them on site. Neighbors are ill mannered and loud. You often have to park in a completely different lot due to poor planning and parking allotment. 

Apartments are nice, but everything is installed incorrectly (tubs are backwards, faucets are backwards) and not upgraded to reflect the model. Cheap, penny pinching fixes for residents. Kitchens are AWFUL to clean if you don't have an upgraded one. Do NOT get a kitchen with white tile or white counters (counters are completely impossible to clean). 

Ice cream truck comes in every single day and blocks traffic while blaring obnoxious music. When asked to disallow this, management will tell you they've never heard a complaint before and that they will ""try to have them come around less"" while doing literally nothing about it aside from the lip service....which is frankly offensive at this point. Just tell me to buggar off like a person with an ounce of integrity would. It would be a refreshing change of pace in this slumlord complex, plastic smile management.  

When you first move in, you MAY think all the small problems are worth it. After a year, management's lack of giving a shit really shines through proudly. Owner is an llc derived from another llc, ownership reaching as far back as Europe...practically impossible to reach for action. Sending letters to their lawyer- Gregg Vermeys at vermeysg@gtlaw.com is probably the best method of action, as management is untrustworthy and unreliable.

I've been a loyal customer for almost 20 years and have been to over 30 locations over the country and have never experienced such poor customer service.   I now work across the street from this location and have walked in on three different occasions and each time I go in for something specific and the item is out or stock.  You would think the sales associate would ask if there's anything else I need or at least try and ask if I'm willing to try another mascara (for example) but no.

"Do not eat here if you must avoid gluten. In my experience, it seems this restaurant, like so many others, advertises gluten free options, but the preparation is not safe for those with celiac disease who must avoid gluten for health reasons -- not for a fad diet reasons. I went to Kabuki on 7\/14\/15 for HH with friends. Prior to going, I called ahead to speak with the staff about how foods were prepared in a safe way for celiacs. The staff member said all the right things, but that's the only happy part of this story. The first bad sign was that my server had never heard of gluten, and he looked unconcerned when I asked him to ask the chef to prepare my roll with a clean knife and cutting board and bamboo mat to avoid cross-contamination. And apparently that didn't happen, because I got very sick afterwards. The food always tastes good, and the HH is cheap, but it's not worth the short-term pain and perhaps long-term health ramifications if you're a celiac.",1.0
"What a horrific end to a mediocre weekend getaway at the SLS Las Vegas Hotel and Casino. My boyfriend and I decided to stay at the SLS for the weekend to celebrate his birthday, him being signed to a manager, and my passing of an important test. We picked the SLS because we wanted to be a little further away from the Strip, it looked modern and chic, and most importantly the price was right. 

The SLS Las Vegas has lost $35 million dollars in their first quarter and now it's apparent as to why. There were things about the hotel that weren't ideal, but that could be overlooked while we were there. 1.) The shower didn't drain. 2.) Our room key didn't work at one point. 3.) The fact that while being out of our room for numerous hours, and coming back at 5PM, and still finding out that our room still hadn't been cleaned. 4.) The rude security guard at the Foxtail Pool who mocked me for asking a simple question. ALL of these things I was able to forgive, however, after what happened in my last hour, I cannot overlook the hotel's blatant inadequacies any more. 

While parked in THEIR hotel's garage, I went back to my car and noticed that not only had my car's back window been completely shattered, but that our stuff had been stolen. When talking to hotel security, I was then told that they had no security cameras in their garage. Mind you, Las Vegas hotels spend exorbitant amounts of money on security cameras and guards. For example, when entering their pool area, my boyfriend and I were stopped by a security guard asking us for our room key and IDs, and then right after, another security guard prompting us to empty our pockets and ready to physically search us. There were at least 10 security guards at the pool alone. HOWEVER, they only had one security guard riding around on bike in the hotel's garage where their ""respected"" guests park. Clearly, their money and property is more important than their guests.  

Instead of them trying to help me (offer me a ride to the police station, escort me to a room to make necessary phone calls, comp my stay, help me clean the glass away from my car's path, offering a sincere apology, etc) they let me know that I parked at their parking garage at my own risk and that they were not accountable AT ALL. Which I get. I do. I trusted a well-known hotel with my car. I was wrong to trust the SLS, and honestly neither should you. 

After reporting this crime, I have yet to hear from a hotel representative to see how me, my boyfriend, or my car is doing, and I doubt I will. I spent a lot of money at this hotel, and was a good guest, the least they could do is show me the same amount of respect. But perhaps that's asking too much. I have never been so insulted in all my life. It's one thing if this happened at a Motel 6, but this happened at a well respected, well-known hotel- SLS Las Vegas, you could've fooled me. Next time, I'll just take my chances and stay at a Motel 6, I'm sure it would be worth the risk.

The room smelled damp and reeked of cigarette smoke. It was extremely chilly even after turning on the heat for a while. The mini-bar was not stocked and the paint on the ceiling beams was peeling. We decided there had to be a better room based on the price we were paying. Turns out there was.

"I can't say that my exotic meat was a 5-star experience in terms of entrees, however the foie gras was certainly good.

Overall, food wise I would probably have to give this place a 3-star. It didn't impress me much and it was fairly pricey. 

That being said, the view is absolutely amazing. Come during sunset, you will not believe some of the photos I was able to capture! The height of this restaurant along with its sort of 360ish view really gives you this amazing experience of seeing the smaller Toronto city airport, and all the high rises and the amazing colors during a sunset.

"I am updating my rating from 4 to 5 stars for 5th and Wine.  I have been here many, many times since I first reviewed the restaurant.  The consistency of excellent service, the thoughtful rotation of fine wines at value prices (especially during happy hour 3 PM - 6 PM), and the wide range of fantastic food have me totally sold on this place. In my prior review I gave them 4 stars because I was not a fan of the live music on Thur, Fri and Sat evenings.  The music is decent, but still not my personal favorite.  But the staff, wine selection and food far outweigh my small personal preference.  Plus, the limited seating wine dinners are the best in town thanks to creative complex food dishes paired amazingly with each wine offered by a guest winery-of-the-month.  It is usually 4 courses with liberal wine pours.  It is an upscale wine dinner, but with non-pretentious people and always a lot of fun.  Cheers!",1.0

I wanted to have hair removed from my underarms and so I came over, filled out my paperwork and when I was done, Anahit went through them. I was impressed. Most places ask you to fill out the paperwork but don't really bother reading them. Anahit read the things that I wrote down, asked me some questions about it and told me what she thought. She said that they just recently opened and would love to take my money if I decide to get the service done anyway but she said that she would rather send me away and not do the procedure at all. She explained that typically it takes at least 6-8 visits and then 6 weeks in between visits for most body parts to be treated again because that's how long hair grows back and that was something that I had to seriously consider. She also explained the impact of hormones in hair growth. Anahit and Mari are both very knowledgeable and helpful. These days, it's hard to find people who genuinely care and don't just wanna take your money. They are new in the business and I think that they will be very successful and I wish them all the best for their future! Cheers!",1.0

The waiter was super attentive and friendly, and he helped us from step one throughout the whole meal. (Since it was our first hotpot experience, we could use some guidance)  I like spicy food, so I wanted to try the hot broth. There are three levels of the hot broth; mild, suicide, killer spicy. I chose suicide level, and it has good flavor and numbness but as a spicy loving person, I should have ordered killer spicy.  Later I learned we could have asked for more paste for spicier broth if you want more kick. We tried all the meat, veggies and other selections they have, and my favorite was sliced beef, watercress, bean curd, and vermicelli. They also have a good sauce corner, lots to choose from.  It was overall a very fun and fulfilling experience.  We loved it and want to go back again.  It is also pretty close from the Art Gallery of Ontario, and I strongly recommend going to AGO, and then visit this place as we did, and you will not regret it.",1.0

"First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!

The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu.

The mains we got were the rabbit rigatoni, the spaghetti w\/ clams and sausage, and one vegetarian dish, the agnolotti.

I said (which shouldn't have been necessary) that I wanted to buy gas, she then asked if I wanted to use a Debit Card (again, this should've been obvious), I said ""OK, I just want to buy gas"".

"Now this review is based on benchmarking Talking Stick against other casinos taking into account this isn't Vegas

First Talking Stick people, if your going to say your a destination place, and offer live music, how about having more than 30 sole seats and about only 10 tables.  So no where to sit remotely close, no problem I'll just find another lounge.

Wait a minute, there seems to be a shortage of lounges or any other type of live music.  How about just another place to sit and chill?  Walked around and only seen a short row of booths with small tables across from Ocean Trail.

Ocean Trail did you say?  Yes stood in line for 25 minutes with no acknowledgement from any staff.  Finally asked for $18.75 for gumbo, which I can't ever seem to recall anyone anywhere charging that much, I asked if all the gumbo and étouffée was made today.  Staff member wasn't sure.  So congrats but I won't stand in line for 25 minutes, pay $18.00 for gumbo that might not have fresh seafood that day.  Just had a cocktail and moved on.

So heard there was a night club on the 15th floor with live music.  Off again and find the elevators.  Two door guys and a security guard maybe didn't understand that being my first time here, I asked for the lounge that had music.  Three questions later, are you eating?  No drinking!  Where did you want to go?  Beats the hell out of me, refer to first answer.  Here for Sky something or Orange Crush? Hmmm, again great question if I knew what either place was.  So they said go up to the 15th floor.  Basically wound up on the 14th floor, security person asks for my bracelet?  (Seriously?). Bracelet for liquor laws- sure here is my ID.  Trust me I look 21 years over 21.  Nope having an ID wasn't good enough I guess.  Another example of making your policies more important than a guest trying to just have a drink at your bar.  I'll go back down guys And I'll go down to the parking garage and I'll keep going!

Lastly, charge a decent amount for drinks but don't just throw it together and not really care about the flavor of the drink.  I asked for a Jack D that didn't have to much coke and to make sure I taste the Jack.  Did the bartender really try to do anything different than measure which seemed a tad short of Jack and squirted way to much Coke in the glass?  Nope

Okay, so no real entertainment, overpriced food and substandard drinks.  Add in that no one really cares about the customers over their rules\/regulations that I've never seen in any other casino- it adds up to just going somewhere else.",1.0
"Oh Angry Crab Shack, God bless you!!! I will be brutally honest and say that I was not a huge fan of the Mesa location for plenty of reasons (LOCATION, inconsistent taste\/spice levels of the sauces, price) however we kept coming back to get our seafood boil fix because of the lack of this type of restaurant here. It slowly grew on us as the recipe kept improving. And by the time THIS location opened, it has been perfected! Yay! My family came in on day 2 of the opening and was pleasantly surprised to be seated within 5 minutes. Hallelujah! I celebrated my new job here and there was no better place I would have rather been. Our server was a total sweetheart. So attentive and charismatic as are almost all the servers we get when we come in. We don't come in without several pounds of shrimp in Trifecta sauce (mild or medium). The shrimp are sizable compared to their competition. The clams are always good as well but sometimes we can skip it if we don't want to go too crazy... because of course we HAVE to get the BBQ... Oh my goodness... Their brisket is SUPERB. ACQ sauce mild is the way to go. I think now their BBQ dishes comes with 2 choices of meat and we have tried their ribs but I highly recommend sticking with double brisket. BBQ also comes with 2 sides but we ALWAYS opt to substitute for cajun fries. Oh those fries... careful because you won't be able to stop eating them. We've had to get additional orders of those fries on more than 1 occasion. We have come here on weekends and weekdays on all sorts of different hours of the day but NEVER had to wait more than 5 minutes on a table. The place is huge, much bigger than the Mesa location.

"Let me start by saying I hate to leave a bad review.   For me to leave a bad review, something very egregious must have happened, or something not quite so bad must have happened several times. In this case, it is the latter.  I have been to this restaurant several times, so my experiences reflect multiple bad encounters. 

Before I get into the bashing, I'd like to state the only reason I have been back here after my first time, was at the promptings of friends. And I will indulge them as they are my friends and the quality of food is not bad. The few times I have been here, I have found the food to be enjoyable. However, the service has always been mediocre at best.

This last particular trip, however, will be my last.  Let me set the stage to start.  The place was not busy when we arrived, and it appeared at least half the lights were off.  I like natural light over harsh fluorescent, so this is not a complaint.  However, about halfway through the meal, all the lights came back on and the vents fired up with a loud ""Woosh!""  It was like that scene from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I though I was going to get sucked up through the vent.  But my real complaint here last night was the service, it  was beyond horrible!  We were seated quickly and the table was set with the side dishes just fine.  Our order was taken, with some confusion, but once we were all on the same page, it was delivered timely.  It was some time later though before anyone stopped by again to check on us.  It was so long in fact, I turned off the grill as little pieces of whatever started burning on the grill.  I ordered more bulgogi, and it seemed like forever before some measly portion was finally delivered.  The lady plopped it down on the grill, then seemed annoyed it was turned off.  Once the grill started heating back up, I took to arranging the meat neatly and evenly around the grill.  Of course, I quickly ran out of the sesame oil and patiently waited for someone to stop by and check on us.  That never happened.  There was a table of Korean people seated next to us, who were seated after us, that the wait staff, and a lady who appeared to be in charge, where tripping over themselves to attend to.  It was actually comical how we were being annoyed.  After many many attempts to make eye contact, my wife actually spoke up with a loud voice to a passing server asking for someone to stop by.  That was met by a blank stare, and still,no one ever came.  

We ended up standing up and walking to the register.  Had my family not been in tow, I would have simply walked out.  I complained to the lady I assumed was the manager.  She rang us up as I was complaining, said she was sorry and told me the total.  I don't think she could have cared less!  I made a point to put a 0 (zero) on the tip line and signed the receipt.  

To be fair, had this terrible dining experience not happened last night (I decided to sleep on this before taking to Yelp), I would not have ever reviewed this place.  But since I am on a roll, I will give it a review outside of my experience last night.

I like KBBQ, and although I have not tried them all, I have tried a few places and have enjoyed some more than others.  Here is my review of Woonam Jung Lee's Korean BBQ.

At Woonam Jung, you order your meats with the servers, and then they bring the meat to you. I have a couple friends that like this place because it is not ""self serve"", and they perceive this as being more sanitary.  

Side dishes are plentiful, and are presented in a visually appealing and appetizing way.  They have a papaya one that is very hot and amazing delicious.

However, although I have been here a few times because friends wanted to go here, it is not my go to place and would not choose this place on my own.  

First, even though the food is fine, the service is so bad that it does not make it worth the trip!   I mean, service is consistently bad.  And looking over other reviews, I am not alone.  Service always has been good when you first walk in, but follow up service is non-existent.  

I like the self-serve style KBBQ places.  I can get exactly what I want, and exactly how much I want.  No waiting for a server to drop by and take my order, then wait to have it delivered.  

I like the sesame oil with salt and pepper.  At Woonam Jung, they bring you such a small amount that  I usually have to ask for more several times.  I also like the garlic and  jalapeno peppers.  Again, they bring such a small amount I have to ask several times for more.  I understand they are probably trying to avoid waste, but the small amounts they offer comes off as stingy.      

Overall, the service is so consistently bad it overshadows anything good or unique about this place.  I have tried to like this place, but unfortunately it is not happening for me.  And given my last experience there, can honestly say I will never go back.",1.0
"I love bingo and playing at Red Rock is no exception!

"I will never recommend unless you yourself are  inebriated  ... Absolutely terrible service. I don't care if it's late night or not.

In short, the range is decent but the staff will treat you like an absolute inconvenience to them. They will be rude, condescending, contradict themselves and generally leave you feeling like a trespasser who paid a fee. The facility itself is a 4 star, the staff deserve a -3. Seriously, the staff is so rude my wife - an Air Force veteran so no stranger to guns btw - refuses to go because of the RO's.

Want more details? 

Here's the good:

Large facility, well maintained, large variety of ranges and events, safe, one fee no time limit.

Here's the bad:

90% of the RSO's are incredibly rude and unhelpful. There's a couple nice guys, but most will treat you like you were trespassing in their yard and shooting, rather than like a paying customer. 

There are not enough shields to catch brass for each station on the main range, so you're going to get showered. 

In order to qualify to use the other ranges like long range or pistol bays you must shoot a whole bunch of matches (no one will ever give you a straight answer - small bore was 3 for me, pistol is like 20 but no one will tell you this)

Even as a member, when asking any sort of questions as to qualifying you'll get the whole ""Go ask him, go ask her, no ask him"" nonsense. The. You will be treated like crap for asking questions as if you interrupted a family dinner.

Once you have those other range privileges, you will not be given ANY direction or expectations. You will, however, be screamed at by a rude RO for an arbitrary infraction - case in point - I was sighting in my pistol at about 9 yards. I was using a target stand that was on the ground already, instead of the ones buried in the dirt. An RO came over and freaked out and made me feel like I was shooting at other people and how I was supposed to know I was not allowed to do that. #1 Why was the stand there then? #2 Why was I not given ANY information at all? #3 Why at the rimfire match which qualified me ON THAT RANGE was a repeatedly engaging targets as close as 5 YARDS??? 

No one responds to their emails. Each division has a director who you are supposed to be able to contact. I have never ONCE received a reply to a question regarding procedure, rules, etc.

I get it that these guys must get frustrated dealing with dummies who don't listen, like seriously, ""Don't touch guns during ceasefire"" is pretty easy to understand but EVERY single time some idiot gets yelled at.

"My husband and I dined at this restaurant last night while we were in Vegas and have nothing but good to say about the restaurant, the service, the food, the drinks and most if all the compassion of all of the staff that were working last night.  We had a very unusual experience and the entire staff came together to help us out. 

It was our last night and we wanted to ensure that we dined at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants before returning home. We are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay.  We had just selected our food and drinks when my husband had a sudden nosebleed and had to leave to go to the washroom.  The drinks came.... I placed our order........the food came.......I tried to eat  my chopped pub salad (which was delicious).....and my husband still wasn't back.  Our server VERY discretely asked if everything was ok and when I explained the situation he offered to go check on him.  He alerted his Supervisor who also discreetly offered assistance.  After 45 minutes, when the medical situation was under control we thanked our server and as we were getting ready to leave the Manager also came by to ensure that everything was under control before we left.  The restaurant was very busy but the Manager spent considerable time to make us feel comfortable and valued.

"Stopped by Ajo Al's with family while visiting them in Scottsdale.  Convenient location right off the 101 freeway.  Small parking lot.  Seating was prompt at dinner time and we had a great server who really stayed on top of things.  Atmosphere was casual, but a little dated and the main room was a bit noisy.  We did enjoy the various masks and southwestern appointments around the room.  Food was ""par for the course""...  very average and essentially what you get from most other Mexican food restaurants throughout the valley.  Margaritas tasted nice and fresh.  Jalapeno Bean Dip was like a bowl of melted cheese with beans thrown in for color, but still tasted ""ok"".  Only complaint would be that my ""Chimichanga"", which is essentially a deep-fried burrito, came out way undercooked and the tortilla was exceptionally doughy.  Apart from that, the rest of the food was spot-on, the portions were big and Ajo Al's proved to be a good, although very average Mexican food joint.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  If you're in the area, give it a try!",1.0

The iced toddy was delicious. you have the option of drinking it out of a cold mason jar for the same price as a small, and that made it retain it's coldness. I got the last green chile pork empanada. It was awesome!  Flaky crust and the meat inside was flavorful and moist even though it was under a heat lamp. I tried my mother-in-law's blueberry muffin (read: ate half of) and that was really good too. She loved her latte.

They allow you to dress up your coffee with organic sugar cane syrup at the creamer station. At first I was bummed they didn't offer flavors (I love vanilla iced toddies) but the coffee is so good you don't need to distract yourself from that authenticity with artificial flavoring. A dash of sugar cane syrup gave me the sweetness I craved just fine.

"I come from Texas and understand the concept pizza place for kids to enjoy. Chuck E Cheese was our go to place in Houston. Now we are in AZ and this was the closest, same type of establishment, where we live. NEVER AGAIN! Sorry but the game room was way too small, no games for ages under 4-5 yo and it took 55 minutes for one large pizza to be ready. 

I do not expect this to be in any way or form good pizza. I had higher hopes though looking at the set up in the prep area. We ordered the regular 3 Cheese with pepperoni on thin crust. There was way too much sauce which made the crust soft and soggy and I will not even mention the grease....(oh sorry. I just did).

I do have one main complaint. My last time I was served here.My waiter seemed confused as to what I was saying as if I had a hearing problem. I asked for pepper for my chicken soup, and he thought I said the opposite.

He then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. He never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. For instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.

Unfortunately, I do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair.

"I have lived here for almost two years.  I wish I had moved out at the expiration of my lease but there was a lot of effort required at a time when I was traveling extensively for work.  Now I am locked into a 14 month lease (weird length) at a time when there have been some changes that make life here more difficult.

Before criticizing, I should say that the maintenance crew is fantastic.  They are responsive usually within 1-2 hours and they always get the issue resolved.

The main problem is the office staff and the ""Camden"" policies. The latest change is that they no longer accept packages through the mail.  If your package doesn't fit in your mailbox, you have to pick it up at the local post office which is not convenient.  

Another Camden policy that recently occured locks you into Cox Communication cable TV and the package that the apartment complex wants you to have.  Cox is obviously not the best cable or internet that you can get but Camden gets their kickbacks.

Camden does have a trash service that comes by during the week at 9PM.  Heaven help you if have your trash out before 6PM though.  Also, on the weekends and holidays, there is no trash pickup.  That being the case, you would think there would places to throw trash, such as dumpsters.  Nope.  I have been unable to find any place to throw garbage outside of the normal trash times.

Finally, and most importantly, the office staff is awful.  They have recently changed mangers and I haven't had an opportunity yet to interact with her, but the previous group was difficult.  They were very rarely in the office which poses a problem if you actually need to speak with someone in person or over the phone.  They tell you to send an email but that doesn't necessarily handle situations where a discussion needs to occur.  They are more interested in trying to fill their vacancies rather than making their existing customers happy.  Maybe there wouldn't be as many vacancies if they had better customer service.

Located on Craig Road in North Las Vegas, and part of a small chain featuring the slogan ""Where the Big Boys Eat,"" it was largely on a whim that I decided to visit Lumberjacks Restaurant en route to an early showing of The Avengers at Galaxy Theaters and although the bloated movie was more than a little disappointing the breakfast served amidst log cabin décor was far better than rumors or reviews would have it, even if portions didn't really seem all that large to someone sporting a pretty good appetite despite his deceiving frame.

Cleverly themed, but far less 'branded' than Hash House a Go Go or Black Bear Diner...or any restaurant under the Daniel Boulud banner, to be fair...guests arriving at Lumberjacks are greeted by the large statue of a hirsuit woodsman out front and upon entering by 'yes sir\/yes ma'am' service plus a large case of cakes and pies, an ""ultimate burger bar"" with tables flanking it on both sides before an open kitchen to their rear.

Offering options of breakfast, lunch, and dinner with almost the entire menu available throughout regular business hours, it was with little hesitation that I flipped directly to the section labeled griddles and after a few questions about what was featured in the pastry case my order essentially wrote itself, a request to have items sent out as they were ready resulting in two courses served over the course of forty-five minutes during which only inaccessible ""free"" WiFi and having to repeatedly request coffee refills marred an otherwise pleasant stay.

Homey in design, with tables and chairs set peripherally as banquets and booths lined the middle of the room, it was in a sort of alcove that I sat and within only ten minutes of ordering I was in the midst of sugaring my second cup of coffee when my dessert-as-appetizer arrived, the plate described as ""deep fried bread pudding"" proving to be a sort of devilish mashup somewhere between traditional custard soaked brioche and an apple fritter with a crispy golden exterior gilded by glistening caramel plus a sidecar of custard lightly tinged with booze. 

Almost certain that neither my entrée nor a housemade biscuit would trump the bread pudding in decadence, quality, or inspiration it was nonetheless to a large plate of proteins and carbs that I was treated next and although my assumptions would indeed be born out as none but the nutty banana bread with a gently seared exterior was particularly memorable it wasn't as though any of the options was particularly 'bad,' just standard run-of-the-mill breakfast fare served at a good price with both flapjacks and French Toast happy to sop up pure maple syrup ported from home while the large biscuit was piping hot and flaky with ample notes of buttermilk beneath whipped butter and honey, both.

Setting aside the out-of-the-way location and service that was far less attentive than would be expected from a restaurant less than a quarter full, Lumberjacks Restaurant is comparable to spots like The Cracked Egg, Egg Works, Mr. Mama's, Jamms', and several others in terms of price, quality, and portions - the deep fried bread pudding amongst the very finest examples in The Valley, and something I'd suggest justifying the thirty minute trip North.",1.0

Visited phoenix first time and decided to visit this sushi restaurant based on others review. Definitely a good sushi restaurant. Quality tasting fish and not fishy at all. Portions are generous. I ordered 5 piece nigiri plate w\/ roll and gf order spider crab roll. Highly recommend the nigiri plate for those who enjoy raw fish and dislike eating imitation crab\/fried ingredients. The raw fish was served well thawed that it tasted creamy ( cuz we all sushi eater should know that raw fish must be frozen first to kill bacteria and thawed enough that you can taste the full texture and flavor of the fish w\/o the fishy flavor). The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura which was delicious.

"Second stop and wait for an eternity. I went next door. Ordered food. Got my order and came back. Still waiting. They lost their second star. Same rude teller slash cashier method. 

Tastes great. Very filling for a combo. Everything else needs improvement. The server interrupted me and didn't answer my questions. She was more worried about the name for the order. If its an obligation technique it didn't work on the old lady behind me. She laughed and said this place was over priced. It was awkward and unnecessary to rudely ask my name for an order I haven't placed yet. Then I waited twenty minutes for my food.  I do have places to be. Its supposed to be a wing stop. Not a rooster-nest. Yes they are clean and friendly but awkward, expensive and slow. I'll check back in again to see if the wait, server was a fluke. The prices don't seem like they will change anytime soon.

Came by to try their smothered fried chicken with my friend. Took note that it takes 20 minutes for them to get it out the kitchen to us.

"For all the thin crust lovers out there, this is your place! For the deep dishers...you probably will not enjoy this place.  The crust is perfectly crisp and thin, with a nice crunch with each bite.  This is like the subway of pizza...you go down the line and pick your items. For $8 you can put ANY TOPPING on your pizza and as much of it as you want!  The service is amazingly fast, with the pizza coming out in less than 10 minutes. I mean really, where can you find such an offer?!  I opted for two sauces on mine, herb butter first and then alfredo on top.  But really, you can split the pizza in half and have two totally different sauces....the options are limitless.  I can't remember the exact combo of all the veggies and meats I put on there, since I got a little greedy and picked almost everything.  Like other reviews, yes they are a little skimpy with the ingredients at first, but I just asked them to put more of whatever I wanted.  They were happy to oblige, without any complaints.  The only one minor issue I had was with the sausage.  I like Italian sausage with a little pepper\/heat, but the sausage here seems a little bland.  I honestly can't wait to come back, thin crust pizza is my favorite and now I can have it my way every time, without paying extra for each additional topping!",1.0
"Dr. Joe and Chris have been an amazing resource for my recently adopted puppy and me.

They took him the day I called for potential kennel cough when UW and several other vets couldn't squeeze him in until the following week. Eastside had a jammed schedule, but they made the space to see my pup, regardless. The entire visit ended up as an entire checkup, and we resumed the vaccine schedule where the Humane Society left off.

Since then, I have returned for another check up and for some boosters on the vaccines. Dr. Joe and Chris take their time in explaining pet medicine and biology in detail but an easy to understand manner. I appreciate the extra effort it takes to explain a complex biochemical system to laymen. Thank you for keeping your pet owners knowledgeable!

Dr. Joe also handled a frantic call I made regarding blood in vomit. Everyone knows that blood in vomit and stool can be quite bad. He calmed me down, and we were able to figure out the pup had cut himself on a toy just over the phone. I found the evidence. He could have had me come into the clinic and charged $35 just to walk in the door, but instead time was taken out to provide a free consult over the phone. I very much appreciate all of this effort!

"My dad passed away in October of 2013 less than 24 hours after being released from Heath South on Valley View.

I had written a letter to the Health South management team a few months after he passed. Here we are a year and a half later and they are just now calling me back. Talk about adding insult to injury. I have returned the call from them and left them a voicemail. I haven't spoken with anyone yet but the annoying phone tag and extreme delay to my letter has finally motivated me to make this public. Hopefully this will help other families make the right choice in what facility they choose for their loved ones rehab services. 

To get us to how rehab even came about-- My dad was fighting colon cancer that had spread to his spine. He began experiencing difficulty walking, getting to the restroom, or even rolling over in bed. I scheduled an emergency appointment with his oncologist and showed up with my brother and not my dad so we could have a serious talk with his doctor. This was his fourth battle with this disease and the doctor really seemed to look at him as a lost cause. My brother and I were struggling to care for him, were not doctors! We were 21 and 23 year old kids! During this appointment, he told us my dad needed to go to rehab to learn to walk again and after three hours of trying to convince my dad to go to Health South as his doctor directed, he finally agreed. At this point he wasn't all there mentally and the doctor knew this based on his one on ones with my dad as well as the information my brother and I had provided to him (we were his care takers with the help of two visits per week from a nurse that would take vitals, etc.). My dad gets into rehab and they literally put him in the last room at the end of the hallway, I'd say we saw the nurses about twice a day in the three days he was there. On 10\/28\/13 a nurse told us he was ""refusing"" to do the rehab tasks they needed him to do. In reality, the cancer had completely taken over his spine and he was incapable of even trying to walk. He also had radiation damage (his lower back was black from radiation). This nurse also told us that he needs hospice not rehab but that she couldn't recommend that because she isn't a doctor (OK? So you're going to just let this fly?). It was about 7 pm on the same day 10\/28\/13 when a male nurse came in and I asked him for the supervisors information who he said would return the following morning. I wanted to talk to her and get him released to a hospice as soon as possible so he would at least pass comfortably. He reluctantly gives up her information and starts checking on my dad. I told him, ""It sounds like he is drinking out of an empty soda can with a straw when he breathes"", I now know this is called ""the death rattle"". He said he would let the doctor know and sends me on my way as it was 8:30 pm and ""visiting hours"" were ending. I'm sorry but if you think a patient needs hospice, you think they are dying-- you shouldn't kick their family members out if you think they may only have a limited amount of time left. On my way out I see a gentleman with ""respiratory therapist"" on his name tag and of course I stop him and tell him my dad's breathing doesn't sound right and asked him to go check on him. An hour after I leave, I get a call saying my dad was being rushed to Mountain View hospital and I needed to get there (I'm assuming the respiratory therapist stepped up and told them to call an ambulance). 10 minutes after that I get a call saying they had to re-route and take him to a closer hospital, Valley hospital. We get there and the ER doctor tells us he has the worst case of pneumonia she has seen in her 5 years of being at Valley hospital. Tell me why a rehab with an ONSITE RESPIRATORY THERAPIST couldn't figure out that he had THE WORST CASE OF PNEUMONIA AN ER DOC HAS SEEN IN 5 YEARS?!?!?!?! He also had septicemia among other things caused by the cancer. He passed away 21 hours later.

I understand the oncologist made the wrong choice sending him to rehab.. but HEALTH SOUTH ALSO MADE THE WRONG CHOICE ACCEPTING HIM AS A PATIENT. They have a responsibility to say, ""NO-- THIS PATIENT IS DYING AND NEEDS HOSPICE!"" But instead they took him on as a patient and in my opinion kept him as long as they could without him dying on their watch-- all for the money. The quality of care is terrible, the guest\/customer\/patient service they provide is terrible, and frankly the fact there isn't a supervisor there at night is downright irresponsible. When I drive by this place, even the other locations, I tear up every time. My dad was the best dad and the best friend anyone could ask for. People in healthcare should treat every patient like they would want their own loved ones to be treated in a time of need.",1.0

"I've been going to this dentist for about 5 years. 

Most of the times I go there (2x year + sometimes a 3rd time per year) I feel the exact same way as L.M.'s review on 1\/27\/2014. I never thought to review Dr. Peters on Yelp because I really believe in giving small businesses a chance- even several chances - before publicly giving a ""meh"" review. Sadly, I am reviewing now with a 1-star review only to say buyer beware.

Both I and a professional staff member at Warner Village Cosmetic and Family Dentistry have recently been working hard at getting some healthcare\/insurance information straightened out for a day guard Dr. Peters recommended for my severe bruxism. The staff member was extremely patient and friendly in trying to explain complicated dental insurance to me. She told me that bottom line there are no guarantees in price because of the way Dental health Insurance companies work. She suggested I call BCBSAZ to feel more comfortable in the numbers. I agreed that was a good idea. No harsh words were ever exchanged in this dental office by the staff or by me. 

Fair enough; I called BCBSAZ to get the real numbers from them. BCBSAZ patiently explained it all to me - and it took about 30 minutes and multiple calculations to explain. Fine with me, becuase yes, dental insurance is quite complex. 

Next step was calling back the dental office to basically report ""yes, let's do the appointment since I now have the price from the source. I told the nice employee that oddly enough, the price I got was a bit different from your price (which neither of us could figure out, but that's ok - I wasn't mad - it was just information that made us go ""huh.""; and I also reported that ""oh, yes, I asked BCBSAZ about a dental claim that was unpaid that you asked me to ask them about when I called them. BCBSAZ told me that they haven't received it but that they received a different amount claim for the same person on the same day from this provider."" 

My intentions were purely to inform and follow up with what they asked me to do. I wasn't mad; the employee didn't seem mad. She said she would have the insurance person follow up with me via email. No problem for me - that's typical in business. 

I'm not sure what went wrong. Next thing I know (within 1 day), I received an emailed, signed PDF\/letter from Dr. Peters that basically said in about 4 paragraphs that since I have lost trust in her clinical skills and her staff, she doesn't find this relationship productive and that she will not treat me anymore. Wow. You be the judge.",1.0
"CHANDLER: YOUR COFFEE UPGRADE IS HERE!

Phoenix has a long history of specialty coffee culture, but it has taken until now for a truly authentic crop-to-cup coffee shop to sprout in the desert. Calling Peixoto a ""coffee shop"" does not do it justice. Peixoto is a roaster\/retailer of truly world-class specialty coffee. 

Brewed Coffee: full-bodied and more in line with the style of coffee in New York and Chicago. A+

Espresso: Big, rich body surrounded by notes of red fruit and spice. They use La Marzocco and they know how to use it. A+

Slow bar\/manual coffee: Chemex, Hario and Kalita brewers. As I said about their drip\/filter coffee, no one comes close to the body Peixoto is able to achieve. They do not subscribe with tea-like body with zero sustain. A+

Usually décor is not something I even comment on because it is all about the coffee, but holy cow. Peixoto is an absolute design gem. Wood paneling and concrete countertops throughout, Peixoto is like a modern log cabin. 

Staff: No judgment, not pretensions. This is customer service oriented toward adults. 

Overall: This is the only third-wave operation in Arizona that has outgrown the early 2000's coffee Taliban mentality. They have a good product and they want to try it. They are friendly and knowledgeable. One of the most unique outfits in Arizona and maybe all of the West.",1.0
"I've been a member here for more than 2 years (i joined when it was a Gold's Gym). For the most part, I quite like this place - lots of ""regulars,"" quality equipment, and friendly staff. My one complaint is that the current manager is one of the coldest people I've ever met. When I questioned a new policy (requiring me to permit inspection of my gym bag - to confirm that I brought a hand towel), she was rude, condescending and unapologetic. She refused my requests to discuss the issue with the area manager. When I was finally able to catch the area manager at this club, he apologized for Abigail's conduct and indicated that she was not correct. Since then, she has done nothing but glare at me every time I come in - not so much as an apology for her rude treatment. Unfortunately, her conduct detracts from an otherwise quality gym.",1.0
"Nice uptown Izakaya. This may be my new Izakaya go-to uptown, although I'm not sure if they can replace my don don. 

My only complaint is that it was a bit dark in there even during day time and they kept playing with the lights. The music was a bit loud I couldn't even hear the person across from me. The food was decent, my Izakaya favs\/standard bars are salmon warayaki and takoyaki. The salmon warayaki was flavourful, full of smoky aromas, on the pricey side. Combined with a pinch of sea salt it was good texture and taste overall. The takoyakis were nice and small, I like it better than bigger ones that just have more air inside. The piece of octopus inside was then proportionally bigger. There was lots of fish shavings on top and decent amount of mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. Each bite had a good proportion of octopus, warm potato mash and sauce. Since there was only two of us we only tried two other things. Cheese Buldak: hot BBQ chicken with cheese, basically pieces of grilled chicken with hot Korean sauce topped with melted cheese. This dish was okay for me, I don't do so spicy. It wasn't too flavourful and the cheese didn't complement for some reason, I've had better. Also had the Tonkatsu Tamago Toji, fried pork chop with egg in broth. This was interesting to soak the Tonkatsu in broth and went well w the egg. Seems like a pork chop rice without the rice. 

The service was okay, I really like the interior decor, was a good bar atmosphere. It was spacious and can accommodate larger groups. Will definitely come back to try more dishes!",1.0
"Very disappointed in this Phoenix restaurant.  I am visiting and my friend suggested we eat there.  While the menu is nicely priced, sandwiches make up half of the first page.  In small print it states they are not available after 3 or 4.  Why take up over a fourth of the menu with something that's not available for dinner?  We were there at 6:30, so no sandwich for me.

The ""specials"" which are actually the dinner entrees are listed on a small blackboard on the wall with no prices. I asked about the salmon, and our waiter said ""$23"".  OK...that's more than I want to spend, but there really is NOTHING else that looks appealing to me.  (About 1\/2 of the menu is pasta, and I don't eat pasta.). So I order the salmon--sauce on the side.

The salmon comes--HUGE piece--enough for three meals probably.  It is swimming in the sauce.  I asked the waiter for another plate and said ""I meant 'on the side' for the sauce....not on the plate with salmon on top of it.""  So he brings me another plate.  I eat part of the salmon (which was cooked perfectly, I will add).  Then the bill comes--salmon is $24.95.  I said to waiter Travis ""you told me $23"".  His response was ""I was wrong....I'll fix it on your bill.""  I said ""forget it.""   When he brought the change, waiter Travis said ""next time I'll get it right.""  I said ""there won't be a next time...I don't live here....and I won't be back.""

The dog park here is amazing!!! We brought our pup here after very bad encounters at Scotland Dog Park.

This was the perfect place for him and it even had separate places for different sized dogs. All of the people here were extremely friendly and accepted parker and his hyper puppyness. All of the dogs were nice and there were probably 20 or so of them there. There was still plenty of room because it is a huge fenced in area. There is a fountain for the dogs however I suggest bringing your own dog bowl and a lawn chair to sit because there is only one tiny bench. This is a great dog park!!,1.0

"Where to Start,  OK,  I've stayed here 4 times(Mon-Fri) over a 5 week period.  I really want to like this hotel.  It is walking distance to restaurants and bars in Downtown Chandler.  The history of the hotel is interesting, There is a golf course nearly on site.  That's where the positives stop.

Some of these complaints aren't deal breakers by themselves but taken with all the multiple issues per stay, this hotel is simply not worth the money nor very comfortable.  There are several hotels nearby for less money and much nicer.  The only thing going for this place is location and the fact they can do events.  Although I would never subject ""any"" participant to an event I sponsored in this rundown hotel.  It is tired looking, unkept and not up to the standards of a decent hotel, much less a supposed Luxury hotel.   They must pay for the positive reviews.  


Issues you will encounter every week:


*) Furnishing old and worn,  Lamps kind of match in rooms but not between rooms,  The furniture looks like it came from a yard sale for old hotels.  Beat up, scratched, wobbly, etc.

*) Rooms dark, dingy looking and have a old mildew smell to them.  one had a sewer smell.  
*) Very few amenities,  soap dishes, note pads, etc,  Has the feel of an ""airport comfort inn"". 
   You get 1 shampoo and they usually don't replace it daily, it is Crown Plaza brand.   Also, as Spire Elite I get the Aroma therapy kit,  Usually get 1 every night at other Crown Plazas,  Only 1 on arrival at this hotel. no hand soap or no shower soap. You get one small bar per stay of either but not both. 
*) No comforter on bed.  Just sheets with a slim cover at the foot(Like a duvet)  
*) Really bad coffee,  Generic square packs like you can get at the Dollar Tree,  coffee maker takes pods which are round, the best you can do is warm coffee colored water in the mornings. decaf is often different brand than regular both are horrible. 
*) Outside hallways with no path to lobby. (Nothing can be done about this as the hotel is designed around an old resort) But, its one more negative.  Elevator at rear of building makes navigation around property awkward. 

Week 1) Hot water spotty if there was any,  Elevator broken,  Tried to charge $10 for Refrigerator. Shower old and stained, Tile in bathroom shower was cheap floor tile from home depot, very amateurish installation, gaps and crooked.  This was a recurring theme.  Apparently replacing marble with cheap ceramic tile qualifies as ""renovation"", tubs looked to be 20 years old with no work done to them.  

Week 2) -Water would not turn off in bathroom,  
    - no alarm clock in room.  complained several times during week, faucet broken (running continuously, not dripping, running at a stream).  Finally fixed water facet after 2 complete days,  never received an alarm the whole week.  It was comical.  Front desk would smile and say ""We'll make sure today that you get an alarm, we don't understand why you don't have one."" But none was delivered.  Had to use my Iphone for alarm on travel day (Friday) 

Week 3)  No TV! for 3 days, seriously???  Went to desk every day to get update of ""He doesn't know what is wrong with it"" TV out Monday evening until Thurday evening. 
Shower stained which was the case for every room I had, Furnishings beat up and old,  

Week 4) Why you ask?  I had booked in advance and forgot to cancel it.  Just figured I would tough it out.  And it was tough,  Sink in bathroom stopped up,  Toilet seat broken,  only 3 hangers in closet, no valet for suitcase.  Didn't even complain just put up with it, as I knew it was my last time at the property.

"Writing this review only because I care about Buca and this last visit (Yesterday 03.29.2015) was awful. 

The Good:

1- I made a reservation on open table and we got in 15 minutes early yet we got seated right away.
2- Were greeted by a hostess and she was very welcoming
3- The food as always is good
4- Our server Paulo was good as he was doing EVERYTHING, literally, everything and see the BAD section for more details.

The Bad:

1- Service was VERY SLOW, and that is not because Paulo, it is because Paulo was doing EVERYTHING. From clearing tables, then cleaning them, getting the food out, checking on everyone to make sure they have everything. 
2- Service was very slow
3- Service was very slow 

The management at this restaurant seems that they did not care yesterday. As there were no buss staff, clearing  tables or food runners to get t he food out. They did not care to at least pick up the pace and come over an ask at least how things were, knowing that the section the server was serving at is short staffed. I felt so bad for the server, that i really wanted to get up and do something. 

A party of 5 or 6 showed up after us an the hostess brought them to the same section we were seated, and Paulo the server was making sure we were taken care of but at the same time he asked that group to wait for a few minutes while he cleaned the table they were being seated at. The Hostess did not even bother to help clear the table. Overall it was bad and we have been to too many different Buca locations and this is the first time i see such a mess.

"We walked from Fremont Street experience to this place on a windy, cool Friday afternoon! The one and only employee we saw was very friendly and helpful. We shared an order of the teen spirit fries, they were really tasty and came with a chipolte aioli sauce which was excellent! We also shared a full order of the Buffalo Soldier pasta dish. It is creamy blue cheese macaroni topped with boneless buffalo chicken garnished with carrots and celery. It was a large portion and very creamy, definitely plenty for two and included garlic toast! Overall we were very pleased with the meal! We felt the value and quality was outstanding! The place is extremely small and we came at a quiet time!

"The second time around at this hotel I'm going to give them an upgraded rating.

The parking issues weren't the same as last time as I was able to park at the front and while it was raining the day I was there there weren't any floods going on like last time.

The hotel is well kept and the rooms are nice as I remember from last time.  The staff here from the front desk to the restaurant as very friendly and accommodating.

I especially like the restaurant on the lower level as both for breakfast and dinner I've been treated well each time.

The room with a king bed is spacious and seems larger than a typical ~500 sq\/ft room.  Either way the furnishings are good, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom has a vent which many these days don't seem to have I've noticed.

"Wish I could leave zero stars after the horrible experience I had with Sauce last night. 

At 7 pm I placed a delivery order; Sauce stated a 90 minute wait time maximum. 2 hours later my boyfriend and I were still waiting for food and getting irritable. We started calling them numerous times. Their phones appeared to be off the hook or out of service and calls wouldn't go through. Boyfriend got on Facebook and sent them a message regarding this issue. 20 minutes later Sauce responded and claimed that ""It was the busiest night ever...our phones shorted out. Did you get your food yet?"" To which we said no. 

After total wait time of 2 hrs 40 minutes, which is absolutely unacceptable, the food finally arrived. The delivery guy said that the meal would still be charged in full. Refused the meal because at this point it would obviously be cold and we were forced to order food from a different place after the extensive wait. Boyfriend got on Facebook and sent Sauce a polite message explaining what had happened. Instead of apologizing or offering any type of reparation, Sauce responded that the situation was our fault because when the delivery guy showed up extremely late, he had an issue at our guard gate and was waiting to get in. Sauce claimed that he was waiting for 40 mins. Blatant lie, as I checked the call logs on my cell phone. We did miss a call from the guard gate but the delay on our end wasn't more than 10 minutes. 

I'm extremely disappointed with this experience, because we have tried Sauce delivery before with no issues and the food was pretty tasty. However, I will absolutely never order from them again. The delivery fee and food prices are already expensive; at that point you expect quality service. Ridiculous wait time with absolutely no apology on their end or offer to remedy the issues. Then lying about the situation and blaming us! Insane. Whoever is running the business obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction- or keeping customers at all. And whoever is operating through their Facebook account should be given a lesson in how to manage problems like the one last night. Their response to what happened was completely out of line. Never again.",1.0

 I really enjoyed that it is standard policy for baby to stay w\/mom in her room at All times, instead of being taken to a nursery. I had a chance to see the NICU as well and it was very nice; warm, calm environment for the babies. All the nurses that I encountered were very sweet and attentive. They were always more than willing to help me out with baby even for very simple things. They were very very generous with samples to take home, such as pads, diapers, formula\/breastpump items, etc etc. The recovery ward even had an open-access pantry room that had a microwave for use and a refrigerator with items such as drinks, sandwiches, popsicles, etc available to patients at any time. The breakfast, lunch, dinner meal options were ok but hey it's hospital food right it's not going to be five stars lol

Had some damage to my rear bumper so my son recommended Capitol Collision. Checked them out online and at BBB they are A+. Like many others I had a really good experience with them. They answered all my questions, guided me through the process, kept in communication and did a ""like new"" professional repair along with a warranty. My car was ready long before promised.  It had been washed and  the front carpeting cleaned (which I really appreciated).  Looked great!  Nice dealing with courteous, knowledgeable,  professional people who give you that something extra.

"This location is nice and close to my house and has an excellent selection of snacky-snacks. Which is always a good thing.
A great tip is that if you use your Fry's VIP card frequently then you can earn points towards money off gas. You could save up to a dollar per gallon of gas which is great. The program works very simply and for every hundred points that you earn on your Fry's VIP card you would get $.10 off per gallon so for this particular trip I got to save $.20 per gallon which adds up to quite a savings and I love that program since Fry's is right too!
I am deducting a star for the flow pumps that they have. I feel like it takes so long to fill your tank unlike any other gas station in the valley. After reading some of the other kids and reviews I noticed that I'm not the only one that has this problem.

"Definitely a hidden gem! Thanks to a friend I was able to find this little Cafe in the back. It's pretty much impossible to see IS SWEET when driving down the street so I'm glad to see them doing well.

Also the lady came out in the cold to deliver what we ordered. Thank you! =) 

On to the dessert, it was very sweet (of course), I expected the green tea crepe cake to be warm, as if it was straight off the griddle. It was cold or rather cool but still very delicious. The texture was soft and ""melting-like,"" very satisfying. Also ordered was honey toast. Everywhere else I've ordered this came with vanilla ice cream, as they didn't add any. We were 100% okay with this since the weather circumstances. Boy was the honey toast great! Warm, super soft on the inside, with semi crunchy crust makes great honey toast.

So while my girlfriend picked out what she wanted I noticed they had cupcakes which is one of my guilty pleasures lol so I decide to pick up a red velvet and a turtle cupcake. So I've been home for a day and just had my turtle cupcake from Campbell's and I must say it met every last standard I have when it comes to cupcakes.

"MJ Live has now left the Rio and has begun a residency at the Stratosphere.  We picked up our discount tickets that i bought on line a few days earlier.  I decided to go this route after finding the discount ticket broker after a web search because we were seeing MJ Live on a holiday evening.  Not to worry, there were a lot of empty seats fo this performance.  

The Stratosphere Theater is a decently sized and nice theater.  It's much larger than the tribute shows at the V Theater at the Miracle Mile.  We sat about 3\/4 of the way back and the seats were OK.  If the show is crowded, you will probably have to share a table or booth with others.  Would have been nice to have been closer, but if you get too close, you'll realize that the performer really doesn't look like Michael Jackson.  But from our seats, he looked, sounded, danced, and sang like the real thing.  Great moonwalk.  

We saw Jalles Franca perform as Michael Jackson.  I guess there are three performers who play Michael Jackson.  I though Franca did a great job in all aspects, including hitting those high notes.  

Show moves quickly and is very entertaining.  Not sure if the dancers on stage were really necessary.  They did come in handy for the Jackson 5 portion of the show.  

The only negative I noticed was that the four piece band seemed to rely on taped horn parts if the keyboardist wasn't using a horn synthesizer, and the use of taped background vocals since I noticed that none of the musicians or dancers were singing.  Use of pre-recorded vocals might lead one to the conclusion that the lead vocals were taped as well, but I didn't think so in this case.  

I recommend this show.",1.0
"Visited this restaurant a couple of times for business meetings during the day. It's quite reasonably priced for Oliver and Bonacini food on the top floor of a building--certainly less than Canoe.

The challenge with this establishment is the club-like ambiance and accompanying service. Waiters forget things, don't notice you, and somehow manage to find a balance between trying too hard and missing details.

For example, during both my visits, the waiters mixed up sparkling and flat water, resulting in a semi-carbonated beverage for everyone at the table. They remedied this by re-pouring flat water, but the member of our party who had the carbonated drink in the first place was just left with the partially carbonated glass. By the end of our meal, there were 9 water glasses at the table for a party of four (no one ordered any beverage other than water).

Yes tattoos hurt, but I also get all anxious. I did everything proper before my appt; I had a pancake breakfast, a good nights sleep and lots of water. About 10 minutes into my tattoo, a simple black symbol, I started getting a little hot. I asked the artist if I could just have a little break and have some water. I had my water bottle with me and started sipping and they just let me relax. One of the other guys even went and got me a coke and protein bar. After my little dizzy spell I was feeling back to normal and we continued. No issues after that at all! I was assured that these spells can happen to anyone and usually after it passes they are fine. I feel really good about my experience and can't wait to get my next tattoo done! I'm so happy that the artist was reassuring with me and encouraging me. It was such a great time!

I also love the green tea ice cream you get at the end. The red Dragon roll again is probably the best one I've had anywhere. It's huge and delicious. The only dishes I didn't really like here were the udon and their Boston roll. The side dishes and rolls used to be inconsistent when the part time sushi chef because they would be smaller and fall apart but the owner really gets it right.

"When we're in town, the wife and I like to get away from the Strip and experience some of the places frequented and loved by Las Vegas locals.  After doing a little research, we decided to grab dinner at Chada Thai & Wine on a Wednesday night.  We arrived a few minutes before our 7:30 reservations and were seated promptly.  I was surprised at the restaurant's very small dining room, a marked contrast to the widely-renowned and much larger Lotus of Siam.  That said, good things come in small packages and Chada Thai packed a lot of goodness in its space that equaled and, in some respects surpassed, Lotus of Siam.

We ordered the Pad Hed ($8), stir-fried Shitake and Shimeji mushrooms with Brussels sprouts and lotus root; the Duck Panang ($18), roasted duck with panang sauce and kaffir lime leaf; and lastly, the Sen Mee Kang Pou ($12), crab curry served with thin rice noodles.  We accompanied our meal with a bottle of the 2007 Ridge Monte Bello.  I love mushrooms and the Pad Hed was a delicious dish.  The Duck Panang was even better with its perfectly crispy skin and moist, tender flesh.  My favorite, though, was the Sen Mee Kang Pou.  I love Thai curry and I love spicy Thai food.  I could tell it was appropriately spicy as it made my forehead sweat just a little, but didn't overpower my palate with a spicy burn.  I've found the food in many Thai restaurants I've been to be way too salty.  Chad Thai hit the right mark with its seasoning.  All of our food items were reasonably priced and great values.  Similarly, the wine list, while certainly not the largest or most diverse in town, contained a solid selection of wines at varying price points.  Our bottle of wine was not inexpensive, but knowing what it cost retail, Chada Thai's markup was surprisingly reasonable.  Service throughout our meal was attentive.  Our only negative from our experience (and it was not the fault of the restaurant) was that being visitors to the city, we took a cab to the restaurant.  After calling several cab companies, it was impossible to get a cab to come pick us up , with all of them stating it would take 30 min. or longer (on a Wednesday night, no less).  Boy, it would've been nice to be able to use Uber.  Thanks, Las Vegas cab mafia!  We walked halfway back to the Strip up Spring Mountain before being able to flag down a cab to take us back to our hotel.

Chada Thai & Wine is definitely a local gem.  The food and wine was top notch.  I'd gladly go again the next time we're in town; however, we may have to rent a car on our next visit.",1.0
"We were very disappointed that after arranging a pick up in advance that the Scottsdale Cab Guy did not show up until 15 minutes after we called them half an hour after the scheduled pickup time. 

I would like to reiterate that not only did we schedule a week in advance, but we also confirmed the reservation the day before and were assured that all was in order and the driver would be at the pickup point at 12:00 noon. 

Our company was holding a training workshop and we had arranged a Pizza party for the last day. Since the great local pizza joint we wanted to use didn't deliver we had arranged for Scottsdale Cab Guy to pick up and deliver the Pizza for us. Due to the cab company forgetting to show, once they finally did pick it up our Pizza was lukewarm at best. Timing was important to us, but apparently being on time, or even showing up at all, is not important to Scottsdale Cab Guy.",1.0
"Our favorite go to restaurant while at a conference at the MGM grand. Make online reservations for lunch and dinner to save yourself waiting an hour to get in.

"It is so sad when a medical staff refuse to service a emergency patient. I was a emergency patient who has not been able to keep any food or water down and was refused to be medically treated by the doctor because of a fee which a staff employee Alicia said "" this is a fee that we can charge you no matter what the amount because your surgery was not done by us, but if you were a patient who did their surgery by us, then we would accom. you""... This is so sad that they turned away a patient for a additional cash fee which could have been waived since i was using insurance.. I hope the doctor does see this comment and i will make sure they are aware of this. It is not ok to turn away a lap and patient who has informed a staff that she has not drank water for 3 days in this 117 degree heat... Shame on this staff who did nothing to help accommodate me...

My family was very specific on the types and colors they wanted, while on the phone we worked through the details and literally within minutes the arrangements were handled. Come Monday, when I arrived to the cemetery the flowers were delivered on time and precisely the way we ordered them.

"I came here to do Hot Pilates with a good friend of mine. It was our first time, and fortunately, the staff was very patient with us and they made small talk with us while we registered to get into class. Apparently, if you sign up for a week at TruFusion, you can do as many classes as you want for $7.00. Not a bad price. 

On top of that, TruFusion was a simple and super clean studio that featured a cafe, jewelry and workout clothes, in which you can experience yourself pre or post workout.

The workout itself was absolutely phenomenal. The Hot Pilates instructor (I forgot her name) was great and challenged the whole class to keep going in the 80 degree 40% humid studio. There were tons of people that enrolled in the class, so make sure to get there early to reserve a spot on the ground, otherwise, you'll be stuck in front of the door like I was (even though it wasn't half bad).

"Been here 3-4 times and they never disappoint. food is made fresh how you order it everytime and have never had a bad experience with the food here. There are 2 things that keep it from getting a perfect 5 stars. First, I personally prefer soft shell tacos to hard shells, and you can only get hard shells here. They taste fine, but I would like the option. Secondly, this place needs its own way to place an order online. My office would probably eat here everyday as it is so close, but few people in a call center can take time off to place an order. Even accepting orders through Facebook, even Email or something would be sufficient for a small place like this! Until then, once or twice a month is the max my co-workers and I can handle.

I ordered the spicy tuna roll and the 6oz hibachi entree  as a combo with the addition of salad, soup and fried rice.  The best part of the meal was the soup and the yum yum sauce....yes you read that right. 

In a nutshell: the chicken was lacking flavor, hard, and dry, the salad was drowned in the ginger dressing, the veggies were overcooked and the sushi was just a mushy mess.

"Ju Izakaya is my favourite of all the restaurants located with J-Town. While the selection of food for an Izakaya is a bit smaller, the food itself makes up for it. The set up of the restaurant is also split into two sections, alcohol and no alcohol.

We regularly order the Takoyaki which is usually pretty good. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with a piece of octopus inside. 

My favourite dish is their Osaka Cha-Han which is an octopus fried rice. It's covered in the same sauce that the Takoyaki is made of which is sweet and tangy and is absolutely delicious.

Another highlight is the Negitoro-don which is a rice dish with diced pieces of raw tuna that you pour soy sauce and wasabi over. The tuna is fresh and the wasabi provided is real wasabi and not just paste.

"Does Stockyards engage in racial profiling? 

Yes. 

The service is absolutely terrible. My friend and I are both black and we wanted to try out this place because of the reviews. My friend went in first while I parked the car. When I entered, the waitress said ""who's here for a table of two"". In response, we said ""us"", and she looked straight through us and had a full on conversation with the white customers next to us. After she finished her conversation, she said ""come here"". 

After she sat us down, we waited for almost 15 minutes and she didn't even come to ask for our orders. When she passed by us, I had to flag her down and tell her that we were finally ready to order. No apology for the long wait. Nothing. When she finally got our food after another 25 minutes, we noticed that she was much more attentive with the white guests in the restaurant than with us. When I asked for extra napkins, she made a huge ""sigh"" and hit my shoulder with the napkins. She was sarcastic, unprofessional and annoying. By contrast, she was so respectful and patient with the white guests. We couldn't believe it. 

The good thing is that they forgot to charge us for the orange juice and considering the shitty service we didn't remind them. 

The funny thing is that I usually tip above and beyond 15% when I receive normal to good service. Just do your job and I won't have a problem. But the service was awful and intentionally disrespectful. 

So, if you're white and want to have your white privilege re-affirmed, then you should goto Stockyards. Otherwise, non-white people and white people with a conscious should watch out for this place. If you want a 1940's, Mason-Dixon line, Plantation experience, then come to Stockyards!

I love getting the asian zing and mango habanero sauce for the wings as well as desert heat seasoning for the fries.

However, I went on a non-Tuesday and the service was just horrrribblleee. How was I getting better service on Tuesdays??

Since I've made wings before, I can understand why it takes so long for it to come out. I noticed that they wait for your entire party's orders to be ready before they bring anything out.

"It's... not bad here. Honestly the food is pretty good, not the best Mexican food but certainly not the worst. Their chimichanga dish in particular is great, but they stopped serving it with beans for whatever reason. Any other Mexican restaurant you go to will serve it with rice and beans, but that's just a small complaint. Really what they lost stars on is service. It's certainly quick, but almost too much so... to the point where it actually feels like they're pushing you out the door. I had met with a college friend for dinner here once, intending to catch up, we had finished our meals, paid the tab, left a generous tip (which the server picked up while we were still seated, which having been a waitress myself seems a bit of a faux pas unless your shift is ending or the restaurant is about to close for the night) but we were still finishing our alcoholic beverages. He then came back to the table, asked if we wanted anything else, then after we said we were fine, said ""Okay, because other people are waiting to be seated."" We hadn't even been there an hour. Having been a waitress, I understand most of your income will come from tips, but we ripped generously and regardless, you don't speak to a table like that. If I wanted to eat and leave in 10 minutes I would have gone out for fast food. On a separate occasion I paid in cash, expecting change, and watched as my server walked out the door for the end of his shift, never to return... basically taking a 50% tip. To be fair, I have complained to the company about their service and they do get back to you\/ sometimes offer a gift card or something but if they send me one anymore I just give them away. I have no intention to return here when there are other Mexican restaurants with better food and friendlier service.",1.0

The waiter was a super nice guy who ensured we were not lacking anything. The atmosphere is very mellow and they play some great music.

The ""$8.99 lunch specials"" sign outside is pretty misleading, considering a soup and salad combo is $8.99 and the rest of the lunch entrees are about $12 and up. Our server told us we could order from the lunch menu or family style menu, which would probably save us a couple bucks if two or more of us wanted the same thing. You can definitely share even the lunch portions. We had the chicken parmigiana with spaghetti, the baked ziti and the spicy chicken rigatoni. All three were HUGE portions and I ate maybe 1\/3 of mine. Our server was just kind of rude and insisted she couldn't split the appetizer between our checks (I waited tables for about five years and I find it hard to believe your computer system doesn't have that capability), but food was decent and not bad for the price compared to other Vegas restaurants.",1.0

With that aside, the first time I visited here I was looking for a microSD card. Unfortunately the cards are over the counter, so I had to ask an employee to get it for me.

There's also no notification that you would get service if you ask an employee by any of the cashier booths...like, come on.

The second time I had a completely different experience. I was treated by a female employee who quickly asked me if I needed assistance, and I said yes as I was looking for an external hard drive. She took 3-4 minutes to explain the different hard drives, sizes, brands, etc...until I finally interrupted her and told her I only wanted a specific size with a certain price range. She quickly went in the warehouse and found one that fits my budget perfectly.

"Had my hubby pick up food on his way home from work based on the reviews. We both got the baked ziti, unfortunately it was pretty dry. Neither of us cared for it.

Since it's my birthday we also ordered tiramisu (we have a sick kid, so we are stuck at home)...it was decent. I have to say I was so excited to try Nick's out...it was expensive for the quality of food. Maybe the food is better in the restaurant but we won't be coming in. 

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant based on our experience.",1.0
"I need to update to say that I am moving and my heart is really sad. I still love everything about Forage and always take out of town guests here. Last weekend k.

"Check in area is a mess. No defined lines or queue, you end up lining up to whichever front desk person you'd like. There's also no special line for M Life Gold, platinum or nior members! You can imagine my frustration when the line that we pick is going much slower than others so we end up waiting longer than some people who have just walked up! We also didn't get any room upgrades with our m life status, which was ok since I didn't mind a standard room facing the parking area. But what's the point of this status system anyway?

Next the room we got was HOT. The temperature of the room when we got in was 78 degrees. Ugh! We immediately went to turn it down. However later realized the AC system was broken and the temp was not lowering. The maintenance guy was very nice and helped us solve the issue. However this just wasn't a good start to the bellagio experience. I was hoping for much more. Also note that the rooms facing the parking area face the sun when the sun is setting which can quickly heat up your room!

The room is nice and clean. Large bathroom with tub and separate shower. It's unfortunate they haven't updated their nightstand area to include outlets or USB charging hubs. (UPDATE: There is one outlet at the bottom of the lamps next to the bed!) Nothing very special about the rooms but at least the bed is comfortable and people aren't too noisy in the hallways. I think there are plenty of other hotel options that can provide the same if not better quality and experience for the price. 

Definitely agree with some of the other reviews. You don't need to stay here,but definitely visit and check out the restaurants like Michael mind and the garden area which is always updated for each holiday and season.

Last note - for ATT phones\/customers, I had terrible reception throughout the hotel and especially in the hotel room. Luckily there's free wifi for hotel guests.",1.0
"We visited Las Vegas and decided to do a tour of the Grand Canyon South Rim. At first I found this company through a deal on Groupon. When I visited their website, they had an even better offer and I booked the tour for around $75\/person. 
Pick up was at 6.10 am at our hotel and the driver picked us up on the dot. After all the pick ups, the bus stopped at their office for coffee and danish(included in the package). We were then designated a bus with a tour guide\/driver Frosty. 
Frosty did an amazing job. We drove through Lake Mead and Hoover Dam before breaking for lunch. Yes, lunch was included in the package as well and was a surprisingly excellent buffet with a pretty elaborate menu. 
We then visited the Mather Point for a good hour and then the Bright Angel Point for about two hours. We got a good three hours in the Grand Canyon National Park area on the whole. 
We then headed back. There were a couple of restroom breaks in the tour that made the journey very convenient. The bus had a restroom too.
Frosty played some really hilarious movies during the tour. I was really happy about the overall quality of the tour.
Definitely recommend this tour to anyone that wants to visit Grand Canyon from Las Vegas.",1.0

"I moved into Camden Hayden just after it opened in Late December with my boyfriend on a 9 month lease, which is the lowest they offer, and perfect for us. They also have the standard 12 and 15 month. 

We toured the place after looking at a few other luxury places around town before being wowed by everything at Camden. The styling and finishes are beautiful, Location is superd, but we like the layouts are rely what sold us. we live in a 1 bedroom that is very spacious and open concept. We toured the other 1 and 2 bedrooms layouts and you get just as much living space in the 1 bedroom as you do with 2 bedrooms which is nice.

Pros: 
Floor Plans
Large open floor plans with gorgeous kitchens. Everyone who sees my kitchen loves it an doesn't even believe I'm not living in a condo when they see pictures. Like I said there are a lot of different floor plans to choose from they all flow really well.
 
Light and windows
Lots of natural light and attention to window placement. The place is also has an abundance of lighting, track lighting in the dining and kitchen which also has pendant lights, celling plans in bedroom and living room, both with lights!
So far the noise level from other residents hasn't been an issue at all. If someone talks in the hallway though it can be heard inside the apartment as if they are yelling. People here generally keep to themselves and get out of the hallway quickly, but should be noted.

Amenities
 are 24 hours, fitness center, indoor outdoor lounge, pool. They also have a fireplace,pool table, mac and PC in the lounge for printing. They stock the lounge with trail mix cereal and milk in the refrigerator so thats a bonus. I love that I can go at anytime of day if I want to. So far they are pretty empty but time will tell when the place fills up how busy they get.

Who lives here
Mix of young and older. I wouldn't say its a college kid complex, but it has a younger vibe. even though I'm a student I don't want to live in party central if you know what Im mean. 

Location
Can walk pretty much anywhere you'd want to go if need be. Marquee is down the street. The lake and Mill aren't far past that for those drunken nights when you need to walk home. Camden isn't too far from anything so you won't have a problem getting anywhere.

Maintenance and staff
The Staff has been great from day 1. They know this place is awesome so they don't have to hard sell and are very genuine great people to talk to. Miranda is my favorite so talk to her if you come. The whole leasing experience was amazing!
We had a small leak under the bathroom sink and a few screws missing on the shelves on our closet so we put in a maintenance request online. We opted for them to come even if we were out and they did. By the time we got home from the grocery store the leak had been fixed and the screws were in place. They left us a confirmation the the kitchen counter. I was pleasantly surprised how quick they responded. Ive heard so many bad things about maintenance at other complexes so I didn't have high hopes, but they exceeded my expectations.


Cons: 
Fire Department
 on the South side of the building. We stupidly didm;t notice when we toured the place, but love it too much to care. I live on the South side facing outward, and the fire trucks are noticeable, but they aren't as annoying as I thought they would be. Might not be a problem at all if you live in the building farther north.

Continuous planes
 flying by throughout the day. You are pretty much living directly over the flight path which can get annoying if you're home during the day.

The surrounding location hasn't ""come up really."" Theres a strip club I can see with my window that is drenched in lights and flashing shit which is kind of eh. Lots of car dealerships that look abandoned on Scottsdale Rd. This isn't really a con, just something to say in case someone cares.



All in all I really enjoy living here and will be sad when I move out. I feel like any place I move will be a downgrade from this place! There are so many more good things to say about this place but I don't want to bore you. Tour it and you'll move in same day!",1.0

"This is an awesome place!

We came here for pre-race carb-loading two years in a roll before Ironman Arizona. They are very accommodating for the big groups. They also let you know the deep dish pizza will take long ahead of time so we can adjust what we want accordingly.

"Sanremo is the place cheat day dreams are made of! They take a lot of pride in what they do here and they do it well. It is impressive to see what a large volume and variety of items they make fresh here. 

Always packed on the weekends, but since it is sectioned off into lines for deli, coffee, sandwiches\/hot food, and bakery, you never wait too long. I love the sandwiches and pizza, each one I've tried is better than the last and I've tried a lot. The roast beef, Italian cold cut, and turkey sandwiches have fried onion on them, so good. They make great veggie pizzas, too. Recently had the eggplant and tomato pizza which was fantastic. 

The bakery is to die for. They have racks full of fresh baked breads, pies, and tarts that are works of art. The bakery case houses donuts and other sweet treats. The apple fritter donut is popular and for good reason, extra crispy outside and pillowy warm inside. 

For an authentic Italian bakery and deli, you won't find a better option than Sanremo. Just don't expect to eat light of you come here!",1.0

Went there last night to meet a few friends whom were seated on the patio. I got there an explained to the glorified security guard that I was there to see a few friends and they were seated 6 feet away from where I was standing.

Nice place great atmosphere but annoying to go all the way there and find out there is a limit as to how many people can be seated on the patio when there was room for at least 6 more people there comfortably.,1.0
"I have been here twice and I have had a great experience both times!   If you are craving soup noodles this should be on your list.  I hear this place gets busy during peak hours, but I have been fortunate enough to always find a table right away

Items I have tried:

Shanxi Knife Slices Noodle Soup $8 - I think this is their most popular dish and I understand why.  It is filled with beef brisket, sweet potato vermicelli, black fungus, and pickled cabbage.  This is not spicy at all, but you have to like a salty and pickled vegetable flavor.  The brisket is beautifully cooked and the hand cut noodles are the perfect consistency.  If you could only try one dish, this would be the one.

Lan Zhou Beef Noodle Soup $8 - Just the right amount of Szechuan spice for me.  The flavor of the broth and meat came through wonderfully and if was craving something spicy I would reorder this again

Pork Wontons in spicy chili oil $6 - If you have the extra room in your stomach; this is a great appetizer\/side dish.  You get a quite a few wontons to share easily with a group of three or four people and the meat is super tasty.  The spicy chili oil is a perfect combo with the wontons!

Hot and Spicy Noodle $8 - I thought I could handle spicy food, but apparently I can't hang.  The first few bites of this dish was amazing, but I had to tap out from drinking too much of the broth because it was just too spicy for me.  If you really like spicy, you will like this dish because it is jam packed full of flavor, but it is some serious spice.",1.0
"Never order delivery from this place.

 I live not too far away from them, and after an hour and a half of waiting ( when the wait time is supposed to be 20-30mins), I had to phone and ASK them what was going on. To which they responded; "" Oh.. oh yeah. You did order something"". Not even an apology.

  And the two times I decided to order and pick up, when I got home, they always get it wrong. And I always have to go back. 
 Their food isn't too bad when they get it right. But it's always a gamble. You have a 1 in 5 chance of mistakes, failure to deliver, or incredibly soggy soup-like coconut rice. 
  I've given up on them after my last experience because I sometimes I just want food delivery to go as it's ordered with no problems. And as for takeout, I dont want to have to phone them, tell them the order is wrong, or weird- and have to go back.

 It could be a nice restaurant if it weren't for such stupid things.",1.0
"Unfortunately, I found this to be a rather disappointing meal. I ordered the 6oz ""barrel-cut"" filet rare, specifically cold in the center. It came out on the upper end of rare, closer to medium rare and was extremely oversalted. I had to scrape off the char since it was so salty. I'm sure part of the problem was how thin the filet was, but they should know better.

Maybe my expectations are too high since my usual steakhouse is Mastro's in Los Angeles or my home, which I can do on part with Mastro's, but at $29 for 6oz, this place isn't cheap either.

On the plus side, the pretzel bread sticks were really good, albeit a bit greasy.",1.0
"Amaizing the way the store is set up. I am always impress with all you can find. On the second floor they have full kitchens, bedrooms, bahrooms, living and dinning rooms. It hives the appearance in some areas that you are in a house or an apartment. You can see the different desings and colors. Everything looks really nice. 

Downstairs it's all the stuff you can build, cashers and   a food section, wherr you can try some ice cream and hot dogs. But if you are looking for a good breakfast or lunch, uou can find it upstairs in the restaurant.

I have have flown to Santa Barbara, Tucson, various places in LA and not only did I learn I also had lots of fun.  Borris (81 Beech F33A) is well equipped and very fast. It maneuvers very well and I loved every minute I flew him.  I also mada a few new pilot friends through Meiko which are dear to me.  That kind of personal attention and fun are seldom found at a flight school.  I cant wait to fly with Meiko again and neither should you if you want to be a pilot.",1.0
Horrible. I remember this place was good when I was younger. I'm not sure what happened but it was awful. The sauce taste like ketchup not BBQ. We clearly were not happy with the food and the waiter just sat the check there for us to pay as we didn't eat anything.,1.0
"After many failed attempt to make it to a buffet. We came here on a Monday night after EDC.  I'm glad we did. The line wasn't insanely long but it still took us a little over two hours to get a seating for 3. All I have to say is that it was worth ""the wait"". Hands down, you must get the fresh oysters and pan roast! The oysters were huge! A lot bigger than expected which explains why we ordered two dozens and couldn't even finish. They are very generous with their portions so order wisely. The drinks were good too. My dirty martini was made right and my friend's Bloody Mary had a perfect amount of spice. The oyster shooter was good even though it took more than one gulp to shoot it down due to the size of the oysters. In conclusion, we would come back!",1.0
"Seven Lives is a must stop when browsing Kensington Market. Note, this is a cash only business. Also, come early because the line goes out the door and into the street during peak hours.

We tried the smoked tuna, Baja fish, Mahi Mahi, and grilled octopus tacos. Across the board, the tacos were refreshing with so much flavor. Normally, I'm not a fan of corn tortillas yet these were perfect!

They also have three hot sauces: a mild, a medium Serrano, and a hot. Be careful with the hot; it is very spicy but has lots of flavor.

These tacos are neck and neck with Los Tacos No. 1 in NYC's Chelsea market.",1.0
"Crispy fried chicken skins with a sweet honey glaze. Dates with a mild sausage and basalmic. A perfect fried chicken with homemade Louisiana hot sauce...just enough tangy to go with a mild heat. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy. Pot pie is very rich. Bone marrow with a oxtail jam and a perfectly made sweet biscuit. All of the breads were amazing. Surprised they make several variation of their biscuits in-house that come with different plates. Drink menu is as good as it gets. A wide range of juleps, a full list of classic cocktails, and a list of newer drinks. 

It's small, but the ambiance is great. Very cool lighting with open viewing of the kitchen, which is neat because there are several wood fired grills cooking the food.",1.0
"I was craving a Philly Cheese Steak today and so after considering the reviews of a number of restaurants offering them. I decided that Corleone's was the best bet for a real Philadelphia style cheese steak near my zip code. 

Because it is a chain, I arrived slightly skeptical, and ready to have a less than wonderful experience, in spite of the positive ratings. Thank goodness the positive reviews were accurate!

I arrived barely ahead of the lunch crowd. At least 15 people crowded in right behind me, which I took for a good sign. I ordered the small rib eye steak sandwich ""wit"" (with) grilled onions, grilled peppers & mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese. I skipped the cheese wiz because my memory of Philly cheese steaks in Philly and NY as I was growing up had NO association what-so-ever with cheese wiz. The young man who took my order was very helpful with my order, and my eventual cheese choice of mozzarella over provolone.  (Mozzarella melts better he said, and he was right!)

My sandwich was completely cooked to order. There was no partially cooked steak sitting to the side of a grill waiting to be warmed and served - this was cooked fresh! The onions, mushrooms and green peppers were also perfectly grilled, and combined with the meat and mozzarella cheese were perfect! The bun initially had a bit of crunch, so I think that the inside was grilled or toasted.

All in all, it was a delicious sandwich. The meat was nicely cooked and the sandwich was nice and juicy and perfectly seasoned. I added a combination of the hot cherry peppers and a few sweet cherry peppers from the condiment bar to my sandwich to make each bite just right. The cheese was perfectly hot and melted, creating delicious strands of cheese from the sandwich to my mouth. Once I started eating, I could not put the sandwich down. It was REALLY good. FAR better than I would have expected from a Philly Cheese Steak in Arizona...

I didn't try any of the sides, but the pizza did look really good. I think it will be a while however, before I have anything but the cheese steak - just like I had it today!

For a small cheese steak and a small drink, my tab was nine dollars and change, but it was worth every penny!",1.0
"Great concept here at downtown Summerlin in the midst of several generic restaurants with the same old same old. 
       The public school theme is fun and the memorabilia on the walls and around the venue gives you a fun look into Las Vegas's local past. The menu looked like a marble notebook and the cocktail napkin looked like a note passed from a classmate.               
        Our server, Jared Smith gave us a great rundown of the menu and explained the beer selection really well. We were able to sample quite a few before making our selections and by the time we left the restaurant we had ordered almost all oft them. 
         I would definitely recommend the shrimp and grits and the cauliflower, delicious. Fun place, craft beer, good food, reasonable prices, and fantastic service. I'll be back. :))",1.0
"Although there was nothing wrong with their service (ie - we never had any more or less bugs) I could not get them to call before they came.  I repeatedly called the office and asked them if they could come on a specific day of the month, each month at approximately the same time.  I have a compound like backyard, with small dogs, and I like my privacy.  To find someone in my backyard spraying without knowing he's out there, freaks me out.  I finally fired them after talking to both the technician and the owner or operator at least four times about this issue.  Hopefully the new company will stick to this simple request because Bills could not.  Strangely, both the gardener and the pool guy get this...do you think Bills just has so much business they can afford to lose a customer?  I guess so.",1.0
"My work has used this company in the past but recently, we had rented from them for a large event and the rep who I spoke with first was fine, BUT the other one who I spoke with a couple days later for questions, and who called to confirm was very rude and had a very condescending tone. So much so, when I decided I needed extra linens we rented from another company. 
I have to say, the rentals from Party People did come on time, the set up crew was fine, BUT the rudeness of the customer service rep from the store is definitely the reason why we will use another company next time.",1.0
"I've been coming here for well over a year now and it's my addiction spot. The portions are large and the food tastes amazing. They do have 1\/2 orders on some of their dishes, so you may want to check that out when ordering a heavy pasta dish. I'm not big on spicy so I've stuck to the Sweet Home Alabama with fried chicken and a rich gouda sauce with barbecue (i'm pretty sure i gained 5lbs from this dish). 

If you want an amazing cold dish, I have two recommendations: Hollywood Nights, a spinach salad with bacon AND warm bacon dressing, and Walking on Sunshine, a highly addictive orzo pasta salad which is my new fav!!

Bonus: they have an amazingly friendly staff. Con: there's been a couple times were my dishes have come out different from the time before and I do like consistency, but nothing too dramatic to make me take away a star.",1.0
"This is a nice little pet supply store. I have no idea why there are negative reviews. Prices are reasonable and the store is neat and clean. The gentleman who works behind the counter has always been helpful. They also work with local rescue groups to get cats adopted, which is part of why I like supporting them. They carry a wide variety of cat foods and pet products.

The biggest issue I've always had is simply finding parking in this area. When I buy pet food, I usually buy in large quantities because I have cats and we foster kittens, so I usually need more than I can bring by bike and you'll get a ticket for parking illegally on College sometimes within 2-3 minutes because of on-foot metre maids. It's a big issue for me, because to be able to move huge bags of food and cases of cans to my car, it needs to be close to the shop, so I find I don't shop here as often as I would if there were more accessible parking.",1.0
"I've sat on this review for five days because I wanted to be very careful that it was honest and accurate.  I absolutely loved the service, staff and owner (5-star) however felt their hot dogs were only slightly above average (3+-star).  I went with two elderly friends because they were both having a hot-dog-craving; we each had a different dog (Chili Cheese Dog, Chicago Dog & a special request Dog).  We also split a very large order of fries.  None of us tried their hamburgers.  We all had their excellent Coleslaw (self-serve, all that you want).

When I first walked in I saw their large assortment of condiments (that you can put on yourself) and it reminded me of the Hot Dog Stop which used to be located a couple miles south of here, but it closed unexpectedly several months ago.  This couple (owners) used to be associated with the Hot Dog Stop and opened Lucky's shortly afterward, which explains the similarities.

All their staff and the owner (that I met) were wonderful.  They went above and beyond helping me with my 80-90 year old friends (with walker's etc.).  

My 3+-star hot dog rating has to come with a self-admission, and one that could possibly disqualify me from an unbiased judgment of hot dogs, but I grew up in Detroit (as did one of my elderly friends) and we can't help but compare hot dogs to what we grew up eating, which is probably unfair.  These were Detroit Coney Island hot dogs (i.e., from Lafayette and American Coney Island's - owned by two Greek brothers 100 years ago and located adjacent to each other in downtown Detroit).  I believe that others base their opinions (and standards) on what they had as they grew up (i.e., New York and Chicago).

Conclusion - I loved the staff, liked the food, and this place deserves more customers than were in there while we were there.  I hope they do well and I will go back.  My heart would ""love"" to give them a 5-star rating but in all honesty I felt their hot dog's deserved only 3+-star.  Therefore I'm going with the skew and giving them a 4-star.",1.0
"The modern esthetic of City Center is by far my favorite in Vegas (you can almost forget you're in Vegas- almost). Vdara itself has many positives in its favor and I would certainly stay here again. For one, its small (that's a good thing). No one wants to go schleping across a huge smoke filled casino in an attempt to find room elevators. The pleasant Vdara lobby (complete with a small cafe, bar (with a fantastic outdoor patio), and Starbucks) is perfect in size. I can glide right up to reception and than walk a few feet to the room elevators- perfect. Oh and there's no smoking in this joint. Yippee!! I can breath. I also appreciated that the hotel wasn't one giant ice box. Thank you for keeping the hotel at a reasonable temp. 

As for the rooms- I'm not sure why they wasted space on a full kitchen. You can bake a cake in your room if you so desire, although barely any pots are provided making the whole kitchen area confusing. I suppose for longer term business stays (I'm sorry you're stuck in Vegas for a prolonged business trip) it would be helpful, but I imagine most people stock the fridge with booze and ignore the cooking range. Perhaps this was originally imagined as condos that never came to fruition? At any rate, it was just weird. The bed was comfy, however there are no rooms with 2 queen beds. You have a king bed and a pullout couch, which can be converted into a bed. To my dismay I slept in the pullout couch for one night, and although it was rather creaky, it turned out to be surprisingly comfortable. 

I didn't make it to the pool (boo- all day conference and pool closes by 6pm or so), but I did book a facial (will write a separate review). Last thing- it was pretty convenient to some larger casinos- super close to Bellagio (including its tram), Aria and Cosmo. Vdara may not be the super high end Mandarin experience, but I much prefer this kind of place rather than a smoky cavernous casino to go traipsing around in. Would definitely stay here again.",1.0

"If MJ was performing live, it probably could have been five stars, but they get a solid four because of the great tribute.

My favorite part of show was the neon lit suits and dancers up in the air and on sides of walls, pretty cool. The staff was great, the paparazzi was funny, and I love the overall decor. There is a gift shop with all kinds of cute stuff to purchase. I would suggest the 2nd section of the auditorium to sit in, so you can get the entire presentation of the huge stage show. I was four rows from stage and my head was twisting like the exorcist trying to take it all in.",1.0

"Rented an RV with them for Memorial Day weekend. Got up to our campsite east of Payson, about a 4 hour trip, and find out that the batteries in it don't work. We had no lights and more importantly no heater! The whole family froze all weekend. Had to spend $400 and waste an afternoon of our vacation going to Walmart to buy warmer clothes to sleep in but still didn't do the trick. We froze both nights and had to cut our trip 2 days short and come home. I told them about it when i returned the RV and all I got was ""we can't be held responsible for something like that""? 

What?! We can't be held responsible for the equipment we rented to you not working? I spent $1,100 for an RV, hoping to have a nice (and warm) vacation with my family, you send me off with a unit that doesn't work and you ""can't be held responsible""?

"I took my mom in for back surgery and it started out great. Everyone from the admissions guy at the kiosk (who was hilarious) to the nurses in the pre-op area were extremely nice, happy, and helpful. Absolutely loved to see the diversity of the staff as well. Everyone made sure both my mom and I understood what was happening and that we wee comfortable. Very well organized and punctual.

The surgery went great, but as I watched my mom's code on the screen, it never moved. The surgery was over by 1215pm, and finally at 130, the nurse in recovery called and said that it was too full to see her, and they were waiting for a room, but I should run errands because there were patients who had been waiting since 10am for a room. What the...?

At 430pm, they finally got her to her room. Wow, what a difference! The nurses allowed the call buttons to go off forever. Her room was by the nurses' station and the nurses were so loud that my highly medicated mom had problems sleeping, even with the door shut, which also raised the temperature in the room at least 15 degrees. Not impressed with the 3rd floor AT ALL. She didn't get sent home with any kind of directions on how to take care of the incision, or any extra bandages or anything.

The best part is when the cna brought her to the car and almost slammed the door on her leg and that was after pushing on her back trying to rush her into the car.

Outpatient would get 4 stars. 3rd floor would get 1 star and that's only because her food was good and they didn't manage to harm her further.",1.0
"The National Museum of Scotland (NMS) is always one of the first things I recommend friends visiting this wonderful city. Admission is free, the exhibits are interesting and extensive, and there is a super view from the rooftop as well!

I've been many times to this museum since I arrived in Edinburgh four years ago. The regular exhibitions- comprising vast amounts of Scottish history, inventions, and stories- are always fascinating to look at. There's a really interesting section devoted to science and technology, which also looks forward to the future, and the key role Scots are sure to play in it.

As well as this, there are regularly changing exhibitions on a huge variety of topics. My personal favourite was an exhibition about amber a couple of years ago.

You can round out your trip to the museum with a trip to the café or to the rooftop garden, from where there are excellent views across the city of Edinburgh. There's a particularly nice view of the castle, an ideal photo op!

"This little place is right around the corner to my office. I previously had been here one other time and ordered a breakfast sandwich with a bagel instead of a croissant. It was good and I paid like $5.50. This morning I called ahead and when I went in to pick up the order the woman who was up front was rude to me. I was taken back by this because the previous visit was pleasant and it was with a younger lady. This time I had ordered the sandwich with avocado on the side. The total came to $8.00. Which is nonsense. I left thinking that I'd better have a whole darn avocado for the $3 extra I spent. When I arrived at work and opened up my box I found 4 small slices and a burnt bagel. I felt like I should let them know about my experience today because it really bummed me out. I normally don't complain but this was an exception. I called and spoke to the lady who sold me the sandwich and told her that I needed to make a complaint, that the bagel was burned and she began yelling at me! Lol! Telling me I was lying to her and that I can bring the sandwich back and she'd give me all my money back. I'm seriously blown away by how rude, over priced and unkind this establishment is. Please don't go here.",1.0
"SPEECHLESS! 

Ok, not really! 
We didn't have a reservation and thought maybe we could wait for a seat at the bar. We were immediately brought to a table as soon as we got there. I told them that I had called earlier and they were regretfully already fully committed. I explained that we would wait for the bar, but the man in front led us straight to a table.
The service was a slower than I would have expected. It took about 10-15 min before we were greeted or even given menus at our table. They were obviously busy and because we were lucky to get a seat, we let it go. Had we had a reservation, it might have been a different story. We may have actually walked out come to think of it... 

Anyways... 
The FOOD! Unbelievable! We had the Gorgonzola with raw honey, shrimp spaghetti with lemon and basil, the 28oz. Bone-in Tuscan rib-eye, lobster ravioli and lemon soufflé! Everything was just SPECTACULAR! The flavor so wonderful! The rib-eye was a bit too salty but the egg helped mellow it out a bit. I would still HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! It was cooked to perfection. Everything came out hot and was just heavenly! We will for sure be back. I would highly recommend it! Hoping next time we actually have a reservation, the service is running on an even keel with the food!

"I had to drop our Toyota Tacoma off one morning to have it re-aligned (ok I hit a curb) and since they open at 7am and I work a few blocks away at 7:15 this worked out perfectly. I was told they had a shuttle to take you within a 5 mile radius. Score! So, I dropped the truck off and I hadn't made an appointment but they got me on the schedule anyways. I confirmed they had a shuttle but he told me they don't start the shuttle until 7:30! I wish they would have told us when we called the previous day....ugh...I told the guy that's not good since I start work at 7:15, he asked where I worked and I said right down the street...he said not to worry we will get you there! He had a tech drive me in my truck to my office! PERFECT! They called mid-morning that the truck was done so at lunch I picked it up. The service was fantastic!

My cashier today was obviously new and I understand that people need time to learn. I get that. But this girl was left alone and was clearly NOT ready to be left alone. So after my $16 razors were scanned 4 times, it brought my bill to WELL above what I was expecting to pay. It took FOR-EV-ER to get someone there to fix the situation! And when they did show up, I was treated like ""I"" was the annoyance! Not only that, they told me I had to go to the liquor department to have the plastic security tag removed from said razors. So, I had to go to the liquor department to wait in yet another line. What rocket scientist thought this was a fantastic idea??? 

Good thing I was treated well and apologized to for the extra 20 minutes of hassle.

"In my few visits to Soga, I've had tasty experiences. A tad pricey experiences, but tasty ones.

My first meal here was with a big group and we settled on hot pot. We'd hosted our own little hot pot party a month or so prior, so I will say that the bar had been set high. A pot of boiling broth arrives to your table along with a bounty of raw veggies and thinly shaved raw meats. Chicken and pork were the selections we made for the night. The concept is fondue-esque, yet you're cooking your meat in broth rather than oil. We found the broth to be dull in flavor and the meat portions to be skimpy. The dipping sauces for after you cook the food also left much to be desired. Thus, while the hot pot at Soga was adequate, we weren't overly impressed. 

I will say that each entree I've ordered since has been great. 

The wings are perhaps my favorite option here. They're served rather spicy and with sauteed veggies and chopped peanuts. I've then tried the gyoza dumplings as an appetizer, as well as the dry braised chicken in hot pot. No complaints with the dumplings and holy spice on that chicken, in a good way. 

I also ordered delivery once and opted for the ribs stewed with pumpkin, which was impressively portioned and speedily delivered.

While Soga is on the pricier side in terms of Asian food in town, I've found the good food and hearty portions to be worth the extra expense.",1.0
"NOW $35 bucks a dozen??!!  That's 3 bucks a tamal!  They better be adding some truffles in those bad boys.  This place has definitely let the reviews go to their heads.  Their tamales are actually really good.  Great flavors, good portion, excellent masa but let's keep it real here folks.

A tamale consists of mostly masa which is very inexpensive and these bad boys are STUFFED with masa.  I understand making tamales is very labor intensive and making good tamales is an art but I am not hanging these on my walls and there is no shortage of tamale makers in AZ.

These owners are whipping that cash cow hard!  Good for them I suppose.  A sucker is born everyday right?   If you think these tamales are affordable you must either be filthy rich or have absolutely no clue on how much it costs to make a tamale.

Burger $15 + $1 for yam fries - Nothing really special to point out here. The yam fries were cut really thin and small and comes with dipping sauce. 

10oz prime rib $28 - the meat soft and tender and tasted good. Even though the size of the meat is based on weight I didn't like how thin the prime rib was cut. Most important part though is that it tasted good.
 
Prime rib sandwich $18 + $1 for yam fries - The meat was good especially when you dip it into the aju they provide. The container the aju came in was really small so you couldn't really dip the sandwich into it but instead I had to pour it into the sandwich. This made for a messy meal. After sampling parts of the burger and some of the 10oz prime rib and finishing my own prime rib sandwich I have to say I was not really full. It could be just me since I do consider myself a big eater but I felt the food was not really filling.

We came here the other day for lunch.  I went with a Double Double, both kinds of onions and we got some fries to split (mostly for my son).  It was a cheap lunch.  2 Double Doubles, an order of fries and a soda was only $11.50.  Not too bad for a lunch for 3.  

The burgers here were pretty delicious as usual but something was just a tad off with them.  I think they were more skimp on the onions, and the cheese wasn't melted and molten hot as usual.  The fries were a little bit overdone and crispy too.  I still gobbled everything up, but it didn't totally satisfy my In N Out craving like it normally does.

This In N Out is also in a semi inconvenient corner location.  If you are going East on Bell, make a right on 83rd, then bust a U turn and make sure to go almost all the way back to Bell in order to get into their parking lot.  I busted a bitch and pulled in a lot thinking it was their parking lot or that I could drive around to get into their parking lot, but you can't.  I wound up parking in the next lot over and walking over to In N Out.  Just a minor inconvenience.

"Environmentally friendly. Economical. Cool. Modern. These are all things someone can easily say about the unique Downtown Container Park. I'm always trying to convince my California visitors to move out to Las Vegas, and bringing them here is one way to do it. If this place were in SF, it would be as crowded as Dolores Park and filled with hipsters and trash. Since it's in Vegas, it's usually filled with families and very clean. I love the random performances during the course of the year. Although it's 3 stories high in some locations, the park is still pretty handicap-friendly with elevators, but some of the stores may be a bit tight to navigate. So far I love visiting the playground area, Kappa Toys and JinJu chocolates. My husband loves Cheffini's, but I haven't made it out their myself yet.

"I live at 519 E Green St, also called Skyline Towers.  While I like the look of the outside of the building and the inside of my apartment, its very clear they cut corners at the end.  For example the electric hot water heater (the entire building is electric, no gas at all), is the smallest water heat I've ever seen.  Me and my roommates can't shower at the same time or else the hot water will run out.  Also they didn't want to pay for parking spaces mandated by the city (1 per every 2.5 beds in a building) so they copped out by making the three bedroom rentals 2 bedrooms with an optional third loft space (so the building technically has less beds).  Lastly because it was a liability (aka insurance costs more than they wanted to pay) there are no heavy weights in the rec\/exercize room.  Also the pool table, air hockey table, and dart boards were clearly bought at walmart and are very cheap.  The pool table is undersize and balls get stuck in it every time, all the darts are broken for the dart board, and the air hockey table just sucks.",1.0

In total, they were selling them for about $60. When they finally told me what they could offer me I was shocked. $5 store credit, $3.75 cash. What a bunch of bull****. The games I brought in were in good condition too. I took my games back and went to BuyBacks in Mentor and got $20 cash for the games. Much better deal.

We had two separate servers asking us the same questions... at different times.  Weird.  Since it seemed busy, we ordered calamari.  I've had this in the past and thought it was decent.   Tonight it was absolutely flavorless.  The only flavor was in the dipping sauce.  No tossing in lemon or even salt.   Simply dry and dead.  

Our entrées were the prime rib special and chicken artichoke picatta.  For $26 I expected more out of the prime rib.  Ordered medium\/rare, it was overcooked and it just seemed lack luster.   My chicken artichoke dish comprised of overcooked pasta, bland chicken, and the inedible parts of artichoke.  Not worth the $20 ticket.  I would not recommend this dish. 

When receiving our $86 bill, my jaw dropped a bit.  This meal was worth $40-50, not $86.  

I give Roman's a 3 because I truly enjoy the bar and happy hour.  It just seems like it has a bit of an identity crisis - great beer, tvs, and bar atmosphere mixed with an overpriced, hoity toity back room.

The venue held on the second level of the restaurant which was away from the crowd downstairs. It was small yet warm and inviting. When we got there, there was a small menu for us to choose from for the Entrée. 

The appetizer was a platter of seafood including shrimp, lobster, crab and a shrimp\/scallop ceviche. All the seafood was really fresh. This was then followed by a hearty caesar salad. 

For the entrée, I decided on the Ahi tuna filet on a bed of spinach\/mushrooms topped with red wine bordelaise. It also came with some potato cakes as well.

Over and over I asked if there was anything we needed, I was completely ignored and told I was ready.

I always put my cold stuff together on the belt but tonight it was all separated into many different bags.   I checked the bags before leaving and had to ask the bagger to put my meat in a separate bag.  So he puts my raw ground turkey in the same bag as my cold cut chicken.  I didn't notice that until I got home.  I won't waste my gas going back, but when I called tonight to complain to the manager on duty I told him that I would sue if I was to get sick.  He apologized and that's it.  Didn't even bother to offer to even talk with the bagger.  I asked if he could give the store manager the message and he told me the manager's name is Jason and to call back.  I asked if he could and he said he would but he hardly ever sees him.  He never asked for my name and number to leave for the manager.  The people who work in the store are nice but lack common sense.  I've worked years in retail and have been a supervisor and if there was ever a problem I'd speak to the associate or leave a note on the store manager's desk if it was beyond me.   Well, I'm done shopping at this particular store.  Winco now has a new weekly customer.
The produce is terrible as well.  I can go through almost ten apples or oranges to just find one.  
I'm just glad the associates are friendly.  

If I can hear back from the actual manager and if all employees (current and future) would learn how to bag I'd go back.",1.0

"My GF lives in the area and I was wanting some Mexican food. After reading the reviews I was a little iffy on going here but decided to try it. 

Saturday evening and we walk in to an empty restaurant, we were the only people there besides the staff. That should have been a sign to leave but we stayed. 

The chips and salsa was bland. Most of the Mexican restaurants have similar salsa but theirs lacked flavor.

"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS STORE!! I was sold a Baby Einstein Jumperoo in March of 2015 and later to find out it was RECALLED in July 2013, that's 2 years ago!! I Called the store and was originally told nothing can or will be done about it. They wouldn't take it back because RECALLED!!! The owner told me to call Baby Einstein myself and figure it out. So it's ok for your store to sell recalled items but you won't take it back because it was recalled??? The owner said ""well now that you've told me it's recalled I can't take it back"" They have my phone number on file and know exactly how much I spent ($50) but finally offered $15 back. All I wanted is for them to admit they shouldn't have sold a recalled item and given me my money back. Do your homework Once Upon a Child and don't sell recalled items.",1.0

I have nothing but problems getting my lashes done by Teresa. She does a wonderful job when she does them however she canceled my appointment or is a no show more than she is there .  She never shows up for my appointments we had scheduled and she wasn't there over 3 times. She has cancelled my appointments more five  times stating  either she has to take her daughter to school or something happened at the airport with her kids and we'll reschedule but never calls me  to reschedule. Keep in mind all of this was within 2 months or less . I hate to write that reviews however I feel that people need to know this.

"As a single female I always have the nagging feeling I'm getting ripped off when I have to get my car fixed.  I'm ignorant to anything car related (other than the basics) and therefore vulnerable.  AAA confirmed my speculations last week when I went in to get my car re-aligned because it was pulling to the left, which is about an $80 job.  Instead they came back telling me it was actually a different problem... a $2,000 problem.  I decided to take it in for a second opinion at a small privately owned place in Belmont, NC.  They started with checking my tire pressure and rotating the tires. Brilliant idea, I thought!  Very common sense and basic.  After then finished their assessment, I brought up the issue AAA told me I had.  They checked it out and reported back the part AAA told me was busted was actually just weakened. I should probably get in replaced, but its not urgent.  AAA made it sound like my engine was about to fall down onto the frame of the car.  The best part was the vast difference in cost estimate... only ""a couple hundred dollars"".  When driving back to Charlotte I noticed the car was no longer pulling, indicating to me it was a simple tire issue all along.

"Wanted to try somewhere new for dinner but everywhere we went had a long wait. Decided on Henry's since we were close by and there was no wait. It's an interesting set up with an enclosed bar on one side and the ""restaurant"" on the other. There are booths and the sides and sort of communal tables in the middle. 

We were seated quickly and had our drink orders taken right away. I ordered ""The Hank"" which is a prime rib sandwich with grilled peppers and onions. Once the food arrived the service ended. The sandwich was very salty and the prime rib had a good amount of fat in it (even for prime rib). I kept biting in to large pieces of fat. 

The sweet potato tots (or puffs as they call them) were okay, nothing great. The waitress never returned. We had to flag her down for a to go box, again for the check, and again to take the check. I would categorize Henry's as bar food and not much more. Its great that its open 24 hours so if your looking for a late night snack this might do the trick.

Upon arriving and being seated Brian the Sommelier came to our table to review the different wine options. Since my boyfriend isn't much of a wine drinker and I don't really care for dessert wines, I opted to have a glass of a good white wine and a good red wine. He asked what I enjoyed in my white and red wine and during the meal he delivered both SPOT ON! I'm completely impressed, being the picky wine drinker that I am, that I didn't reject the first recommendation of either wine. 

The food just as the wine was completely fulfilling. The many flavors and foods played with the senses delivering not only beautifully and meticulously plated food but most importantly DELICIOUS food! From white sangria that melts in your mouth to the most tender and well seasoned piece of meat I've ever had. Many can argue that the portions are small and not filling. But I'd argue that it's not about the amount of food, it's about the quality and its ability to deliver to the fullest. Which it absolutely did. Chef Eric, Chef Nick and the female Chef who's name I've sadly forgotten present and served wonderful and satisfying food!!!

If I compare this experience to a well made and delivered cake...the icing on my cake was what I know as ""Cafe de Hoya.""  This was a mouth filling of warm coffee with rum and so many explosive flavors that made me almost ask for a cup of to GO!

"This review is for both Centennial Toyota and salesperson, Elton Rosas. First let me establish my credentials. I am a retired detective lieutenant from a major eastern city. I am skeptical, unbelieving  anytime the human element and money are involved. We (my wife and myself ) came to know of Centennial Toyota through TrueCar.com. Not all Toyota dealers participate. The basis of TrueCar  is transparency and the elimination of the game playing auto dealers are known to do with pricing.Utilizing Kelly Blue Book for invoice price and the MSRP on all available accessories for the RAV4 and in conjunction with TrueCar.com we had in print the total price of the car with the specific accessories we wanted and the standard delivery charges in writing and agreed upon before we ever left our house to drive from St. George, Utah to Las Vegas. I am not prone to give compliments but the following is well deserved.
Our salesman, Elton Rosas was fantastic! Right from the start he dealt with my flurry of questions and obvious disbelief in a professional but friendly manner. I was looking for the hidden costs, the up-charging on accessories, the last minute add ons and those things that dealers state they have no control over, it never happened. Everything he stated, everything we wanted, everything agreed to, everything in writing  occurred exactly in that manner. We drove to Centennial to complete the paper work , down payment, the ordering of the car in person. In addition to assuring us we would receive the rebate from Toyota, other dealers would not, everything went exactly as Elton Rosas stated. The different extended warranty plans were presented to us but we were never high pressured. Elton kept us informed as the car we wanted was located and the options were being installed in ""port"" and when the dealer would take delivery and install the other options we selected. In addition to keeping us informed I had numerous questions on the process which Elton explained in detail. When coming to pick up our new RAV4  Elton was there to greet us and stood by patiently while I examined every inch of the exterior and put the car up on the lift ( my request ) 
for me to examine the under carriage without hesitation. Then we finalized the paperwork and payment. He went on to explain to my wife all the features and nuances of her Ruby Red RAV4. The amount of time from the first phone call to when we drove away from the  dealership Elton gave us is beyond calculation. The service, the patience and professionalism he exemplified I have never seen in a salesperson anywhere! Least you think we overpaid for the car, we did not. TrueCar shows you the low, high and middle amount being paid for the car within the last 30 days. We paid between the low and middle price, $2300.00 less than 
the dealer in St. George Utah AND received window tinting and vin related window etching... Right from the start I was waiting for the deception, game playing, fight to start and the ""other shoe to drop"", it never happened. Did I mention the car was spotless AND a full tank of gas. Elton as a representative of Centennial Toyota was perfect and professional, words I do not use often!  Was Centennial and Elton Rosas this way because of how I am or is this their way of doing business. My educated observation and experienced evaluation indicates to me  our problem free new car purchase is the standard operating policy of Centennial Toyota and their staff. Great dealership with fantastic personnel !",1.0
"Amazing experience. One of the best things I've ever done.
My adrenaline was pumping for hours after this experience. 
The instructors here are really great. They first take you around the track twice in a Porsche Cayenne to show you the turns. Then you get in the car of your choice to do your own laps.

A few initial tips:

* Go early.
* Play Gran Turismo before you go with the car you want to drive (good practice)
* Make sure to do 10 laps. Anything less is just not enough.
* Make sure to be prepared to do an extra few laps for a little more money after you're done (good day of deals to add more laps)

I had Kenny as my instructor and he was great. He was giving me tips the entire time, yelling out how to go faster or slower based on the turn and adjusting my driving as I go. These guys must be even more nerve racked than you since they could be dealing with horrible drivers. Thank god I'm a great driver! I was almost too careful in the beginning and the instructor said to go even faster which I did. Somewhere along the line, I got my track laptime down to a minute and a second with the Ferrari F430. If I do this next time, I'd like to try the Lambo and the GTR.

"The park is pretty nice. A wave pool, lazy river that has had improvements which are nice, several water slides, kids jungle gym and junior ride area. The gold passes aren't as impressive, no fast passes anymore, 3 tube rentals per pass & a bunch of bring-a-friend coupons that are limited to specific days still. This is the huge upset... No water. They don't allow you to bring your own water in, and there is always a 20 min wait for the water\/ice machine and then there is never any ice!  Can you imagine sitting in the hot sun drinking warm water for hours on end?!  It's the most ridiculous thing I've heard of in the middle of the desert. Other than the cafeteria there is only one refill station for drinks. All they have done in the last 2 years in my opinion is find more ways to add things that take your money and add less value to the pass. They have added lots of stands selling bottled drinks, but they can't refill your free cups, which negates the point of having the free cups, if I'm spending extra money to get the cup I should be able to fill my cup more often and much more conveniently! I gave it 2 stars because although the rides are nice, the drinking situation is a big fat ZERO.",1.0
"Since recently taking a more serious interest in brewing my own coffee, I am willing to go in search of a better bean.  Prestogeorge is top of my list.  

I always marvel at their selection of coffees, the different types of beans and roasts.  The wall off coffee can be intimidating, but the staff is knowledgeable and helpful without being pretentious.  I started off with the JP Hearty Blend and was not disappointed.  I've since purchased other blends including the Italian espresso (which I used to make some delicious chocolate covered espresso beans) and the Vienna Roast (which I use for cold brewing).  Loose leaf tea is also available as well as brewing supplies.  If flavored coffee is more your thing, it is definitely not in short supply here.  Prestogeorge also serves beverages and some food items but I have never tried anything prepared there.  

The cost of their coffee and supplies is more than reasonable when compared to national brands available in local grocery stores.  And for coffee roasted on site where you can watch the process, you can't beat it.",1.0
"Okay, there was seating this year . Tables and chairs down at one end of the main area.
We went when it opened at 5 on Friday as the grandkids were in town. The line to get into parking was about a 10 minute wait for no apparent reason other than the parking attendants didn't know what they were doing. We had to walk about 200 yards to get to the main gate. However since we arrived early there were no lines to get in or to purchase tickets. OVERPRICED!!! $10 for each adult with no type of discount and $5 for our 4 yr old. Total of $35 to get in! For what? To watch some balloons getting blown up? We went to the face painting booth right away. Third in line and it took 15 minutes to get in. Paid another $10 for a face paint. The lady was good but seriously needed help as there were at least another 15 kids in line. Good luck with that. We found a couple of vendors giving candy out like tootsie rolls which was okay but no balloons giving out candy despite the people at the ticket booth telling my grandchild to be sure and get his candy at 5:45 when they were scheduled to start. So we went to the bouncy house area another 200 yard walk across gravel, etc. Each house required more tickets each costing $1 per ticket. Most required two tickets so I figured it was $2 for about 20 seconds worth of slide. A complete rip off! To keep our grandchild happy we bought $6 worth which occupied him for about 10 minutes including the decision time and time to move between the houses. We decided not to eat as most of the food Was in the $10 range like chicken fingers & fries. Drinks were another $3-4. We left at 6:45 and noticed one balloon giving out candy by that time but there must have been 200 kids in line. So for about 1 1\/2 hours of wandering around we spent $51 and got about 5 pieces of candy. So I'm not sure what the draw is except maybe later if they had entertainment for the older kids and adults as they had a huge stage set up. Bottom line, if you're looking for a place to have you're younger kids trick or treat and enjoy themselves look elsewhere. We sure as heck won't ever go back.",1.0

"Disclaimer: I did not stay at the Fairmount Queen Elizabeth.  I was attending a conference there and spent a lot of time with their services and conference rooms, but not in the hotel rooms themselves.

Location:  It sits atop the train station and a block away from the bus station and local metro station.  This makes is amazingly convenient for any kind of travel and tourism.  I stayed at a different location and I was able to get into the area quickly and easily.  Superb!  Also, when traveling, it is amazing to get off a train or bus and immediately be where you need to be.  That's great.

Service: I has some interaction with the customer service and general staff and they were all amiable, friendly, knowledgable, and personalities.  They didn't seem to be contained within a rigid customer service script, which was refreshing.  But, above all, they were friendly and helpful.  I had forgotten an item in a room when I left and the liaison for the conference found it and mailed it to me.  That's a huge deal to me!  Actions like these surely show that their customer service is off the charts.

Hotel Atmosphere: It's quite a nice looking hotel.  Some of the rooms\/layout aspects are confusing, but easily navigated via the escalators.  One complaint would be that the elevators were quite slow and would cause huge backups for the conference.  This was, in part, because the conference was so huge. I'm not sure what a solution would be, but it is worth a note.

"My husband and I have had very positive experiences with Cactus 42 apartments. The office staff have been helpful and the repairs needed were performed promptly. Christina at the front office has been particularly friendly and inviting in addition to being concerned with our needs and very accommodating with our unique moving situation and pets.

The landscaping is lovely and the grounds are kept very clean. The pool area is immaculate and we have particularly enjoyed sitting by the fire place in the hot tub in the evening. Many tenants have dogs but I don't see droppings or notice any smell. The maintenance personnel are friendly and greet us when walking by. 

We were able to rent the clubhouse for a family event which ended up working out very well. The office staff were concerned with the security of our belongings when they went to lunch and secured the doors and gave us a key. We have not yet utilized the gym but appreciate that it is available 24 hours.

The inside of the apartment is very modern with a nice neutral paint job- this is very much appreciated after coming from blank white walls. The interior has a warmer feeling with some color. Flooring is nice and the kitchen counters are beautiful. Carpet is thick and plush and I like the subway tiles in the shower. The washer\/dryer has given us no problems and we very much appreciate not having to venture to a laundromat. They are also behind closed doors which works well to muffle the sound when one of us is sleeping. 

My only complaint is very minor and that is the cement hallways echo loudly. It's only a problem because I sleep during the day and work nights. Otherwise I feel safe in the apartment which is gated and well lit at night. The surrounding area has lots of options for food, drinks, and shopping with Paradise Valley Mall and Costco nearby.

"I'll start by saying that I really like the open atmosphere of this place. I came in for lunch and had the tequila chicken burrito which was on special for $7. I was bummed to find out that they did not offer guacamole to compliment the burrito. The salsa was pretty bad. The flavor just wasn't quite right and every other chip was kind of stale. 

As for the burrito, no rice or beans offered with it or inside it, which would have made it more wholesome. The burrito itself just had chicken and some assorted veggies inside and the lime taste was a little strange. I may just stick to the standard bar food next time I swing in.",1.0

"Breakfast of Champions!  OK, more like breakfast of maybe semi-pros.  When was the last time you saw Michael Jordan at a Denny's?  That's right, never.  Although doesn't Shaq or Magic Johnson own a few of them?  Can't remember.

I like this Denny's location much better than the one closest to my home.  This one is bigger and the décor is a bit more inviting.  Service seems quicker & more hospitable.  Plus this Denny's turns over people at an alarming rate, especially on a weekend morning.  Long wait lines disappear pretty quick!

Not that I eat breakfast at Denny's all that often.  And really, Denny's for the most part is synonymous with breakfast.  I look at the lunch & dinner menu and I just shake my head.  Why oh why does it seem like it caters to older (much older) people?  Not saying it's bad, but just seems so old-fashioned!  So, I just stick with the breakfast stuff.  

I like cheap, and when I want an OK breakfast for chump change & am sick of $1 breakfast sausage burritos from McDonald's, I end up at Denny's.  Yeah, you go to their regular breakfast menu and some of that stuff costs you a few fingers!  More than $12 for some of their damn omelets!  $10 for a friggin' breakfast sandwich!  Unbelievable!  So I go with the little, all the way in the back of the book, value menu.  Get items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8!  More my style!  Save the rest of that money for some Lipitor prescription later.

I often opt for the $4 Everyday Value Slam - its got 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (I go with sunny side up), and either 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links (I usually ask for 1 bacon strip & 1 sausage link).  All you need for a growing middle-aged man!  

But this particular morning I was feeling extra manly and won a gangbusters of cash the night before at the casino...went home with $20 profit WOOT WOOT!  Changed that sucker for all $1's homey!  I felt like ballin' so I went with the BIG bad boy - the $8 Grand Slam Slugger!  2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (over easy this time), 2 bacon strips AND 2 sausage links yo!  With a side of well-done hash browns, baby!  Plus it includes an endless cup of coffee AND a small cup of juice...orange for me, boi!  Breakfast just got BIG PIMPIN'!

Felt like a million bucks eating this thing!  Pancakes were light & fluffy not to mention drenched in butter & warm syrup, dippin' my bacon into the runny egg yolk & ketchup just like I like to do, even the damn coffee was pipin' hot & fresh like Beyoncé's backside (yeah I got 99 problems but hash browns ain't one).  Don't forget the Cholula!  But whoa, had to knock it down a star because of the cholesterol overload!  Halfway through I was boggin' down, this Grand Slam Slugger ain't no joke!  Watch out, it'll put you down for the count!  Just too rich!  I felt like I needed some kind of vegetation on my plate to counter all of the oily goodness.  Even a piece of parsley would have been good to gnaw on.  Ended up taking a to-go box with about 1\/4 of the Slugger left.  Be forewarned - cold, rubbery pancakes make bad, BAD leftovers.

Great bargain for all the food & drink you get!  The $8 Grand Slam Slugger from Denny's will be my go to breakfast meal from now on, except I'll probably end up sharing it with the wifey.  Yeah, 2 for 1!  Save that money!  For Lipitor & a crossfit membership!  No joke.

As we were just getting settled into our seats, one of the servers quickly handed us menus. The menu descriptions were easy to read and understand.  I ordered shrimp egg rolls as our appetizer and spicy Bun Bo Hue soup as my entrée. My husband had the charbroiled pork chop that was to die for.  It was perfectly cooked and marinated. I have to say I had more than a bite of his food. My son had the charbroiled chicken which was just as delicious. I definitely recommend all those dishes. I also tried their fresh coconut juice.

Walking in, I thought they have interesting decor. Looks like fun place to hangout in the evening. Sunny November afternoon, most people were dining at the patio. We chose to sit inside.

Service was prompt. We had our water, bread, and oil and vinegar before we had chance to look at the menu. I really liked their oil and vinegar bottle.

I started crab stuffed mushrooms for appetizer.  First bite of Cheesy sauce, I thought of cruise ship dinner. I probably ate something similar at cruise. I really liked it. Can't go wrong with cheesy sauce, crabs and mushrooms.

For lunch, I ordered crab salad a half size. I know... Crab and crab but they are cooked so differently, taste different. A half size salad was just right amount of volume after eating appetizer.

I was going to skip the desert but when she brought the tray, how could anyone resist? I spotted my usual tiramisu but considering I needed to control my weight, I went for mango cheesecake.

"The best pizza I've ever had. The restaurant is small and seemed very family oriented. They have a huge selection of pizzas and the crust was absolutely perfect! I find sometimes with Neapolitan pizza, the dough can get soggy, but that wasn't the case here. Salads were great too - simple arugula and caprese salads. Wine situation was also interesting - they only have 1 red and 1 white, but for $5\/glass, I'm not complaining! They also serve free ice cream for dessert, but after all that pizza, I'm not sure who still has room for ice cream. All in all, I'm a fan and will be back!  

My only criticism - The owner was very helpful, but maybe needs to trust his staff a bit more - we ordered with someone else and then he came over and yelled out the order again, when in fact they were already preparing it.

The kids loved the train, and the staff encouraged us to explore and ring the bell.  We quietly tip-toed through the car (between other eating patrons) to the front and rang the bell while both were over the moon with excitement.

"When I thought about reviewing a mountain, I quickly thought about all the great things I have done in this world. Many great things. Then, I just threw it all away....because I am about to review a f****** mountain.

""A"" Mountain (proper verbal spacing and timing required) is a staple for many in Tempe for running and staying active. I love coming here in my morning runs and using the steep paved slope as a tool for my training. Please keep in mind that we are talking about a super-steep climb. The place is great and proper for morning workouts, but can be a pain at times for a couple separate reasons. One of the primary reasons is that A Mountain now requires payment at its base, with parking meters being installed about 1 1\/2-2 years ago. Now I have to park at the Tempe Beach Park parking lot and walk 10 minutes to the mountain if I want to work out without paying a dime. What a crock of __insert word here___! Also, the crowd you get can sometimes be unsatisfactory given space constraints at certain points.  You'll have grandmas you have to cut off and my personal favorite: ""Tad, the sports Jock from the OC who moved to Scottsdale to find himself"". You know, the  sporty jock type who will cut you off and return the favor.

Aside from these guys, its a short hike with OK views of the East Valley. I suggest this as a good hike for health-conscious locals, and that's about it. Otherwise, skip this one and go for South Mountain and others if you want some nice views. Pretty simple.

"I've been here multiple times and we've also had take out a few different nights. The quality of the food and the service just keeps being amazing. It almost feels too good to be true- like something will give at some point...but it never does. 

Each time we eat there, we like to hit the patio to watch the planes, otherwise you definitely need a reservation.

If they bottled their marinara, I'd buy it.

"I was so excited to rent a super limo from this company because of all the great reviews. I called a few months in advance and asked specifically for the Kong super limo. (I was organizing a huge bachelorette party, I wanted the pink.) 

Fast forward to the night of the event. We walk out of the casino to find the limo and there is no pink super limo...only a dumpy party bus. I didn't want to make a big deal about it because we were in the middle of the party, but all the girls were asking me about it because I had showed them pictures of the pink one we were going to get. 

I'm giving two stars because the party bus was fiiiiiiine, it just wasn't what I wanted. It smelled bad and there was electricians tape covering holes in the seats. 

I called the company the next day and they said they would find out what happened and call me back. They never called me back, so two days later I called again. The girl who answered put me on hold for a while and then another girl came and told me they didn't have the limo I asked for because it was in a car accident. She changed her story a couple times and told me at first that the accident was a week ago but when I asked her why she didn't call me and tell me she said that it happened the night before my scheduled reservation. Now even if that were true, why didn't anyone call me all day that day and tell me about my options?

"Taco Local is a new restaurant opening in Downtown Willoughby.  There have been a couple of soft openings for friends and family which have been huge successes. As with the other ""Local"" locations (the 3 Local Tavern locations, FishBar) the atmosphere is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of art to check out and the guitars and surf boards built into the decor that you see at the other locations.  

The food is amazing.  All extremely fresh ingredients and fresh tasting food! This is not another fast food burrito and taco shop - this is high quality Mexican at great prices.

"Porter House is a vegan restaurant offering appetizers, meals and alcohol  The spacing's a little tight, but the restaurant is accessible and offers gender neutral bathrooms.  Appetizers range from $9-$14 and full plates range from $12-$16.  

The space was cozy, but a little dark for my liking.  My friends and I had a little trouble reading the menus due to the lighting.  I had to use my phone.  Please also keep in mind that the restaurant is a little cold close to the door, so get there early!

When I arrived, I tried to order a coffee.  I guess I shouldn't have been surprised that they didn't have any.  As a whole, I love their menu.  If you're into draft beers, they have a great selection of local offerings.  They also have a bar rail, so you can order mixed drinks.

My table and I split the potato dumplings.  They were excellent, as was the gravy that accompanied it.  One of my friends ordered the Yuba Sandwich, while I split the Plowman's Lunch with my other friend.  I'm glad I split it, because as I observed at other tables and my own, the portions are massive.  I'm a light eater, so my only issue is that it would be nice if their were smaller meals.  I don't always want to carry around left overs.

"TL;DR: Their noodle soups (ramen, pho) are delicious, and their dessert was wonderful.

I frequent Uptown quite a bit, and so I've been seeing this place on my way to Uptown ever since it opened. Since there was the Fire and Ice event in Uptown last night, my wife and I decided to finally give Ninja City a try. I had the bacon and egg ramen with the chili garlic wings as a side, and my wife got the ginger beef pho bowl (on the specials menu) with the sweet potato tempura fries. The fries were pretty good (the chili ketchup sauce was amazing), the wings were pretty good, and the pho was very good, with the nice kick of the ginger and the beef cooked just right.

But the highlight was definitely the bacon and egg ramen. As a Japanese person, I absolutely love ramen, and often get cravings for real Tokyo ramen. While I've gone to NoodleCat several times, each time I've been disappointed (though that's a review for another time). So I walked into Ninja City with pretty low expectations, to be honest. However, their ramen was excellent, and definitely a real ramen dish. The broth was clearly a fusion version of a traditional broth, but the noodles were very near the real deal, which is the first time I've ever thought that in the Midwest (including Chicago). Definitely going back for that.

The fried ice cream was delicious, too. My wife thought it basically tasted like a freshly fried twinkie, and that's about the highest praise we can give it.

"Average at best. I've been to this place a few times because I keep forgetting when Ho Ho BBQ in the same plaza is open\/closed. 

I had the BBQ Pork and Roast Pork on rice. The BBQ pork wasn't too bad, but was definitely dryer than I've had from other places. The worst part of this was the roast pork. It was overly fatty and by the time I was finished my food, half of the actual meat i received was pure fat that I obviously didn't eat. What made it even worse was the rice, they added too much water and it was soggy. 

It's nice they give you soup or soya drink for free, but all BBQ places do this nowadays. 

If you're in the same plaza, I would advise you to go to Ho Ho BBQ. The entrance is outside. Their food is better at the same price. 

1.5 stars for the BBQ pork, everything else was bad.. just bad.",0.0

This place is a must try. I would say it's a bar you can bring your kids to if you have any. The service is great the food is better. Me and my girlfriend got pub fires with cheese and bacon to share. I got the Angry tiki and Chili dog she got the Pot roast and Big Ben  all on beef franks. The food came out in no time and with a bill of only 35$ including a beer it was a great price. They also have a massive beer cave in the back.

"Had the matcha green tea cheesecake and a Madeline. There was no line when I went (compared to the 45 min wait next door) and I had never heard of the place before so we went in with no expectations. Delicious! The cheesecake was light and almost like a sponge cake, but more moist and soft (because of the cheese). Hint of matcha. The red bean on the bottom was a great complement. Not sure I would wait 45 min, but definitely worth a try if the line is short!",0.0

"got take-out.  We sat at the bar waiting for our food everyone was so nice offering us water and bread but we could see how overwhelmed the staff was. They were scrambling and the restaurant at 830 pm, was less than half full. We waited 40 min for our food.  The bruschetta  was fantastic, the green salad was pretty basic for 9$ tasted bagged but OK. My boyfriends pizza was very good, great actually but my pasta :(.  I ordered a grilled vegetable pasta with tomato sauce. The entire thing seemed leftover and was completely tasteless. I could tell the way the sauce (max 1 table spoon for a mound of pasta shoved into a tiny container) had absorbed into the  hard greasy noodles and how mushy the grilled veggies were . Leftover pasta shouldn't be served at a restaurant and to add insult, I think instead of re-frying  it with tomato sauce to make it half descent again, they just heated it up. I wouldn't have hesitated to send it back if we ate there. I would say for 17 $ I could have made it at home,  but honestly don't know If I could make it so poorly. If not leftover probably the worst carrying out of a pasta dish I have ever tasted, someone seriously dropped the ball.   I have to say though I saw other people getting pasta and theirs looked amazing so maybe I just had bad luck here. May give it another try because there isn't much in our area.",0.0

"From my preivous dining experience with ici before, I knew how hard it was to book a table. Now that they moved to Windsor arms hotel, they made it even more difficult!

Had to took one star away because of that. 

First impression when I walked in is that the place is very very quiet. Unlike their old site, they hid their kitchen away, couldn't see chefs cooking anymore. Half of the food items were gone from their old menu. Steak tartare is tasty as before; potatoes were crispy, tartare itself was fresh. Beef carpaccio was a bit disappointing as it was too salty. We also shared the grill platter. Beef was cooked to perfection, chicken was moist, fried calamari was crunchy. Last but not least, souffle!!!!! It was so light and fluffy! Yum!

"You're strictly paying for the ambiance here. The decor is gorgeous. However, I found the food to be pretty blah, with the exception of the hot & sour soup. The soup was really good. Even with the spicy dishes that we ordered, we found the food to be bland. The chicken chow mein was particularly unimpressive. My local Chinese restaurant is leaps and bounds better than this place. I have no problem paying good money for a nice meal, however at $150 before tip for some mediocre Chinese food is insane. Do yourself a favor and skip this place. If you are in the mood for Japanese food, I highly recommend the teppanyaki at Shibuya located inside the MGM.",0.0

"I like this location because it's close to work and truthfully, I never tried it until last year because all along I've been a fan of the other pizza guys. But then one day out of curiosity I went in to try a slice and have been hooked ever since. 

For $4.10, you get a really big slice of pizza. It's about the size of two of the regular pizza slices you get down the street. It's also the same price for all the varieties and they sure have a lot of varieties. I'm always holding up the line trying to decide what to get. The Hawaiian and the one with two types of olives is really good but I can't remember the name of it right now. 

Here's how I break down the rating.

Value 4
Taste 4 depends which one you get
Fresh 4 if you go at lunch, they have fresh out of the oven pizzas due to high turnover
Service 2-5 depends on who is behind the counter. One guy was super friendly and the other was not at all and just stood idly and didn't both to help even though there was a line forming and asked for my order multiple times before he rang me in. 
Cleanliness  3 again this depends on who is working behind the counter. I have noticed them putting the pizza cutter right by the counter where they put the money... eeeek",0.0

Overall, good deal. Fri night  34.95. 3.5stars
 Prime rib was excellent, mad flavor, super tender, good quality fat. A little  peppery on the outer rub. Mashed potatoes were delicious. 
  Chile Verde pork was fantastic!  Could be a Lil more tender, but it definitely not tough. Frijoles were very tasty. Spanish  Rice was ok. After meal I made some Bomb nachos with the beans, green Chile pork & cheese sauce. 
  Sushi was buffet grade.
 Beef ribs were very tender, a bit too sweet with tons of sauce,  but wipe em off & they're pretty good. 
  Crab legs were just ok. 
Chinese food was generically aight, best bit of that was the dim sum, Ha gao.  Shrimp was tender & tasty. 
  try the Phø next time, looked pretty good.
Dessert-  bread pudding was amazing, best we've had. 
  Super creamy but firm, not drippy or tough. Very sweet vanilla & cinnamon  flavor with soft apples too take any edge off. Didn't care for the raisins though,  just set them aside. 
  Lemon curd tart was also excellent.  Tart but not sour, very smooth & sweet. 
 The flan was horrible,  don't get that again. 
 The mini banana pie had no flavor. 
Chocolate pecan cookie was good,  not too sweet.

"I only go here for the palak paneer and the butter chicken. If you like palak paneer - this is probably one of the best I've ever had at this location. Spices are right. Extremely flavourful though portion sizes are small. One of the best Pakistani places I've been to. If you have kids, they serve decent portion size kebab with fries for about $4.50+tax I believe. Great alternative to fast food and it will fill them up if they're under 13. I was surprised the fries weren't just regular cut fries. The skin of the fries have a kind of crunchy look to them and tasted good. Service was great too, though we waited 15 mins for our food. Friday nights after 8pm seem to be less busy.",0.0
"Loved it! A weekend in Toronto and stumbled upon the doorsteps for Brunch. It's literally the first floor of a townhouse and the ambiance is comfy. It's a small place so reserve or prepare to wait a few minutes. As for the food, the chef knows what he\/she is doing. The Florentine on brioche is amazing! A friend ordered the Chef Omelette which was so delicious. Will definitely go for another round when back in Toronto....",0.0
"There are so many appealing items in the case it can be overwhelming for a first time visitor to this wonderful Armenian bakery.  You should definitely try one of their excellent macaroons, available in more flavors than you can shake a stick at.  Definitely get a slice of the Bird Milk cake.  It comes in roll shape or layer cake form.  Just get both.  You won't want to share one of these.  Definitely get the Russian cake.  The Russian cake is quite dense, two people could possibly share a slice.  Get a couple Bird Milks, a slice of the Russian, and a random third slice of cake and you're going to have a damn good time.

"I had never tried Mama Lolas before so I got a few different things. Nothing was really all that good.  The chicken tenders are frozen processed compressed chicken. Tasted like rubber, inedible. The fried oreos tasted like burnt chocolate. The pizza was alright. Mediocre. I also got the mac and cheese bites and they were alright but I've had way better pretty much everywhere else ive had them. And lastly I got garlic parm wings which were equally as disappointing. I ordered extra crispy but they were slimy and gross. Wasted 10 bucks in them because I couldn't even eat them. The sauce was alright but not much parm to it. Pretty much just butter. Overall I feel as though I wasted my money because I wasn't pleased with anything I ordered. The staff and customer service was great though.

"I went to the body blitz class for the first time today and Kevin was leading the class. The class is a mix of cardio and strength exercises that lasted about 1 hour. There's only short breaks between stations so your heart rate is kept up the whole time. For those who aren't active regularly, this class might be too intense. I did find the exercises a bit tricky but that's because I skipped the ""genesis"" classes which they usually recommend going to first to learn the techniques and build a foundation.

The size of the classes are fairly small - about 10 people per class. There's two people who goes around to make sure you are properly doing the exercises. The location of the gym is so hidden. I had a very hard time locating the building since the entire plaza is on this small road with limited street lights. The signs are also not lit so it's quite tricky to find this place.

"First time visit last night & we were absolutely impressed! We joined another couple for Happy Hour at 4:00pm & were seated at a very large booth in the bar area the moment we arrived which was great because it was pretty busy & continued to fill up to capacity. 
Lauren was our server & was at our table the minute the hostess left, she asked if we wanted to order drinks\/water which was appreciated since the other half of our party was running late & we were ready for some refreshments. Cold water arrived immediately, drinks followed within minutes which was a surprise since, again, it was pretty busy!
As soon as the rest of our party arrived Lauren was back to take their order, within a minute or two. She took care to answer the boys questions about the large variety of beers & made some helpful suggestions, she mentioned that she was a bartender as well, so she was really informed on the bar offerings. She returned less than 10 minutes later with the additional drinks then answered questions about the menu, again offered a few suggestions. We selected the Farro Salad & Dip Duo, both arrived within five minutes, both had great flavors and nice presentation! Lauren did not hover, but did check in to see how we were doing, we sent her away with more drink and food orders...round two! We ordered 2 orders of Crispy Ahi Tacos, Crispy Cauliflower, Wild Mushroom Pizza and another order of Farro Salad (it was THAT good!). Again, everything came out very quickly & was perfect, each item was a very good size and did well to fill us up! We even ended up with a free order of Speck & Eggs due to the fact that one of the other servers mixed up her tables & had an extra, they were tasty as well!
Lauren checked in on us a few more times & made sure that we had everything we needed, all in all we were there over three hours and she never made us feel that we were holding up a table, she was a perfect server & we will ask to sit in her section the next time we come.

With that said. Very enthusiastic and helpful staff. Great music. Great people. Great drinks. Even better food. 
We came with the little ones a few times and the servers even offered some mocktails for the girls to make them feel belong. 
The only complaint I will ever have about this place would be the parking situation, at peak hours or on weekends do expect to be several blocks away for street parking.",0.0
This place has the best salad by far. I am so not a salad person :) but the Santa fe salad is to die for. I love coming here with the family or on a date night. It is very hard to find places where the kiddos can eat and enjoy being themselves ....you know just kids and this place is on my top for both. Oh and the service is outstanding. On a date night my husband and I had some drinks and where chatting along when we didn't realize that the food was taking a little longer than usual (mind you the place was pact) well the manager came over and apologized for the inconvenience and gave us a huge discount! !!! Way to feel welcome :),0.0

"Wonderland is Wonderland, there isn't much to say about it.

There's not really anything here in the GTA that is like it, and nothing can compare.

Wonderland will always be, just like anyone else here, part of my childhood. I've been coming here as a small child, and even recently a couple weeks back. I'll be honest ... It's not as fresh and exciting as it once was when I was younger, but I still enjoyed myself!

Great sweets, souvenirs and even carnival games. But the ONE thing that always gets me when coming here, is the food prices. Wanna eat at Teriyaki or Pizza Pizza for almost triple the price? Then come to Wonderland. Honestly, I understand why they do it ... But come on.

The server knew we were not happy but could care less",0.0
Definitely recommend!!  The spices that compliment the shrimp and crawfish are on point!  It is a bit of a messy meal so you may want to reconsider coming here if you plan on doing something afterwords.

"Was a little unsure about trying Buddy's pizza plus I am happy I did though not only do they have great pizza and their tuna pita was delicious, but they also have a reasonably priced kids menu which is great for my picky 4 year old who loves something one minute then changes her mind the next.  We also enjoyed the  Atmosphere of buddy's and all  the old character pictures . This is  Definitely one of my new favorite places to eat!!!",0.0

"First of all the owner and groomers  are really professional, courteous and  nice. The owner took his time with us and was very patient and helpful with our very nervous foster dog.  Our foster dogs coat is thick and was matted and extremely dull and in desperate  need of a  bath.  They did a great job....he is shining,  his fur feels so soft and luxurious  and he smells great too!  When we picked him up a groomer went out of her way to explain some things with us  which tells me she really cares. I loved that when you walk in it is  wide open to the grooming stations and kennels so you can see your pet (and they see you!) and everything that is going on which I think is really important especially for your pet.  I would strongly recommend using this grooming service.",0.0

When I arrived at the shop on the day of my tattoo Anthony was very professional and made sure I was happy with the design, which he creatd custom for me about a week before my appointment. The whole experience was great! He helped make the 5 hour tattoo tolerable and all around enjoyable.",0.0

"Hardcore Halaloos love this place.
Those who aren't hardcore Halal don't.

See, the problem is their steak and other high priced items are pretty meh. Pretty ho hum average. 

But their hamburgers, chicken burgers & sandwiches and philly cheesesteak are epic especially at that price point.



The good:

The burgers\/sandwiches are priced the same as McDonald's but the quality is exceptional for the price.
Seriously the cheesesteak (only available during secret lunch menu is unreal)
The grilled and fried chicken burgers are amazing.

Shout out to P. Reign for being my unofficial sponsor. Unofficial cause he don't know me yet. Anyways on to this restaurant review.

I'm gonna sum this up really quick and for people that wanna know what I think here it is;

Food - 3\/5
Service - 1.5\/5 - I am being very nice with the .5

For the rest of yall here's my in depth review. Fun fact about me when I was in school I never wrote reviews cause I was a badass and ain't no person gonna tell me what to do.

So it was a Sunday during brunch we walked in at around 1:30 so it was packed we stood inside for at least 15 min for somebody to acknowledge us, and that's after I waved them down. They're lucky this wasn't in the hood or else - guys, we all know what would've happen...I would've waited patiently at the door cause I'm scared of the law. 

So once we were waiting for a seat my friends asked the bartender for a drink the lady at the bar said ""I'm the only one at the bar and I have to serve my tables before I do anything"" pretty rude because a normal
Bartender would've just said sure just give me a sec. We're asking for a drink not to milk a cow. Anyway so we got our seats and then ordered our food. I had the eggs Benedict they were good but not much depth in flavours. I felt like it should've had a little more of a saltier taste. And also had their drip coffee which was recommended by the waiter as he told me it's really good. I had a sip of it and it was very light coffee, and I'm not going to criticize the coffee as maybe some people like it light. 

Overall it's a nice place to bring a date or somebody from cragislist as there's a hotel right beside the place. The developers of this area really thought it through. But all jokes aside if you bring your girl make sure it's an extra special occasion as the bill will rack up and you'll be discussing financing options with your waiter.",0.0

"We visited Roland's on Sunday for an early dinner and drinks. The hostess at the front felt her conversation about another customer was more important than greeting and seating us. It took about 5 minutes for her to even acknowledge out presence. After we were finally seated, it then took another 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order, in fact, we were just about to leave when he made his way over. I didn't think it could get any worse....but it did. He brought us waters first then our beers, little did we know these were the only drinks we would get. The restaurant's doors were open and the day was hot and humid, perfect for enjoying a lobster roll and cold beer. Our waiter brought our food, we ordered a second round and he was never seen again. I witnessed more apologies to customers that day than I ever have. It wasn't even crowded. Having my own experience in the food service industry, I realize how hard this job can be but this was unacceptable. The type of service you receive will make or break a restaurant and I highly doubt we will be back. This was our second terrible visit and I am not willing to give a third strike chance.",0.0
"We went to Roys for the first time tonight. Everything was good. The service was on point. As far as the food, we had Lobster California roll and Ebi roll were great starters. My wife had lobster bisque which had a great curry type taste. For main courses we had the Braised short rib, yukon mashed and greens. We also had the lobster, shrimp, crab cake trio which was really delicious. It is definitely worth checking this restaurant out if you are visiting Vegas.",0.0
"We didn't even make it to a table. Father's Day morning. We put our name on the list (45 minute wait... fair enough) and stepped to the side out of the way. We were then informed by a hostess that we needed to wait outside in the blazing heat because being in front of their display case (which had some gnarly looking shit on display... it looked worse than Waffle House) is a fire hazard. ???? F you. Off we went to eat somewhere else. Bye, Felicia.",0.0

"Called in to review a bill.  Got a guy in France and had some language issues but he tried to transfer me to the credit dept to dispute a charge but instead transferred me back into the standard support queue.  by the time I got to the second support queue and transferred to a credit person, I have spent 40 minutes of my Saturday having frustrating conversations.  The credit girl, Chelsea, who loves to talk over you and interrupt what you are asking because she assumes she knows what you are going say, basically told me that she could see in the notes that I called in on the night of a PPV fight and told them I couldn't see the fight.  They told me that I would not be charged for the fight.  I said I might call back the next day to pay for it if I wanted to watch it then.  I didn't do that because we all went to a Buffalo Wild Wings to watch it.  Chelsea said that because I didn't call back in the next day she wasn't going to credit the $60, which shouldn't have been charged in the first place.  I told her that I have been a 15 year customer paying between $225-  $290 per month and she may lose me over the $60.  She said OK.  That is just unbelievable to me.  I then initiated a chat online in support, and asked if they had a customer ""save"" or retention team as I was getting ready to cancel service if I couldn't get something resolved.  Her response was that she couldn't help me cancel service online, but gave me the billing dept number to call and they could cancel my service. Wow!",0.0
We have been here for one hour. There is under 20 diners in the restaurant and are still waiting for our dinner. There are 5 of us. Finally received Luke warm dinner. Ordered a margarita and actually had to call the bar and ask when I would receive my drink after waiting ten minutes for it.,0.0

"I visited during Summerlicious and they had a great pre-fix menu... I mean scargots, shrimp, lobster, Rib steak, etc. 
When we got there they made us wait in the bar, we were there for 5 minutes and the bar tender never came to take our order, she gave us a menu and looked at us while drying some dishes... never took our order, I really wanted to try a Martini with Hyptonic... didn't have the chance and by the time I got to my table I changed my mind. 
Service was great, our server made recommendations, the sommelier and the manager visited our table as well, I have to say they are fast and make suggestions.
I definitely recommend the shrimp martini and the carrot cake (even when it tastes like clove) the cream cheese frosting works well with it. My lobster was a bit bland, something regular and totally expected. Nothing new or great to comment. Mashed potatoes with wasabi weren't my style but my husband liked them, they are not spicy, but a little bitter for my taste. He ordered rib steak with truffle butter and it was outstanding!!! great taste, perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Amazing!

My dessert plate was dirty and even when I don't tolerate this things, they were very nice and speedy about it and brought a new one. However, I do think they have an area of opportunity with their dishes, you can see stains on them from the dishwasher or something...

I ordered the Santa Fe salad paired with the Blonde Ale. It was very refreshing beer and I felt no harsh aftertaste. The salad itself was great! It was large enough to be a meal and filling. It includes chicken and this made it more appealing to me.  I don't like salad dressing so although I ordered it on the side, I didn't pour it over my salad. My dinner companion ordered one of the flatbreads. I believe he ordered the Venetian paired with the IPA. It is a large dish! No complaints from him!

When I decided I wanted to change it up and go ombre, she took the challenge on and now I'm rocking an awesome style that gets complimented almost every day. Thank you, Jaime, for rescuing me from my platinum nightmare and making me feel more naturally beautiful.

"After seeing pictures on Yelp about this place, I decided to have breakfast here.  When we arrived at Bellagio, we had a hard time figuring out where the store was.  Well, it turns out that this place looks more like a fast food joint, rather than an upscale restaurant.  Anyways, the menu on the wall only states the selection of crepes and drinks they had.  It did not mention anything about their sandwiches or breads.  Well, since we're here, might as well buy something to eat.  The line was pretty long.  By the time we got to the front of the line, we saw sandwiches and breads so we ended up ordering 2 sandwiches.  Both sandwiches were pretty good but it's nothing to rave about.  I couldn't even remember the name...I'll skip this place the next we're here.",0.0
"Had a lovely dinner here with my hubby. We shared the deviled eggs, an order of ribs, the chicken biscuit sliders, mac 'n' cheese, then got the deep fried oreos and butterscotch cake for dessert. The stand outs to me were the deviled eggs and the ribs. The deviled eggs had a lot of dill in them, which I love with eggs. The ribs were tender and sticky-sweet. Definitely get these. The sliders and mac 'n' cheese were good, but didn't blow my socks off. I didn't care for the butterscotch cake, so most of it was left on the plate. The oreos were good, but I don't think the desserts are as strong as their food here. Service was friendly and they were very accommodating to me when I asked to be relocated from the high top tables to somewhere where my feet could touch the ground. We were moved and a new server slipped right in to take our order without missing a beat. Be advised that the entree portions look huge! Hubby and I stuck to the small plates, but the table next to us ordered entrees and I couldn't believe the size of them. Come here with an empty stomach!",0.0

I've been wanting to try the noodle bar (and the milk bar!) for quite some time, but I was always a little hesitant because it seems like such a hipster place to go. And let's be honest; it is. BUT...once you get there,  the staff and service is just plain great. Our server was super helpful, very chatty, and full of great advice. In fact, the service was fantastic!  I had the Extremely Spicy Noodles. I was warned by the server that it's one of the spiciest things in the city. THE CITY!!! That is (allegedly) some serious spicy shit!!  Well...I'm glad I took a chance (after a lot of internal debate) and committed  to it (which is more than I can do with a relationship!) because although it was very spicy, it was also very flavourful and really really yummy. My companion had the signature ramen, which was amazing! We both had the pork buns...oh my god! So good!  Anyway...my point is: definitely go! Even if you're afraid of hipsters.",0.0

"Friday night 4\/17 we decided to try out the Rio's Carnival World buffet, after a long day and wanting to grab a bit we walk in and the lady asks us to stand to the side to take our picture, when asked why she just smiled and said ""please stand over there"". We requested not to have our pictures taken which she pretty much refused us to get into line until she took two pictures. Paid $78.00 for two people and tried to keep up with the hostess who, at one point we almost lost as she showed us our table. She never looked back to see if we were following her just raced over the table with her arm up in the air waving her hand back and fourth. The server was very nice, he was prompt with our drink orders but I've been a server and the last thing you want is someone coming over to you every five minutes asking questions. 

I wouldn't choose this place again. I sampled plenty of things including chicken, steak, and seafood (which had more nice than anything else), Asian rice, vegetables and something was off with just about everything. Either the taste was wrong or the texture is weird, maybe from sitting too long and not being fresh as most of it is frozen. The chicken was chewy and the lack of spices makes you wonder if the food was expired. The food was not great at all, had no flavor and was ridiculously expensive. They really need to work on the quality of the food as opposed to the quantity. The only thing that was halfway decent was a dessert. 
I've NEVER left a bad review, I've never left a restaurant so quickly mostly I've never had the experience of such horrific dining, from walking in to the food. Not to mention the two of us ended up not feeling too well afterwards.

"They seem to get poor reviews at all their locations, which must be a management issue. I have no complaints though. I have been to a couple of their locations and staff has always been great, and I love their pizza. It is one of my go-to places. Their antipasto salad is awesome too. :)",0.0

"This is a great place to have a meal. My husband and I drove in from so cal and stopped here for a much needed rest and lunch. We sat at the bar so we could watch a little golf and Matt was our bartender\/server.  He is personable, polite and engaging.  The food was awesome.  The mahi tacos were delicious as were the mushrooms sautéed in port   The tortilla soup was selfish as well. Definitely recommend!",0.0
"Finally had a chance to try this restaurant near my area. So first of all, the proximity to my place wins points especially in this cold weather. The place was pretty packed, I wonder if they all live around here. It was very noisy, very hard to hold a conversation across the table. We were seated in a round table between the 4 of us, I was only able to hear the person next to me talk. It was like playing telephone, the next person had to pass the message to the next in order for all of us to know what is going on.

Now for the food, we got the arugula salad with fig, pear and hazelnuts. It was pretty good but very small portion. We also got the squash fritter - it was fried squash mixed with some other things that I couldn't identified. I didn't really taste much of the squash and it was pretty blend without the chilli sauce.

For the main, I got the papardelle con funghi - mushroom pasta. The portion was ok, expected a bit more for the price. I don't know if it is because winter and the dish gets cold faster but my pasta got cold after a first few bites.  It must have been the chanterelle mushroom, I don't think I have had it before, but it has this sweet \/ sour taste to it that made it awkward taste to the pasta. It was still pretty good but not worth the price I paid. I will try another dish next time. They have a few daily special menu that they change every few weeks on top of the regular menu. So there are new things to try.

Overall, the service was good, the food was so-so, price is typical downtown prices - my pasta was $18, mid-range . The atmosphere is dark\/romantic and noisy, not a place to go if you have a lot of venting to do. I might try for brunch next time.",0.0

"I was apprehensive at first with this restaurant. It's hard to seat five or more here as most tables seat four. As I had been away on orders for the last month I wanted my first drink in a month to be something worthwhile. And alas the the twilight drink with gin was on the weak side. However once seated, the lady was more than happy to bring me three saucers of tasters for the soups! Such hospitality, I was enamored. I had ginger beer and their signature gin. Great choice of soups, buffalo wings and pizza. The food is by far the best a chain can offer. Each individual restaurant might have it's hang ups as far as service but my experience was great. I know my in-laws enjoyed their carbonara. I loved my lentil soup. The gin straight up and dirty was excellent. I'm happy to take home their margarita pizza the best in the business with shredded basil instead of full leaf I believe adds far more flavour. Great bathrooms and layout to boot.

"This place is HORRIBLE on every level. My husband and I got takeout from this specific location one time. I had stuffed mushrooms with a turkey burger, and he had some sort of salad with a turkey burger. As he was eating his salad, he noticed a bug on the lettuce he almost put in his mind. Mind you the lettuce was halfway in his mouth, luckily the bug fell off before he consumed the whole thing. He literally spit his food out, and I did the same. He took all our food back - and the manager tells my husband ""well there was a bug in your food because it's humid outside"". For crying out loud there is NO excuse for live bugs to be in anyone's food!!!  He offered a cheesecake which of course my husbanded declined. Several years later we tried takeout again from this location. Don't ask why, because honestly I have no idea why. We should've learned our lesson the first time right?  Well my poor husband again had another horrible situation. As he bit into his turkey burger it was completely raw!!!!!  That was the last time we've ever been to Cheesecake Factory. And mind you the kids pasta was awful. Felt like they took the noodles out of the box and threw some butter on top and didn't bother cooking the noodles. Do yourself a favor and just eat at home, or at least stay away from this Cheesecake Factory.",0.0

"Six of us met here Saturday evening before heading to see live theatre. Place is steps from the St. Lawrence Centre for the arts. 
The restaurant has a casual, upscale ambiance. We started with drinks and appetizers. Drink offerings are very diverse and well paired to meals. Complimentary bread, baked onsite, arrived to the table warm and toasted. 
For main courses we tried the Lamb Burger, albacore Tuna and beef short rib entrees. All were beautifully presented and so flavourful. Paired with fresh herbs, vegetables and exotic ingredients such as coconut milk, it was a meal that will last in our minds for some time. To top things off, for desert we tried the chocolate deluce and lemon custard with coffee. Absolutely wonderful.

"I give Tofu Hut 5\/5 because it is my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ in Las Vegas.

The prices are fantastic, $16.99 anytime and $13.99 for late night (10p-2a). I would recommend just ordering the $16.99 whenever you go because you'll be able to get the garan-jjim (steamed egg) which comes out sizzling hot and the kalbi (marinated short ribs). 

It's a pretty popular AYCE KBBQ as I don't recall a time I haven't had to wait for a table. There's two sides to the restaurant, one where you can order all you can eat and the other for those who prefer to order off of the menu. I've tried both and am a fan of both, however, I prefer Tofu Hut for the Korean BBQ. 

The service is good; they bring you out waters, banchan (Korean side dishes), salad, and take your order shortly after being seated. They give you salt and pepper in sesame oil for dipping sauce but you can also request for the soybean paste or soy sauce and vinegar if you like. There's always plenty of banchan provided, which are very tasty, and the servers happily refill them when requested. I love the salad they give you here... The dressing is amazing and the salad pairs perfectly with the BBQ. 

Tofu Hut does not compare to the Korean BBQs in LA, but for Vegas... It is definitely the place to go for AYCE KBBQ. 5 stars for me and highly recommended!",0.0
"I tried a fair amount of rolls (Crunch Roll, Mountain, Spider, French Kiss) and the portions were fairly large and filling. The atmosphere is nice, it has a very authentic feel to it.

A friend of mine had the chicken terriyaki bento box and said it was amazing so definitely the next thing I plan to have when I go back. There's a ton of variety so still lots of things for me to try.

In terms of price, it's a touch on the expensive side for a frugal student like me but still not too bad. The taste and service makes up for it.",0.0
"Sushi Kaya is my favorite place to go for sushi. The quality of their food is very high for the price. Sushi Kaya offers all you can eat at lunch for $20 and dinner for $25. They also give you a stamp card that gives you a free all you can eat every 10 stamps.

Their sushi rolls are the best thing about Kaya. They have a large variety for everyone's taste palette.

I highly recommend the Sex Bomb Roll, Cinderella Roll, and the Volcano Roll. 

The nigiri is tasty too but not the best I've had in Vegas.  

What I also love about Kaya is they offer everything for all you eat including pot stickers, skewers (the bacon wrapped scallops are great), soup, edamame, and more!

"We were nervous, first time home buyers who wanted a very specific type of house, in a very specific area. It was also very important to us to make a good investment. Daniel was great and very informative from our first meeting. He was always available to us, honest, helpful and friendly. He is very knowledge not only about the neighbourhoods we were considering (Danforth, Leslieville, Riverdale), but also about the structure itself of a house. He knows what to look for when viewing a house, the possible red flags, concerns, or the things that are an added value. Viewing a house with him is incredibly informative and as you're walking around, he is looking at it with 'professional' eyes. He's not just there to 'show' you the house, he's actually analyzing the house. He is also an expert when it comes to multiple offer listings (aka bidding wars). We ended up jumping on a great opportunity (my reco is when you find a house you love DO NOT HESITATE!) and Daniel helped us get a house UNDER asking (WHEN DOES THIS EVER HAPPEN IN TORONTO) and got the seller to agree to pay for 50% of a small repair that we were not anticipating.

"$$ - be careful for extra charges. We were charged extra for another item and when we had the cashier (male) check our receipt, he appeared to have to purposely up charge us and still trick us by the way he reviewed our receipt twice in front of us. However, we stood our ground and he realized his mistake. This resulted in no tip and -1 star. 

Food - I ordered the penne a la vodka, which includes bacon. This dish was very heavy and saucy. The ratio of pasta to sauce was 1:2, which made the dish overwhelming. Having half a plate of leftovers packed to-go, I still had half a plate of sauce left. I don't usually order pasta with vodka sauces but I wanted to try something different tonight. In my opinion, the taste was good but could have been better if there was less sauce. My boyfriend ordered two slices of pepperoni pizza. He liked the taste but he thought it was too cheesy. He also enjoyed the garlic knots, which comes with marinara sauce. I thought they were a bit doughy.

It was in an overly sweet bakery type shell which was tasty, but dammit I'm tryin' to eat healthy.

All meals were of such low quality it's laughable.  The grilled panini was so bad we are still talking about it 3 days later.  

Food was almost uneatable and the service was awful.  There's no reason to ever eat here.  Just look at the pictures... this food looks like it was prepared in a microwave.  What a joke.  

They try to make this place seem exclusive by letting the line run out the door... when we finally were seated (even with a reservation) there were like 300 empty tables.

"This place is perfect.  I don't understand how you could review this place anything less than 5 stars. It's extremely delicious, the portions are large, and the price is unbelievably cheap. Should be illegal how cheap it is. I often tip extra just because I don't think the price is fair. My favorite thing is basil leaf fried rice and pork jerky.",0.0

"I stayed at this hotel two times in October 2014 and June 2015. It has a very good price\/quality ratio since it is usually pretty cheap (around $60 or $70 a night without the resort fee) and on the strip. The rooms are reasonably big and the hotel staff is pretty helpful.

The hotel amenities are acceptable, but it lacks a club and a day club which most other hotels on the strip do have. The fact that it is on the strip partially offsets that, since it is pretty easy to go to the MGM next door or to other hotels that do have clubs and day clubs. The casino area in the hotel is also very small compared to other ones on the strip or around downtown Las Vegas.

The parking lot is free, like any other one on the strip, but it is a little far from the hotel's entrance so I would definitely recommend using the bellboy for your luggage. 

Overall, my experience with the Tropicana was positive and I would recommend it if you are looking for a cheap, but nice, hotel on the strip in Las Vegas. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!",0.0
"When the tire pressure light came on yesterday I stopped in to get the my tires checked.  I found out that I had picked up a nail in one that was sadly in a place that could not be fixed.  This was not good news to me as I am on a very tight budget.  The guys seemed like they were trying to be helpful.  They quoted me $100 for a new tire, but then said that since my tires were new enough they would instead sell me 5 warranties for $90 and save me some money.  I wish I would have asked a few more questions, but it sounded like a good deal so I said yes.  They replaced the tire and I was on my way.  When I got home and looked at my statement I noticed that the tire they put on was only $67.  I do not appreciate being lied to.  As a result I will not go back.  When it comes time to buy new tires I will be going to a competitor.  They may have gotten an extra $23 out of me on this visit, but they have lost a customer who has been loyal for 15 years.

"It's a small joint, busy joint!  I went we a friend. ...she likes the place. .so i gave it a shot. I have definitely had better food! I had mango lassi which i liked. . My friend had a masala\/ salty lassi . We both got thalis. I got chilli chicken...it had gravy....but still tasted good. .except the curry was pretty runny and i had lamb curry as well ...i really like lamb. But i have had much much better lamb than this place. The lamb was hard. So the nonveg thali combo is you get  2 non veg curries and 1 veg...for veg i wanted to have paneer...they had 2 paneer dishes. ..1 sag paneer in which i could not see paneer and the other one was matar paneer...i missed the whole dish all together ..just dint see it until later. So anyways. .i went with aloo baigan...which was pretty good but mild for my taste. All the food i had here was mild.  The rice wasOK and naan couldbe softer but was still OK. The thing i least liked about this place was their presentation of food.  The least you could do is not let curry run all over the plate that it looks so messy and drippy that you don't feel like you are eating at that restraunt. You gotta be very careful with all that runny food. I mean the quantity is good but i don't waana be worrying about the curry spilling all over me given the chances are high in that jam packed place. The arrangement of tables was not good either. .. me and my friend sat side by side cause if we had to sit facing each other a person would have had to get up everytime we needed something and wanted to get out. That entire row was blocked just cause that person sat at the opening end. It'snot his fault isthe arrangement  that needs bettermenr. The arrangement is very casual so we could make it work for us but this place would do better having their staff serve than self service and better seating arrangements. All in all..OK good. ..good staff..good lassi..i don't think i waana go there again except for the lassi perhaps..Or may be to try other stuff on the menu not the thali though. They do have some variety here, also sweets. Those might be interesting to try.",0.0

"Went last night for restaurant week and was very excited to try based on reviews. I have to say I was extremely disappointed. Granted it was the last night of restaurant week, but the service was pretty bad. Our waiter seemed distracted and had to ask us to repeat our order twice. Also my boyfriend ordered a second beer ( had first one at the bar) and he didn't get it until after the apps arrived. For apps we have the gnocchi which was VERY salty, and eggplant which was okay. For dinner I had the scallops which were over cooked and rubbery. My boyfriend got the ny strip, which looked more like a chuck steak when it arrived. Very thin and the color was not nice and browned. Had to wait almost 10 minutes for a wine refill, oh and they forgot to give us bread. Dessert was fine, but nothing spectacular. All in all a very disappointing experience and we will not be back.",0.0
"This place is quite nice and has a nice modern interior design. Very inviting and the server that we had was helpful in terms of the menu. 

Their bread is awesome. Good for sharing.l and as a starter. 

Prices were affordable, not too bad. Then I got the chef's special. I was really contemplating getting the Mac n cheese and I should have done that because the chef's special was not so special at all. The battered fried fish was smokey and way way too salty!!! It was horrible. Each bite I took, I had to down it with water. I wasn't the only one who found it too spicy. A couple of people on my table who ordered the same thing had the same comments about. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. I tries my boyfriend' s grilled octopus and it was delicious. Great bold flavours in there and the potatoes were delicious with it. Lastly, we had the poutine pizza to share and it was AHH-MAZING.  That one I was really happy about.

I would definitely come here again to try the mac n cheese now since I didn't get it last time. But for my first experience, it was decent. Just really disappointed  about the chef's special. I'm going to give them another chance to redeem themselves by trying it out again and going for their best dishes. Hopefully my rating will change for next time!",0.0

We explained that wasn't what we ordered and had to ask many times for them to redo it. They also forgot to bring out our rice, when we asked for it they came back with a cold rice, I'm assuming was from a buffet.

"I started going to this barber shop because the one I would normally go to was closed while the owners were on vacation...not a great business plan in my mind. So my first impression was mixed when I first walked in...it seemed that everyone only spoke Spanish. That made me concerned that whoever cut my hair might not understand what kind of haircut I wanted.
The wait time was very short, and walking in without an appointment, I was in a chair within 15 minutes. When the woman asked what kind of haircut I wanted, I explained and she replied in English that she understood.
The haircut was very quick and she used the clippers like a seasoned pro. I was very impressed.
She used both clippers and scissors to get my haircut just right. In fact, she did a better job than the previous barber shop I had been going to for 12 years.

"Cafe Fresh is my favorite place in the food court.  Its the only place with healthy options and there's a lot to choose from.  There's something for everyone, whether you're simple and want a pineapple smoothie, or you want something harder to come by like a dragonfruit smoothie bowl with coconut shavings or an avocado smoothie.

I usually get the sweet cheese crepe with strawberries.  Its strawberries, some type of cheese, im thinking maybe goat based on the texture and taste, and powdered sugar.  Its delicious. You also have the option of banana, but I've never tried that.

I ordered a strawberry juice here once, and I wasnt impressed. It's definitely better to go with a smoothie. 

As far as food, I forget the exact name, but I've ordered the salad and the panini that has chicken, bacon, avocado, and ranch.  I definitely liked it better as a salad.  It was a nice size for six dollars and I have no complaints about freshness.

"Came here today for a shopping trip. I haven't been to Yorkdale since the renovations. The food court itself has a really good variety of food choices. We decided to try the food at Chipotle.

"WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD. Never in my life have I had such a bad experience in a restaurant. Milestones completely lost control of their restaurant last night. It was actually sad to watch. We were taking out our family who just arrived from Ireland earlier that day, to somewhere I thought would be 'impressive', god were we wrong. 

First of all we ordered drinks- It took 25 MINUTES for our waiter to bring them out. We stopped another waiter in the mean time and asked him why it was taking so long, his response was 'we are short staffed and super busy' and that there 'is only 1 barman', 1 BARMAN in the whole in bar. We then proceeded to order our food (I thought in my head that the food can make up for the drinks taking ages). The food came out after a long 50 minutes. It was all STONE COLD. All the steaks were rare, after we asked for three medium and one well done. They mixed up our order bringing out three mash potato, instead one meant to be with fries . ..  The fries that they did bring out were BURNED TO A CRISP and looked like they had been cooked over and over... AND there were forks and knives missing from the table.

At that point for the first time in my life I said we were sending this crap back. I wouldn't have fed it to a dog. It was completely inedible. We called over the manager and told her exactly how we felt, we told her to taste the steak. She completely admitted defeat, saying repeatedly' I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, your totally right. its a disgrace.' In my eyes I think that the manager should have stopped people coming in the front door, obviously knowing she had completely lost control of the restaurant. She then tried to win us back, offering us drinks, another meal and vouchers. We said no, honestly all we wanted to do was get out of there. I told her that I  would never come back again even if you paid me. So we walked out still starving.

Stay away from their philly role, teriyaki roll was plain, and tuna roll was great. Their Chinese food section could have been better. I did enjoy their egg rolls though. My husband complimented on their pizza in the Italian section. I enjoyed their dessert a lot right up until I had the pistachio pudding (super plain). I love their red velvet cake.

Tonight we went for dinner again, our server was Alexa (pretty sure that's her name) she was awesome! She made sure to explain everything to us, and double checked everything was good constantly. She has exceptional customer service skills, she kept making sure my daughters were satisfied with everything. When she took our drink orders she added that if we needed anything like warm water (to warm milk in bottles) or a warm rag to clean them up, just to let her know what we needed to accommodate them. I should add that my daughters were also very fond of her.
My kids love eating here! It is such a fun and loud environment, and they sure do love being loud and having fun! Going to dinner is usually such a hassle with two little divas under 3, but this place makes dining with children so easy. And to top it off great prices!
So to wrap this up in my opinion the service and food both were 5 stars. We will definately continue coming here for a delicious and fun family dinner!",0.0

A GOOD MORNING from the guys at Break Masters # 122 made my day.

On this night my friends and I went for a quick meal before going to piranha. We ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (I HAVE to order this every time) it has a little spicy kick, the chicken, shrimp and red bell peppers are what makes this dish my favorite. I can't get enough go try it. I believe it's $15? I also ordered a raspberry mint patron drink. Very good but I wouldn't recommend it with the pasta- too much acid. This drink was $10 probably would've been cheaper to just get a drink at the casino! Lastly the only flaw I have is that if you don't sit at the bar when they have their half off drinks, you don't get them- unless you walk to the bar and pay every time. They should just make it half off no matter what I'm sure they would sell more!

"Ever since Daily Kitchen opened I have wanted to try it. Being a fan of ""au naturale"" eateries, DK is as good as I'd hoped. Upon entering it suggests that trendy modern meets organic kitchen feel that has been become more popular. Dark green booths and black utilitarian chairs paired with wooden planked walls definitely holds that back to the earthy basics vibe. 
We ordered a DK Relief shot (Apple, ginger, lemon, turmeric) which was super fresh and yummy tasting. I also ordered a turkey burger that is was delicious! Probably the best turkey burger I have had in awhile. Generous amounts of avocado, tomato and sprouts stacked one on top of the other, was quite satisfying. Sweet potato fries are also included. My friend ordered the DK acai bowl and said it was really good, better than the Jamba Juice version across the road. 
My bill for DK juice shot, turkey burger and a bottle of aloe water was $17 and change. 
I'll definitely return to DK, next I'd like to try the Pitaya bowl, chicken tinga tacos, ahi tuna tacos, soba noodle bowl or turkey chili with quinoa. The smoothies and other juices look pretty yummy, too. 
They have long tables with plug-ins for your laptops or cell phone chargers, it is a casual atmosphere that is nice for lunch with friends or for doing work on your laptop and grabbing a bite. They have breakfast, lunch and dinner options.

"I've never had mushy gyro meat before and I never want to again.  We walked in and there was a man at the grill BANGING on these slabs of meat, I thought it might be chicken or the pita and couldn't figure out why he was banking on them like that, but when I got my gyro, I realized it was slabs of gyro meat that he was hitting to make flat and then he would cut them.  Gross.  Not how gyros are supposed to be made!!  Fries were good, but not worth going there for fries.  My friend had a salad, but the feta wasn't crumbled and there was hardly any dressing on it.  Won't be going back.",0.0
"They have a summer menu with about six items on it, no more.  The items were hamburger, two standard fish items (salmon but I don't recall the other) a couple sandwiches and that was about it.  No steaks, no seafood, no lamb and there may have been one chicken item.  When we first sat down, the bartender came to our table as she doubled as both server and bartender.  I asked for an Absolut on the rocks, they don't have Absolut either.  Didn't matter, we left.  That cut the number of people at a dinner table by 50% at six thirty in the evening on a Sunday.  It cut the number of people in the entire place by 33% as there were a couple people at the bar.

"I'm normally a fan of Aloft hotels but this one didn't meet my expectations. I guess if you want to stay as close to downtown Charlotte as possible this is the ticket, but otherwise it was a bit of a hassle. The place is difficult to find, since it's basically on top of a mall. There is no free parking--Only $25  a day valet and $20 a day garage (with no in and out privileges). I get that it's in a dense part of town but the SPG website didn't make this fact clear. At $200 a night for the hotel I didn't find unexpectedly having to pay that much for parking acceptable. The place is also pretty loud due to its location. Otherwise it's pretty much your standard Aloft so if you like the brand you'll feel at home. The rooms and common areas were clean and well maintained though, which of course is always nice.",0.0

"I ended up getting the Groupon deal - which was a fantastic steal - 16 classes for $22. The Groupon first off doesnt state anything about there being a restricted schedule - just that you have 16 class pass for Jazz and Hip Hop and then a link to the schedule. When my friend and I went in to take our first Hip Hop class, I saw a schedule (much like the one online) but with different text stating that there was a restricted schedule for Groupon users. I took a look at the schedule and quickly went online to make sure I didnt make a mistake with the web version. After I concluded that it wasnt stated on the schedule I spoke with the cashier explaining what had happened. The cashier refused to let my friend and I into the class, not because it was full, but because they just dont do that. After arguing with him, he concluded that 
""This happens all of the time with the groupon and our policy is we don't make exceptions... ever"" 
I continued with him and said that they should make exceptions and then fix the problem so it doesnt keep continuing and people dont waste their time coming down to the studio and then asked to speak to a manager. At first I was told that the manager doesnt speak to anyone. After a bit more persistence I was able to get the cashier to go and get the owner. After about 10 minutes, the cashier returned saying that we should have contacted the studio before we came, at which we would have been given the appropriate schedule. I had called.... nobody answered. And after all the reviews on the groupon site I didnt think I would have been treated so poorly by a company, especially as a potential future customer.

"We received a letter in the mail that stated we should come give their pizza a try. So I took them up on the offer, it seemed like a little man trying to compete with big business. We received a large pizza, a salad, breadstix, and a 2 L for $16.00!!

We received the food, took it back to our place, and it tasted awful. The sauce, cheese, and dough had no flavors what so ever. The pizza was bland. The cheese was most likely a single blend that just honestly tasted like plastic. 

The breadstix included a garlic butter and a red sauce, however they also lacked flavor which in turn made you want to douse them in sauce, which was also flavorless.

The salad was a really good salad, which included a bunch of veggies, however only included one packet of dressing....

"Having worked so closely to this pub the last 5 years, I finally decided to try out this bar. Came here on a cold Friday afternoon with a friend for a quick lunch. We were seated immediately as the restaurant was not busy. The restaurant is huge and offers many tables and booths. 

My friend and I decided to share their signature Fish and Chips and boy was it a great idea, the portions were massive! The fish was tasty and juicy, however, it was a bit greasy.

It also happened to be Fish and Chips Friday meaning that aside from their signature Fish and Chips, they also served other types that are not usually offered on other days of the week.

The calamari was hot and crispy and tender, the veal and eggplant parms did not diappoint and the grouper picatta was delicious. What spoiled the experience for us was our waiter.

I've ordered from here over a dozen times and in terms of flavor, this has to be one of the worst Chinese restaurants around. It's on par with mall food court food. Again, considering the price, delivery speed and service, mediocre food is good enough.",0.0
"Best Bloody Mary EVER - The BLT Mary!!! Pretty sure they hand-picked the freshest, juiciest tomatoes and somehow married them with bacon flavor to come out with this spicy\/savory mix.

"OMG AMAZING!!! The meatball sub and the cheese steak are so incredible, I have a tough time choosing between the two any time I go.  The pizza is awesome as well. I have yet to try a pasta dish (just can't get past those sandwiches) but they always look really great.  The store itself is so fun, lots of really great specialty Italian items.  The desserts and salads, etc. in the case for purchase always look fresh and delicious.

To top it off, the staff are polite, friendly, quick and super efficient!

I take family here whenever they visit, and everyone keeps talking about it for weeks.  Definitely my favorite Italian spot in the valley.

"Benvenuto's is a charming little restaurant attached to the Holiday Inn. The service was friendly and cheerful. In deciding what to have for supper, the server was able to describe the entrees as well as the garnish. This is important, as my wife has many sensitivities. They start you off with a little focaccia bread and you prepare your own dipping plate. My wife ordered the scallops with risotto. The scallops came out with a fantastic sear, hard to get in some of the best restaurants, but no problem here. The Caramelized Onion Risotto was fantastic. I ordered the Rib eye and it was perfect.

We had no time to move her out. My Cousin was in a serious bind and needed a storage right away. All of her things had to be move out that evening.

Then he wrote down their address, phone number and directions for me so I could go there to purchase the tube I needed.  What a wonderful thing to do!!  He was so nice and wanted to be sure that I did not drive back to Phoenix (where we live) without a tire tube.  I will return to Free Ride ANYTIME I need a bike or accessory.  Great Service!!!",0.0

Five stars tapas are as follows: stuffed dates (ON POINT - I mean seriously on POINT! ), merguez (couldn't ask for better lamb sausage - savory with right amount of spice), empanada (NOT the the chicken tinga), chicken and chorizo stuffed mushroom,  juevos estrellados (it has really good spice but only order to get full...carbs will help fill you up)

"Pretty good SDM for being right downtown. The staff are usually about as friendly as they normally are at Shoppers. Take that how you want. 

I've used the pharmacy service a number of times and while they are not the friendliest people in the world, they are quite professional and willing to help. 

The Good:

1. Location. Finding a good SDM downtown can be challenging but this one is a one stop shop in a great location. 
2. Size. The size of his location is great - not too big, not too small - and with the added bonus of an OK sized grocery section. 

The Bad:

1. Lines. Because of its location, there is constantly a line up both at the cash and pharmacy - best not to go at lunch hour as it is about 3x worse. 
2. Stock. They tend to be out of stock quite often but the good thing is there are lots of other locations not too far.

I won't get into details, but I have evidence of what we were promised, and still haven't gotten. We were in the store and signed up August 4th. Installation isn't happening until August 21st (how does it take 17 days?!?!). Samantha Castro (the person who signed us up) is dishonest. I approached her with several issues and she told me to contact AT&T on my own. She said she had the best technician (Willie) to do the installation for us, but I had to contact him on my own. I called him last Thursday, he said everything would be fine for installation this past Saturday, but he'd call me on Friday to confirm. No communication since. I called him. Texted him. Nothing. I've contacted AT&T corporate, and they're telling me that what we signed up for isn't what they have on file. We were told that having wireless phone would make our package cheaper. When we finished placing the order in store, we were told it adds $20\/month to our bill, and billed separately (was told when we left it would be $20\/month going forward). Not only that, but we just got a bill for the wireless home phone for $78.71!!! We signed up less than TWO WEEKS AGO!!!

I am not eating carbs so they gave me extra veggies (asparagus, mushrooms, and spinach...my favorite veggies!) instead of the mashed potatoes. Everything was seasoned exceptionally well. The fish was a large portion, tender and a bit crispy on the bottom which was wonderful. The asparagus was cooked through and more the tops of the asparagus (best part) and not all super chewy like I get some places. There was plenty of food for me and it was down right delicious. The wait staff was very attentive and sweet. I picked my own table and it was a 4 top, and they did not complain at all even though they were a bit busy.

"I go to 24 carrots very often because I love their fresh, healthy, unique dishes! One of their servers is also extremely nice and helpful! The reason I am here writing this review right now is because multiple times I've gone to 24 Carrots, the service has been absolutely terrible! Today when I went there was the straw that broke the camel's back! We ordered two sets of pancakes, but when we got them, they appeared a bit burnt. It wasn't until we flipped them over that we saw how really burnt they were! How can you even serve pancakes that burnt to your customers?! It was obvious that the cook had to have known he had burnt them too! He just tried to hide it! Then when we asked if they could remake them, the servers were very apologetic and understanding, but as we watched the servers tell the cook about the mistake, he raised his hands in the air above his head in annoyance! Why should HE be mad that HE made a mistake and now has to fix it?! We ended up getting new pancakes that were better and weren't burnt. I love 24 Carrots so much, and it pains me to write a bad review, but after several instances of bad service, it gets old, and something needs to change! I didn't pay $20+ for burnt pancakes! I hope things change for the better because I don't want to experience this anymore.",0.0

The burgers came out in a reasonable time, and were pretty good. They were cooked exactly how we liked them. We also ordered truffle fries which came with two different dipping sauces: a siracha ketchup and a garlic aioli. The aioli was not that great, and smelled kinda weird. The other one was pretty good. 
They also have a decent beer selection, though it mirrored mostly what Vegas establishments are selling at the moment. (As of now, you'll see about the same 8-10 beers at any bar).

Nothing wrong with Perry's, but it's nothing special, and it's widely available elsewhere.

"I'm new to Vegas and found Better Dental on Yelp...nothing but awesome reviews, so why wouldn't I go there. I have to say from the minute I walked in, to when I left....GREAT! Very professional atmosphere....receptionist was very pleasant and the hygienist was awesome and very knowledgeable. Dr.Miller was extremely kind and also super knowledgeable....but knew how to explain things to me and educate me, which is what we need to maintain the work they do to our teeth !

"Brothers Pizza saved my life. 
After ordering my usual boneless chicken wings with garlic Parmesan sauce, I decided to order a special sandwich for later in the evening. OK you take some philly steak (no onions), add bacon, add more bacon, bake with buffalo mozzarella, and add some chipotle mayo for kick. 
Anyway, this there's this badass Eastern European guy named Alex who shows up with my order. Kinda looks like Vin Diesel, but with hair. I don't remember what he was wearing, but it doesn't really matter for this review. Get over it.
Might've been a black shirt and jeans.
Anyway, Alex shows up, but between him and me (or is it ""I""?) are these Amish gangbangers threatening me with happiness and simplicity. 
Anyway, then these Tibetan monks showed up, wielding enlightenment and oneness with the universe. The gangs had a Zen off.
Anyway, Alex made his way across the minefield of peace and understanding, got me my food, and gave me a high-five.
Thanks, brothers pizza. You totally saved my life.",0.0
"We had fried chicken with green onion, and crispy fried chicken wings.

The green onion one has a good sauce and tons of green onions. They are fried particularly well too. Although the pieces are cut too big for my liking.

They threw in fries with the wings so that's a nice bonus.

A truly memorable dining experience. I had Paul and Joseph at my waiters and they were great.",0.0

I'm going out on a limb here and saying this place deserves 5 stars just on the nachos alone. I know the signature dish is the puerco pibil, this will have to wait till my next visit. I was pleasantly surprised to have fresh spinach and blue cheese on my nachos platter. The cheese tasted like it was gourmet home made cheese. I like the story how authentic Mexican dishes with French influence plays a roll in the dishes served. Keep in mind this was what they served at the Phoenix Airport location. I really need to stop by the downtown location. My only complaint if I had one was the price being a little on the high side. $40 for two beers and a nachos plate. Honestly, you get what you pay for here though. I would totally do it again!

Be sure to know that you'll likely be waiting in line for a while.  Even if it's 3am in the morning on a Sunday this place is still packed.  The service isn't the best and they do make you pay first before you get your meal, but who cares it's all about the poutine here!

"I ordered an iced coffee. I waited patiently for over 10 minutes. Watched the girl make a few blended drinks for other people. I try not to blurt out & interrupt them because i assume these drinks are coming out in some sort of order. & ive been standing right in front of the counter where they clearly keep looking at me. Finally, when there are no more cold drinks to be made the barista asks me what I'm waiting for. Makes me tell her my whole order as if she's never seen a ticket for it. It takes all of 20 seconds to make & she hands it to me without even a ""thanks for your patience"". So I say to her ""that was a really long time to wait for this"" she looks me straight in the eyes & says ""yeah....I saw you standing there. That's why I asked what you needed. Sometimes tickets don't print."" She shrugs & stares at me. No apology, nothing. I left highly annoying. I really shouldn't be annoyed over coffee, but I am. Even if you don't care about customer service- at least pretend to care. Offer a lame ""sorry about the wait"" even if you don't mean it.",0.0

"After having spent months spoofing Torontonians with potential concepts such as God Bless 'Merica, Cakehole and New Delhi Burgers, this Queen West joint finally revealed itself to be Nana, Monte Wan (Khao San Road)'s newest venture.

Khao San Road, along with the Sukho Thai were the pioneers in elevating Thai cuisine beyond your ketchup-y, chain-quality pad thai.  So naturally, Wan is sticking to what he does best.

The decor is reminiscent of the streets of Bangkok, with the Thai flag and various bright-colored banners hanging above.  The restaurant seats about 30-35, mostly communal tables and a few seats at the bar.

The cocktail menu was crafted by Bevlab and are Thai-inspired versions of your classics like the Jatujjak ""jin & juice.""  Most of the descriptions lead me to believe they would all be syrupy concoctions, of the Karaoke bar-variety so I ask the server for the least sugar-laced one.

He suggests the Bang Rak ($12), a star anise-infused vodka concoction with ginger syrup, lychee nectar and grapefruit bitters.  The drink arrives at the table and perhaps my alcohol tolerance is just higher than others, but it still errs on the side of sweet and if it's the strongest drink they've got - I'm going to need a few more.  Despite that, it's a delicious drink.  But the Chang lager is just as good a bet, and wonderfully refreshing.  Added bonus?  It's only $6.

Similar menu offerings from Khao San Road are seen, such as the khao soi, albeit the Nana iteration subs chicken for beef.  There's pad Thai bolan, and when prompted as to what bolan means, our server tells us it simply means ""authentic.""

We order the Southern fried chicken laab ($12) to start, an offering straight out of KFC Thailand's books.  It's similar to Taiwanese popcorn chicken and I absolutely love the different combination of sweet and salty with citrus notes as well.

We then order the fresh rolls with pork ($8) which are not as refreshing as their Vietnamese counterpart.  The rice paper is double-layered, the presentation more sushi than fresh roll.  I preferred the rolls better sans dipping sauce as it allowed you to actually taste the spices in the pork.

For our mains we skip over the khao soi and red and yellow curries and opt for the Chef Top's fried rice ($16) with chicken, topped with a crispy fried egg and a side of fish sauce.  The addition of basil really does add a bit more oomph to an otherwise pedestrian plate of fried rice.

We also opt for the mi ga ti with pork ($15), a peanut and coconut milk based curry that reminds me of everything I don't like about restaurant Thai food - the broth is too sweet.  The coconut milk drowns out any potential peanut flavoring to be had and as I ladle spoonfuls of the curry into my mouth, I can't help but think of the che dau that my grandmother used to make at home (a Vietnamese dessert of glutinous rice and black eyed beans doused with a generous ladle of coconut cream).

The dishes we order aren't particular spicy, but there was a tray of chilies in all their different iterations available - fresh, dried, fried and in vinegar.

We ask the staff what the ""Special""roti ($8) is, but are denied any explanation beyond ""I'm sworn to secrecy but I can promise you that it's good and that you'll like it.""  He'll have to add this deception to his list of laundry items at his next confession as we are sorely disappointed.

The saltiness of the roti dominates and the little bit of condensed milk drizzle fails to save the day.  If only the seasoning of the mi ga ti pork and the dessert roti could've been reversed...  The server comes back to ask us if we liked his recommendation, we tell him ""unfortunately not.""  Oh well, at least we know a portion of the proceeds will go to Meal Share.

The much better bet is to go for the Thai tea gelato ($5).  You get three scoops and its definitely not as sugary as the actual drink itself.  While I am normally disappointed by tea-based desserts as they seldom pack in enough tea flavor - this one did not let me down.

There were a few hits (mainly the chicken laab and the Thai tea gelato).  But I still prefer Khao San Road - even if it means having to wait in line.",0.0
"I have been to Ashley numerous times as they are close to my home and until a few months ago had done a good job.  There is one nail technician that is downright dangerous.  She did my pedi a few months back and scraped the top off of a bony protrusion on the side of my foot (these are not rare).  Seems she thought it was a callous.  It was sore and a little bloody but healed within a couple of weeks.  I went back with a friend in late October and was assigned the same tech.  My friend and I were chatting (forgot to supervise her) and sure enough she went after this protrusion like it was a big callous.  When I looked down all I saw was blood and she was frantically putting blue fluid on it.  She got the bleeding to stop, finished my pedicure and did not offer a discount or comp - just a quick ""sorry.""  When I got home it was getting very sore so I took the band aid off to find a hole a little larger than a dime and very deep given there is not much there besides a layer of skin covering the bone.  Long story short - I could hardly walk in shoes for about 2 weeks and it took about 2 1\/2 months to heal to the point I was not in pain.  It is now mid March and the hole has closed and I am still getting peeling.  I wish I knew who to tell you to stay away from but I don't know her name.  She should not be allowed to do nails - period.  She is dangerous and I am fortunate my foot eventually healed.  I will be looking for a new place.",0.0

When I got home and started eating, it became evident very quickly that the chicken used to make our food was chock full of bones.  I mean like every single bite had bone in it.  I had to chew very carefully to make sure I didn't stab a bone into the roof of my mouth, or swallow one.  The curry sauce was delicious, but I found it very hard to enjoy this meal with bony chicken meat.

"Decent ESSO compared to other gas stations in the area.

But there are 3 major drawbacks:

1) They mix water in the windshield cleaning fluid. So when the temperature is around freezing or below, the windshield service is useless!

2) Only pumps 1 through 4 which are right in front of the cashier's station are open to pump first-pay after 24hrs. The rest of the pumps are set to pre-paid between 10pm & 6am!
Either open them all like Petro-Canada or have the cashier take payment through a stupid hole in the wall like at most Shell gas stations.

3) Given its location at a major intersection and with the T&T behind it, it's difficult to get in & out any time of the day or night with the sheer volume of traffic, and be prepared to be cut off by rash & reckless drivers while you line up behind a car to pump.",0.0

This place has a little bit of a sentimental value for me since I have been eating at this establishment since I was sixteen years old.  Adrian's is a tiny little piece of Mexican food haven right off Main St. in downtown Mesa and if you're driving to fast you might just miss it.  You walk in and there is maybe eight tables to choose from but well worth the wait if there is one.  I used to go in on Saturday mornings after a rough Friday night and have their chorizo burrito to make me feel all better.   The service is fantastic and the owner is a true artist in the kitchen.  Sadly a little while back I moved far away from Adrian's but I still catch myself dreaming of their amazing green chili and Mexican coke-colas.  Adrian's is an inexpensive treat and I miss it so much just writing this review makes me want to travel across the Valley to go get some.,0.0

"Food was great, we were given samples of our drinks and as a first time Peruvian food eaters... The food was great. The salad was a my personal favorite along with Wonton Soups.

Understandable people have bad days at times, but good lord, when someone is telling you they are new, please don't have a crummy attitude to explain or to even serve. Will be going back for the food,but the service can use some help. Be thankful you have a job, may not be a dream job, but you're healthy and well enough to work. Attitudes are not needed or if someone goes up to your desk you pay attention and ask if something is needed, don't simply ignore. That was tonight's service and my child ignored as he had stuck a coin in the tiny toy machines and nothing coming out.

"Nous sommes venus dans le cadre de MTL à table ! Je précise que les plats que l'on a pris sont des plats de la carte donc vous pourrez les manger toute l'année et ça c'est cool :)
J'aime bien le restaurant en lui même, rien de spécial mais je m'y sens bien car c'est pas trop grand et la musique est cool. En plus la musique est d'ambiance donc pas trop forte : comme quoi à Montréal il faut aller dans des restaurants non nord-américains pour parler normalement au restaurant :D
Au niveau du menu nous avons pris tous les plats proposés donc on pourra faire une review complète ^^

En entrée nous avons pris l'ajiaco qui était succulent : soupe de poulet avec avocat et crème. Ayant mangé des ajiaco en Colombie je peux vous dire que ça se rapproche pas mal même s'ils sont moins bons que ceux de ma grand-mère ;).
L'autre entrée était Cachapa Julieta (plat signature de Julieta) Maïs en galette, crevettes pochées, huitlacoche (champignon mexicain), sauce zucchini-chèvre : miam miam miam !!!
Superbe premier service.

Pour le plat nous avons pris le plat national mexicain (Chile en Nogada : Piment poblano farci avec porc et bœuf, fruits, sauce crémeuse aux noix, pomme grenade) et un plat de poisson (Poisson Titoté (Riz caribéen avec noix de coco de la côte colombienne) Vivaneau, riz à la pâte de coco brûlé, bâtonnets de manioc frit, sauce coriandre et noix de coco légèrement épicée).
Le piment farci est un plat aux saveurs surprenantes. Le tout se marie très bien et je trouve que c'est une des originales et belles découvertes découvertes de la soirée.
Le poisson était vraiment trop bon, toutes les saveurs allaient super bien ensemble. On sent que le plat est recherché et travaillé derrière. Rien à redire !

Pour les desserts je me suis jeté sur le riz au lait avec la glace au fruit de la passion maison. Super accord avec un coulis spécial qui ne voulait pas être relevé par le serveur et dont on devait trouver au gout. J'ai trouvé instantanément (like a boss), à vous de jouer ;) Si vous aimez le riz au lait foncez !
Le pudding à la courge avec les fruits confits était bon aussi !

"went to the pool party this weekend - and it was AMAZING! This venue was SO much fun. Everything about it was perfect but most importantly, our cocktail waitress Hannah. Cabana 47 this past weekend - she was nice, quick service and I feel like really made the experience for our group. The other team members helping her out were also amazing, had some great conversations with them and really felt welcome, comfortable and fabulous at the cabana.

Loved it. Made a reservation for 13 (work function) and got the banquet room in the back. Atmosphere was fantastic. They had The Godfather playing on a tv with the subtitles on. The entertainment was on point with a solo crooner performing with a digital band...he was outstanding. They also had a roaming magician working off of tips. I hate to say it but he was incredible lol. Thought he was going to be annoying but I was pleasantly surprised. The only thing I would have changed would be the chairs in the banquet room. Way to low and not very comfortable. The food? Off the charts good. I had the Chicken Anastasia and grilled veggies. SO on point. Everyone is se enjoyed their dishes as well to the point that everyone was talking about it the next day. I brought my wife here a couple of nights later and it was just as amazing. Highly recommended for tourists and locals alike..,0.0
"Desert West OB\/GYN totally disrespected me and therefore I suffered from severe depression regarding the birth of my second child. My first child, who was born in another state, was delivered by an emergency c-section due to my having an allergic reaction to the epidural. I became very depressed because I wanted a normal birth. My OB there told me about Vaginal Birth after Cesearan (VBAC) and said I could have this with my next child. I got pregnant 8 years later and we were living in the Phoenix area. Unfortunately I chose Desert West in Glendale. They assigned me a Nurse Practitioner who seemed to make all the decisions about my child's delivery. I told her I wanted a VBAC and she vehemently refused, citing uterine rupture. The OB complied with this Nurse Practitioner and did not respect my wishes either. They told me I would have to sign a release form to get a VBAC, stating that I would not hold Desert West liable if something negative were to happen to me or my baby during the VBAC. Both my husband and I got scared and complied with the repeat c-section. The Nurse Practitioner even decided the birth date and scheduled the c-section. All the doctor did was cut me open. I had a tubal ligation after that birth due to my age and not wanting anymore children, so I will never experience a vaginal birth. I talked to several women after my repeat c-section who had VBACs and said they had no problems and no hassles from their doctors. They said vaginal births were a much better way to deliver and that I missed out on a great experience.  I have been very depressed about this and had to seek counseling, Desert West may be OK for Pap Smears and the like, but as for childbirth, be sure to go somewhere else that listens to you, respects you, and that's more compassionate.",0.0

"WARNINGWARNINGWARNING

I don't usually type up bad reviews but I felt compelled to do so for the shit experience I had with this restaurant. 

First off Ill go with the good, we had a nice server named Jen, but either she is new or she just takes too long to handle situations. 

The shit, the food service from start to finish was crappy. First, we order the appetizer combo, spinach dip, and calamari. And I gotta say, nothing tasted fresh whatsoever. The appetizer combo is greasy with your standard onion rings, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and fried zuchinni. Next the spinach and artichoke dip was ok at best but the chips were really stale, even though the manager said it was made to order, it is not. And finally the calamari is totally frozen and you can tell that from the taste of it. 

And finally our entrees, we ordered the ore cart, chicken and brocolli pasta, and the pork and beef ribs. They all come with a side of soup or salad. We decided on clam chowder until I noticed a thick film around the chowder. This shit has been sitting on the stove way too long. Its salty and real thick. Our waitteess says thats normal but that is complete and utter bull shit. Clam chowder never has a thick film around the top layer. So I decided to change it with a salad, which was pretty much pre-made. And finally we got our food. When I received my pork and beef ribs they looked decent until I felt them. They were really fucken cold! Like if the food inspection put a thermometer through the meat it will definitely be unsanitarily out of code. Anyways, I told the waittress about this and she told me that this happens alot. WHAT!? This is when shit hit the ceiling. I got my plate back less than five minutes which would probably mean what? Yeah you guessed it, it was probably microwaved and you can that from the taste. The pasta was really dry and overcooked. And the beef ribs were not tender or 'fall off the bone' at all. 

While the manager apologized for the poor food service. We told him about the shitty food and he looked surprised about this shit. And asked to give us free dessert. And we were foolish enough to take it. If I were you, I recommend to clear the bill and dont waste your money on this shit hole. 

I feel like this should be in a dinner impossible or kitchen nightmare. My suggestion is if its a convenience sake just either go to yard house or ale house in town square. Any chain restaurants are better than this. You're better off going to chilis, TGIF, apple bees, and outback than this overpriced piece of shit of a restaurant.",0.0

So we came by again & he did give us the $5 off and even threw in a free tempered glass screen protector. He was extremely helpful and told us we had a 30 day warranty on the screen.

"I wish more than anything else to have a bar like this at home.  This place has a super thorough collection of hundreds of board and card games for you to try, plus a full bar and food options, all for $5 cover.  It's a pretty popular place though, and we've seen lines of up to 30 minute waits on Monday & Tuesday nights.  

It is a full-service spot, which means there is waitstaff to take your food & drink orders, and game masters to help pick out, bring you, and -- get this -- introduce and walk you through how to play each and every game so you don't have to struggle with the instructions and spend more of your time laughing and strategizing with your friends.  All of the staff there is super friendly and the vibe of the place can't be beat.  

Their menu is straightforward but covers a wide gamut -- they have sandwiches, salads, nuts, olives, gummies, nachos, beer, wine, shots, hot drinks.  Though I can't really speak to the food there, I offer fair warning that their pulled pork nachos ($12 CAD) is easily one of the worst things I've ever ordered anywhere in my whole life.  Like plastic on cardboard, no exaggeration.  But that didn't ruin our night at all; that's how amazing this place is.",0.0

Agnolottis are like raviolis, but are half-mooned shaped. It's a vegetarian mushroom pasta dish and I would recommend it to anyone who loves mushrooms as much as I do.

We were afraid that we ordered too much so we skipped the Italian wedding soup. However, the nice waiter gave us something similar for free, and it tastes awesome.

We ordered the charity bread for share, I think it's a must try. The garlic and oil on the bread made it so good, and the surface is crispy. We also shared the caprese salad, and it was ok. The tomato is a little different from the tomato we usually take.

The pasta I ordered is the Pesto Pollo. It is a nice try with fettucine. Unlike spaghetti, it's wider. I think I maybe prefer spaghetti more. The whole pasta dish tastes good. I like the way that the cheese is scrap from a bar of fresh cheese, instead of Parmesan cheese in a jar.

"I love apiecalypse. I loved them before I even ate anything from there store. Why?Because I love that they are 100% vegan and promote veganism in a way that isn't about flowers, butterflies, and rainbows. I love that when entering their store you already feel a different vibe than most other vegan places, they have an activist edge to them and it's awesome (I love my sticker that I got from there once that said ""you want to hear a joke? ""paleo"" best thing ever). 
Now onto the food, I love that they don't really care about it being 100% healthy, because being a vegan or eating vegan alternatives doesn't always have to be about health. This is a great place if you are looking for something indulging and amazing. 
Their ""mac & charlie"" pizza is by far the most amazing pizza they have and i am hooked. i have tried their slices (which are also very good) but that Mac and cheese always keeps calling me back.

"Practically came here on a whim and decided to give it a whirl. Ended up ordering a platter containing sashimi pieces of salmon, white tuna, otoro albacore, jack mackerel, surf clam, toro (fatty tuna belly), as well as purple-rice sushi and interestingly enough, vermicelli-wrapped sushi which I never see at other places that I venture to. The vermicelli-wrapped sushi had a nice crunch to it and had a blanketed drizzle of spicy mayo as a nice added touch so I thoroughly enjoyed this meal. The entire platter was about $36 and does not come with miso soup, so be prepared to have that as an added charge.

The ambiance was fairly quiet as my guest and I were one of the only other customers here, however as we were enjoying our meal, there were plenty others who came in to pick up for take-out. The vicinity in itself is fairly small considering it sits on a block meshed with other small restaurants and towards the end of the meal, music started playing in the background so that was kind of an odd ending to the night, but at least there was a TV playing some CP24 in the background to drown out the stillness of the chatter.

This was an absolute disappointment for Thanksgiving and I would much rather have done it anywhere else such as Andrei's in Monte Carlo. If you want to be disappointed go here.

"I like the food at Denny's more than meals served at pricier restaurants. My favorite is the Bourbon Chicken Skillet. Even though it isn't advertised as being gluten-free, it doesn't have any ingredients containing wheat- just chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in a yummy Jack Daniels sauce. Both Eat n Park and Max and Erma's have gone downhill in the past few years, but the food at Denny's has gotten better.",0.0

Every person at the table needed boxes. The prices are very very reasonable ours under $30 ea. Will definitely be back, already told some friends & planing a group outing there. If I had one small complaint it would be that the shrimp appetizer got cooked last and I was to full by then, I would have liked it to hit the plate as an appetizer more at the start of the meal, like with the mountain of fried rice I got.

"We ordered Fried Chicken with sweet and hot Sauce (yangnyeom chicken), Blazing Fire Chicken with Sausage, Fried Chicken with Green Onion, and Egg Soup. The yangnyeom chicken had a crispy batter on the outside and moist meat on the inside. The flavour of the sauce was a mix between a sweet and savory taste with a kick of spice, the perfect combination. The Blazing Fire Chicken was cooked with a hot marinade that was very spicy. But even though it was hot, it tasted delicious and the sausages really helped balance out the spiciness. The Fried Chicken with Green onion is a great choice for those looking for a non-spicy dish. The green onion salad had a sesame oil dressing which went really well with the chicken. And the Egg Soup was very delicious and helped to cut the greasiness of all the fried food.",0.0

"First off - good burger & the BEST fries (smashfries.)

We stood in line for a very long time.  It took 5 minutes before the first person in line moved through.  I was hoping she was just a difficult customer, but the next person took even longer.  The one and only gal working the register was making the shakes - so that was a real problem.  Meanwhile, the person running food was just standing there - she couldn't have run over and helped? One employee was walking around - not sure what he was even doing because the tables were all dirty.  I got a napkin and cleaned off a table for myself.  Seems like they could have used their people better.  And the guy in the kitchen yelled something - not sure what it was, but sounded angry.  All the employees were not very friendly - until we were leaving.

In retrospect that is a lot of alcohol in a very short period of time. Lord don't listen to me  maybe you shouldn't get open bar lol. Bartender was fun and made decent mixes for being on a Ferris wheel. Just tell him what u like. To bad I don't remember his name.

Don't worry about height fears or anything like that. You literally don't even know you are moving. No rocking or anything like that.

I usually get a younger lady (early 20's) and someone who I'm guessing is her mum. I usually get the spice on the side and I would sometimes get charged for it and sometimes I get it for free.

"At 5 pm today I went to the Oakville location for my first (and last) ever Zoup experience. I am feeling a little under the weather, so I thought a nice bowl of soup would be the best thing. When I arrived, the unenthusiastic teenager they had working the Frontline offered to let me taste test any of their soups before purchasing. On my second spoonful (testing the butternut squash soup) I had to immediately spit back up the soup ad it SCALDED my lips and tongue- I cried out in pain and tears filled my eyes. I informed the employee that the soup was far too hot to serve, he turned to his Co worker and asked if the soups had been checked for temperature yet today...to which she replied ""I don't know."" When  this employee went to check the temperature of the soup I had just been given, he said ""oh, it's 171 degrees F"" Ummmmmm are you people trying to take my skin off? Are you asking for a lawsuit? And after all that, I was offered a lazy ""uh...sorry?"" And only after I reiterated to the staff how badly I was hurt. I wanted to purchase soup so I joked that maybe I should wait an hour for the soup to be cool and for my tongue to heal, then when I went to pay my debit card was giving trouble going through. I got frustrated and left. They could have at least offered the soup to me for free considering the quite literal pain and suffering they put me through. 171 degrees. Unbelievable. You need to train your staff properly before someone gets seriously hurt! 
Oh and by the way, it is 2 and a half hours later and I still can't enjoy my own dinner before my mouth feels like it had 3rd degree burns in it. Seriously, I can feel shreds of loose skin in my mouth.

The meeting rooms and patio are clean and inviting. The patio fireplace is a great spot for conversing with colleagues between sessions on cooler mornings. (If only it was a no-smoking zone.)

Would recommend for meetings and business travelers. Have had some consultants stay at HGI and all reports are that it's a comfortable stay with easy access to things.",0.0
"It took over an hour to park. I called the hotel and said the lot was full, they said to park at another hotel. The hallways are full of loud drunk idiots at 2am. The elevators are messed up. Who's running this place? I'd save your money and go somewhere else.",0.0

Very busy but has buzzer so you can walk around in vicinity while waiting.",0.0

"Been here once while visiting Las Vegas. A great concept, that I hope they bring to New York. The food was great. They have a skinny side (healthy) of the menu and a fat side. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars is that they don't have a calorie listing, so you really don't know how healthy, the healthy side is.",0.0

I love everything five guys !! Yes it's a new location but I'm so glad they opened up. My new favorite burger spot for lunch. Been here twice and the food is good. Little burger fries and drink. Of course expect to pay $12-$16 for lunch. But you get what you pay for ... Deliciousness !! I still need to try their milkshakes. But will definitely be back. I wish they would be a little faster but I think they are typical time for a five guys location.,0.0

"This review is for the cigar lounge which is located upstairs.  It is a small room and it has one of the more impressive scotch selections on the Strip.  The service is friendly and exceptional.  Being an individual who smokes and enjoys 3-5 cigars daily and I've patronized many cigar shops and lounges, I really enjoy the small private feeling environment and atmosphere of this place.  The cigar selection is minimal so I recommend you bringing your own as you may not find what your palate desires.  I'd frequent here more often for a cigar, however, mobile connection is sporadic at best in case you need to be connected or need to do some work\/business over a cigar.",0.0
Used to love shopping here and tend to find good items however the customer service is always lacking and the attitude on returns is very unnecessary. Their policy isn't realistic and to be upset and exude attitude over having to look up a receipt is beyond ridiculous.  The manager is the worse here. Might be worth driving to other locations or shopping at other retailers at this point.,0.0
"In town for spring training and decided to try this place out. We took our food to go because we had to get back to the hotel.

Things that were good:

Customer Service - the bartender that took our order was very helpful in answering the questions we had about menu items. 

Things that were bad:

The wings - they were very typical wings. The wings themselves were ok. There was very little seasoning on them. We got an order of buffalo ranch boneless. The ranch flavor that I could taste was from the ranch dressing I dipped them in. The order of chili pepper hot was hot whenever I ate a piece that actually had sauce on it. The order of ancho chili lime were the same as the buffalo ranch. 

The name - I don't get it. I haven't looked in to their story, but they had a Cubs, Cardinals, Bears, Packers, and Yankee sign on the wall. There was a picture of NYC on the wall to and we think there's a New York connection to the name. 

Overall I would have rather gone to the national wing chain restaurant even though I really hate that place.",0.0

"Unfortunately, this place delivered what I can only explain as a bizarre checkout experience...The person ahead of me had many items but apparently not the cash to purchase them (except one). So I was drawn into some weird register malfunction explanation which I did not care to be a part of. 
Suffice it to say, I did have the cash to purchase my 10 items and was able to be rung up without further malfunction.

"I decided to pay Mother's Dumplings a visit just to see what the hype was all about. My overall take on MD? Meh. It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was. 

You definitely get that welcoming ambiance from the restaurant - the red walls, the fairy lights and framed pictures definitely made patrons feel ""at home"" at MD. 

Service was really slow. I had to wait for about 10 minutes to get seated and my waiter took ages to come back to check on me after I ordered my food. I will give the restaurant some slack here though - since all the dumplings and baos - from the skin to the filling was homemade, it makes sense that it took a while to get our food. I just wish that the servers themselves were a little more attentive to the patrons - at the very least, they could have let us know how long the food is going to take to arrive at our tables. Overall, in terms of service, the staff were friendly albeit a bit inattentive. 

I ordered the soup dumplings, Northern style wonton soup and vegetarian buns. I was hoping that the food would live up to their prices...not exactly the case here. The food was average at best. I was underwhelmed by the quality of the soup dumplings. The pork filling could have been juicier. The skin could have been thinner. There was barely any soup in the soup dumplings. The Northern style wonton soup was slightly better in comparison to the soup dumplings. The broth wasn't as greasy as most broths that are served in Northern Chinese restaurants, which was a plus. I also enjoyed the gingery flavour of the broth. The vegetarian buns were good but they weren't anything special. 

Overall, some of their food items were better than others. There are definitely better Northern Chinese restaurants out there.",0.0

"Wow. Very shocked at how good this place is. Went in on a Sunday afternoon starving! The place is a little small and surprisingly hard to find, but signs posted en route made it much easier. The decor is minimal and very American Country, it felt cozy. I ordered chicken fried chicken and my boyfriend got an omelette. The staff was completely on their game. My drink was never empty and the minute I pushed my salad plate aside it was picked up. The food was just perfect. I felt like I was eating at someone's southern grandmothers house. It was fresh and homemade tasting. I know that sounds odd but it's true. Like they made everything from scratch the minute I ordered it, no frozen or cheap leftover flavor that most restaurants have. You must try this place!",0.0

Didn't deliver what they promised.  Booked appt. for winter tire installation ... this happened twice... and the tires weren't there.  When tires were put on they were installed incorrectly.

No apology, no alternative options, no discount.  Blamed supplier and my car. Got home, grilled cheese under the hood.  Nice one guys, nice one.

First time at this Brazilian AYCE BBQ.  Overall would say it is average.  Decent selection of meats and ok quality.  Some of the steak choices were a bit overdone and not that tender.  Price wise not sure it would be worth the full price cost of over $70 (including the peel and eat shrimp) but we had a half off coupon.  I probably wouldnt choose to eat here for brazilian BBQ.  Not nearly as good as mainstays such as Texas de Brazil or Fogo de Chao.,0.0

"My first Habs hockey game experience. It was a great venue. Easily accessible walking from many hotels right in the area. Tons of local bars and pubs right nearby. The entrance and security was quick and efficient. The lower bowl seats, which somewhat compact, are without ant sightline issues or obstructions. It looks like there isn't a bad seat in the house. Jumbotron, sound, and lighting make sure the fan experience a great one. The concourse traffic wasn't bad, while bathrooms are a bit limited. Overall a great place to watch a hockey game....

"- Fantastic food presentation
- Excellent service
- Decor is severely lacking

For some reason, the decor of this establishment betrays the quality of food which it serves. The food was well decorated with very generous portions of greens and fruits. I feel very guilty for unwrapping the chef's intricate work! All this great food is in steep contrast with the decor however. The lighting are all spot lights but it does not reach the food giving them a very blend and stale look. The menu is printed black and white on cheap 8.5x11 paper which also doubles as a table mat. Washroom's are clean, I think, but there was a lot noise coming from the uncovered ceiling light. Oh yeah, one piece of cloth separates the dish washing area with the washroom entrances.

"We visited here during a recent weekend to celebrate my brother's 30th birthday.  As we had planned poorly and did not make reservations, it was excellent that this restaurant had a high table available in the bar area for immediate seating.

Drinks - most of us went with Old Fashioned (various bourbons) and service was prompt and correct every time.

Food - most of us ate pretty light as it was our first night in Vegas, but there were a few notable items:
1.  The bread selection was amazing!  The different selections and butter\/oil to pair was great.
2.  The duck fois gras was amazing!  Great taste while not overpowering everything else.   

Our experience was great, but the billing (covering for my brother on his birthday) caused quite the confusion when billing everything out.

I arrived here as one of six people, so seating was a bit tight as it isn't exactly a large establishment. However, it all worked out and, thankfully, the waitresses were on the ball, quickly taking away our used plates and utensils as new things were brought forth.

Their food is wonderful, definitely one of the top three, in my experience, Thai-based restaurants of both Phoenix and the Las Vegas area. I am personally a big fan of their Rama, and their Crab Rangoons are some of the best I've ever had. 

Naga has definitely become a family favorite ours and we look forward to coming back again and again!",0.0
Alex and Arthur are great!  They are friendly but most important they give a darn good haircut!  Enough said.  They are excellent and worth the wait!!,0.0
I'm giving it 4 stars because i'm not sure they disinfect their tools between customers. The rest however was great. I loved the manicure and pedicure (and i'm picky). We were seen immediately and got bottled water. The staff is very nice and welcoming. I was talking to them and laughing the whole time. They also use disposable liners for the pedicure. Will come back!,0.0
Not impressed! Food was ok but I rated it low because for the price its nothing special. If you want a side of fries with your burger its $8.00 extra. The burgers are $15.00.  You could get a burger as good or better at Applebee's.,0.0
"If this place wasn't down town and easier to get to I would go there everyday!!!

I love their food fun and creative all around great place to meet friends and have a great ole time. Hands down one of my favorite DTV joints. A must go....on and their Chicken and waffle yum their Mac and cheese Sammy poppin everything else also very satisfying.

Their House beer St. Bernarus Apt 12 is one of my favorites! It is great that it is always on tap! Mussels and Frites are best in town. Overall great environment. Long wait on weekend evenings sometimes but it is worth it. Otherwise there is ample bar area to sit and have a beer and relax before your table it ready. Seasonal menus too!,0.0
First time trying this place and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not vegan but I like trying new places and a friend suggested this place. I had the Drunken Mongolian with monk beef and it was full of flavor and the portion was perfect. Also had their strawberry shake which was delicious and a great way to end my meal. It doesn't hurt that the staff was very friendly and helpful in making suggestions. It's not very close to where I live but I'm sure I'll make it back there.,0.0

I ordered the Tonkotsu -- which was amazing! The flavors meld into this wonderfully warm dish. The pork belly was delicious! The weather was super damp and cold, so this was even better! I also had the Warm Apple Sake, totally delicious!

I'm sad to say I didn't have any soft serve ice cream, but can't wait to try it next time. I also saw tea pots, which leads me to believe they will have hot tea soon!

"We went there today. Had to wait about a half hour to be sat. (no biggie) Once we were sat, I noticed a couple next to us also with menus.  They ordered about 5 minutes before us.  They had eaten and left before we even got our food. There was also a party sat a half hour after us, and while we were STILL waiting for our order, the manager went to THEIR table and said their food would be out shortly. Meanwhile, we are STILL WAITING! No table touch at our table, which was disappointing. Felt like chopped liver. The food was ok once we got it. Not steaming hot or anything, but fine. I didn't care at all for the hashbrowns. I like mine flat and crispy. I was also disapointed that there is a 3.50 upcharge to change out the toast to a pancake. Totally not worth it. 

The server was sweet, but we would have liked an update on why our food took waaaaaay toooo long. 
I will probably go again as they had some really interesting things on the menu that I want to try. But in no hurry to go back.",0.0
"$85 after tax and tip for two appetizers, two mains, two desserts, and a beer. We were stuffed. 


APPETIZER: Brussels Sprouts ($7)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Smoked Cheese Sauce, Parmesan, toasted mustard seed. Pretty tasty. A little cheesy, a little salty. 

APPETIZER: Buffalo Cauliflower ($8)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Beer battered cauliflower, buffalo hot sauce, ranch dressing. SO GOOD. Standout out of all the dishes. Unfortunately, looking at other Yelpers' pictures, it seems like either it's not regulated or they've shrunk the portion, but we got maybe 10 pieces. It didn't really fill the plate, but other Yelpers' pictures look like they're about to overflow. Delicious nonetheless.

MAIN: Chicken & Waffles ($16)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Crispy chicken, sour cream, spicy maple, green onion, sourdough waffles. A waffle sliced diagonally sandwiching three pieces of boneless fried chicken. The syrup was great. Not too spicy or overpowering. The sour cream was an interesting addition. Can't say it added much, but I like sour cream. The chicken was crispy and could've been a tad juicier, but it was delicious nonetheless.

MAIN: Home of the Brave Burger ($13)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
House ground ribeye, HOTB pickle mayo, House American cheese, Tomato, Lettuce. I don't like pickles or pickled things, but I didn't taste anything overpowering. The burger was just delicious. I don't like when burgers don't come with any sides. I don't consider it a complete main course and a bit of a money-grab, but the burger was good though. 

There are actually more desserts than are shown on their website's menu. We had these two:

DESSERT: Fluffer Nutter ($6)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Twist, peanut butter sauce, marshmallow coated ruffles, peanuts, white & milk chocolate. Lots of peanuts. That's the predominant flavour with this ice cream cone. The first few bites were like peanuts, peanuts, chocolate, and more peanuts. They give you a dish so that you can lay it sideways and eat it with spoons because I bet it'd get messy otherwise. The ruffles aren't that prominent, but the chunks that you do find are delicious. 

DESSERT: Red Velvet Funnel Cake ($8)
--------------------------------------------------­­---------------------
Red velvet batter, fresh berries, cream cheese icing, sweet Jesus vanilla soft serve. Way too sweet and I usually like sweet stuff like white chocolate. Maybe they've improved the batter because despite other reviews, the funnel cake was not hard at all. It wasn't fully crispy either. I guess it was a comfortable middle. The cream cheese icing is overkill. With the ice cream, the dish is already sweet. The icing makes the dish unbearably sweet. Everything else was pretty good. 

I was satisfied with every dish with the exception of the icing on the funnel cake. The portions weren't huge (despite our server's warning), but I think you could comfortably share an appetizer with someone, have your own main, possibly skip the dessert, and be satisfied. We ordered everything just cause we wanted to try it all. 

Aside from the obvious choice of fried chicken and waffles, the buffalo cauliflower was a clear standout. Would definitely recommend that one.",0.0

"Came here for brunch on a Sunday, it was quite busy but we don't mind waiting. Things started off well, we were steated quickly and we recieved our coffees quickly as well. However it took an hour to recieve our food, not one person came over to explain the wait or ask if we needed a refill on our coffee or water which were empty for 45 minutes. I understand the kitchen can get backed up and waits do happen, but you should explain this to your guests. We finally got our food which was alright, I ordered the eggs benedict and there was barely any hollandaise sauce and my poached eggs were overcooked. When it came to pay the bill we left a 10% tip, as we thought that was fair for the service we recieved. The waiter came over to us and told us off because its expected you leave at least a 15% tip. This was outrageous to me, he was at our table for maybe 2 minutes, never asked how our food was or offer us more drinks and he is questioning why he didn't get a 15% tip. Tips are earned, and when we get great service we leave a great tip. Don't mouth us off for 'bad tipping' when you ignored us for most of the meal.",0.0

"I liked this theater. Had a date night here this past weekend, it was my first time visiting, not his. I thought the actual ticket cost would be higher, but they were 10 bucks a piece. I liked that when I booked online, I reserved the actual seats I wanted, opposed to other theaters where you sit where there is room. Parking is kind of a nightmare, its in a garage, and there are stairs required (at least this weekend the elevator was broken)....just a warning, as of course I wore heels. The seats were nice and oversized, comfortable! We sat in the very back row on the corner seats, great seats. I think any of the higher seats would have been good though. After reviewing the menu I decided to not get any food or drinks, I though they were overpriced (I am cheap though lol).

"This was a great choice.  We were looking for a good steakhouse and found it here.  To start, we got seated right at the window looking north up the strip, and we could see the Wynn and Encore across the street.  It might have been romantic, if I wasn't dining with a couple other guys...

The ambiance was nice - like a quiet version of Fleming's with a touch of the Rat Pack.  Paintings of notable faces from the old days of Vegas hung on the walls in various corners of the restaurant.  Speaking of Fleming's, the menu resembled theirs in format and pricing.  The service was exceptional - very attentive, but not overbearing.

I got the lamb chops, which were outstanding!  I ordered med-rare, and they came very pink and warm - perfect!  They served it with a cherry compote, which was a perfect compliment - I'm not a fan of the mint jelly that often accompanies lamb.  One of my friends ordered the Delmonico steak, which is a 22 oz bone-in ribeye.  All of their beef is dry-aged in-house.  As good as my lamb was, I was coveting that steak, and he said it was great.

"This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed at! First off we were supposed to stay in the Manor motor lodge with a king size bed. Upon check in they put us in a double queen( and we'tea couple, I hate that). Check in line absolutely too long whenever we called downstairs the the front desk NO ONE ANSWERS! And we were stuck here 5days. Entering the room the carpet was wet like it had just been shampooed literally.We could never get a hold of housekeeping and the tub was dirty. If ur planning an adult trip u definitely don't want to be here too many kids running all over the place. We ate from the Westside deli and I had hair in my corned beef. I really never experienced such poor customer service! My girlfriend say she was bit by a bedbug , didn't physically see any but the sheets did feel itchy. The hotel smells horrible like cigarette smokes embedded in the carpet and walls! The main lobby is at the back of the hotel and Getting to the strip is such a hassle whoever designed this hotel was a horrible architect.The only nice thing I can say is they held our luggage for us on the last day because we had an overnight flight( but what hotel doesnt do that).

"Came here for their afternoon tea\/lunch special. They seem to have a wide variety of foods from HK style breakfast to AYCE kbbq\/hot pot. However, for their extensive menu, they definitely need to invest in more waiters. There were only 2 waiters in the entire store at lunch time. When we tried to call them because our food was finished and our drinks haven't arrived yet, they pretended not to see us and acted busy. Funny thing is, when we were about to pay for the bill and had money on the table, they ran and attended to us right away. So they are quick in collecting money but terrible in catering to other needs. 

Anyways, for the food, we ordered a Maggi salmon rice dish (6.99) and all day breakfast Satay beef rice noodle with egg sandwich and lemon tea (7.99). Keep in mind, if you want soup\/ drinks, everything is extra and not included in the already expensive price. I thought the all day breakfast was pricey for something so simple and the noodles came in a pretty tiny bowl. Egg sandwich was bland and flavourless. Salmon rice dish had only 4 pcs of fish, and small kimchi at the side. Nothing special for the pricey dish. However, I gotta give it that the place was modern, but I guess that's what you pay for and not the food itself. If you're looking for value, this is not the place to be.

"Such an awesome place and the service was on point. I was a little disappointed to see that their menu was not more expansive but still found great items to eat.

We sat on the patio area of the restaurant and it was beautiful. The conversation was good, so we didn't realize that our food hadn't come out for an hour. Our waitress was very attentive and was actually the one that brought it up to attention. They came back up to us to apologize and bought another round of drinks for us. Awesome save Public School 702.",0.0
"IT WAS AMAZING!!! The service, the food, the atmosphere. Server offered me strawberry peach lemonade (house made) 10\/10.

"Where do I start? My love for Chipotle has been stronger than titanium is. Ever since I first took my bite into that juicy delicious burrito my life has been filled with happiness. I recently went to chipotle and ordered a burrito bowl with the heavenly chicken, black as night beans, brown rice that comes from the fields of dreams, along with amazing mild salsa, a touch of white cloud sour cream and the sweetest corn salsa, topped with the finely chopped green lettuce. I was in aw when I had this burrito bowl. Chipotle is not only cheap, but extremely filling. The portions could fill a hill giant. Thank you for always being there for me Chipotle. :)",0.0

"We noticed this place a block away as there were a bunch of people milling around the entrance and in a nice outdoor patio area. You could easily tell it was a neighborhood favorite. The guy who took our order was great, they were quick despite a lot of customers, and the coffee was great. There is a lot of seating inside and outside and rugby playing on a tv in the back corner. No frills inside and the wifi was out while we were there, but you could definitely spend some time there on a laptop. I would definitely come back again.",0.0
"I returned for my 5th time, I think, and had a nice salad and a protein shake.  Food and shakes have always been tasty and healthy here.  We sat outside, which was great, except for the dog who was with another customer.  The dog was on a leash but not a short one and they allowed the dog to sniff around, wondering freely and toward our table.  I mentioned this to cashier when we went back in for the shake, and was taken a back when they rudely, in my opinion, said, ""that is not our problem.""  Perhaps they were correct, but it would have been better to tell me something more comforting or reassuring.  Did not like the attitude.  I will probably remain inside next time.",0.0

"Nicole is fantastic!  I booked a Hands, Feet and Scalp massage with her, but as soon as I mentioned I had chronic jaw tension she created an entirely new regimen for the 45 mins I booked, which focused on all muscles affected by jaw pain.  The massage was wonderful, and she even taught me a few exercises that I could do on my own time to relieve any tension that might return.  As she said in her own words, ""the next time you come back it should be because you want to - not because you need to"" and I definitely plan on returning (although I don't have the excuse of jaw tension anymore!)

"This restaurant is in an unassuming strip mall across from Mt. Pleasant go station. Really nice interior, great for a date night. Pricing is quite reasonable, and they have a great lunch menu too.

Don't order the crab fried rice - it has shells in it.  The chicken and tofu fried rice choices were fine though.

The won ton appetizer is very tasty and usually  not too oily.  My usual order is the chicken noodle soup, which usually has some nice pieces of chicken (though they seem to be using more ""scraggly"" cheaper and thus tougher cuts lately).  Be warned that different chefs\/cooks seem to have different ideas of what ""mild"" means.  Some will not spice it at all, while sometimes it will have a touch too little or just enough heat.  My solution is to ask for the spice tray.  I use the red chili powder mix in particular, but only add a little at a time or you'll add not heat than you want.  Blame it on being from Hawaii, but I also enjoy ordering a side of white rice and using that to supplement the noodles in the soup.

The bartender even took a few glances at us and he didn't even come by. We were very disappointed to not get any service at all! Now I know why there was hardly anyone in the restaurant.

Hubby had the G&B burger and I had the Salmon Burger at the recommendation of the waitress (was also considering the Bluegill BLT). Hubs liked his burger, although it was a bit messy. I REALLY liked the Salmon Burger. It comes topped with a slaw, cucumber slices and spicy aioli that were the perfect complement. There's also a slaw served on the side that is on the vinegar, rather than mayo, side of the flavor wheel. The level of vinegar was pretty much perfect for my tastes. Hubs and I also split a small basket of fries, which was plenty for the two of us. The fries were thin cut - just like I like them! - and a tad overcooked. But hey, I'd rather have an overcooked fry rather than an undercooked one. Portion sizes were good and we both had half of our burgers left over to take home. 

We ended out our meal with their dessert of the day - a simple almond cake with hand whipped cream. The cake was lightly dusted with powdered sugar and was absolutely delicious! Needless to say, there was no cake left over to take home.

The space is open and airy, although our table in the bar was a little overwhelmed with patrons waiting in the bar area for tables to open up. It's also a little noisy with the bar flowing right into the main dining area. There is a smaller, snuggly room at the rear of the main dining area, so I imagine if you can finagle your way into that room, you'll experience significantly less noise.

"I heard about Kinkaids Classic American Dining through the Phoenix Chamber, and I must say, by far the best restaurant I've ever been too.  They are not the cheapest, but between the food and atmosphere, it makes it perfect for that little get away for the night with your wife.  Me and my wife have dined here multiple times, and always are we just taken away by the staff:  Courteous, on top of things like refills, and patient.

By far our most memorable experience would have to be our anniversary dinner we had here.  The food was amazing, and the server was kind enough to allow us to enjoy our food and time together.  There was no rush to order, no rush to eat, and no rush to get out.  Very calm and relaxing.

I especially like the Live and Learn lunches hosted every Friday.  This is where you sit and learn something such as planning for retirement, how to organize your home, etc.  And all presentations are done by the professionals in their field with no push to buy their services.  It's just good advice for the DIY.

Some awesome food Highlights would have to be try their Mashed Potatoes and Chicken Parmesan.  Always a delicious treat.

There is a bar area for events and meetings, as well a little hang out for after work drinks.  And the main dining area is clean, private, and decorated nicely.

I don't know if I would bring little kids to this establishment unless they are well behaved.  There is no kid menu either to my knowledge.  It's too much of a ""grown up"" place for kids in my opinion.  But if you and your wife (or husband) are looking for a night out, stop here for dinner.",0.0

"I just took my parents to Nandos because I had gone to the location in Chandler and had great service and food. Unfortunately this was definitely not the case at this location. We ordered a cheese crisp as an appetizer, all of the food ended up coming out at the same time. We asked for them to take back the cheese crisp because it would have gotten cold. I am vegan and ordered a guacamole taco and black beans without cheese and my meal came out smothered in cheese. They did bring it back out quickly and the food was decent. I was told that through my work I get a discount and I received that discount when I went to the Chandler location. The manager came out and gave me a round about story about the programs they offer and that isn't one of them but she will check into it. The cheese crisp stayed on our table the entire time even though they said they would take it back. We still got charged for it and all of the employees we encountered had terrible customer service.

Also tried the jicama salad and kimchi fries. The baos were fantastic, the condiments and sauces accented perfectly. All portions were generous and priced fairly. I have to admit I was drawn to the meatball banh mi due to the peanut butter, however I could not detect the taste in the sandwich and was slightly disappointed. The duck confit sandwich was super, enough meat to balance the bread. The fries were tasty however a bit overkill considering the other items we ordered. Jicama salad was refreshing.

"I went here in the summer with my cousin who was visiting Toronto and really wanted to come here. With the line up being half an hour, I wouldn't have waited had it not been on her tourist wishlist. We waited and we're excited to see all of the flavours of ice cream and cookies. We planned to share so we got a Taro macaron sandwich with Taro ice cream (yup we're Asian and love our purple yams) and we got a cookie sandwich with cinnamon crunch ice cream. They looked glorious, esp the macaron sandwich. We left the crowded storefront and found a bench on Ossington. After a few cheesy photos, we dug in. After a few bites in silence, we slowly put out our verdict...hmmm...it's sweet...this is kinda messy to eat...hmm the ice cream is just ok, until we both realized we were on the same page --we really didn't like it, either of our choices. It was just humbling to admit that we hated something that we waited half an hour for, and was 'proud' to get after ordering, like we earned it or something. But no --the ice cream did not have that pure taste that homemade ice cream should, it didn't taste fresh, but rather gummy, it was overly sweet, and was just bad. The cookies also were not good. They were not hard cookies, but they weren't soft either. Nothing chewy or gooey or fresh-baked comfort vibes here. To bite into the sandwich, you have to bite hard enough that it forces the ice cream filling to slip and squeeze out. Pls understand, that my cousin and I love to eat, we love sweets, and especially love enjoying them together. But we were so turned off by how bad this was that we were offering the other to go ahead and finish it, meaning, we didn't even want to eat it and finish this ourselves. With immigrant parents, we of course, finished it, but only on principle, not because we wanted to. I will definitely not be back with so many other ice cream and cookie options that are much more superior around.",0.0

I've been to the restaurant once so far for lunch because many people were recommending the chicken waffles there.

After a horribly disappointing experience at other dealerships my boyfriend and I were about to give up. We stopped by Atlas and were greeted by Alan Painter. We explained our unique situation and right away he made us feel hopeful. We found a car we liked and took a test drive while Alan crunched numbers. After a denial from the first bank he assured us he would do whatever he could to get an approval. We headed home because it was so close to 5pm and we weren't sure we would hear back in time. A short time later we got a phone call from Alan and he got us a payment lower than what we expected as well as an interest rate we could only dream about. When we arrived back at the dealership our car was already set to go and the paperwork process only took 30mins. There was not one time that we felt pressured or belittled by Alan or the other staff. It was refreshing  to do business with a dealership and not have to deal with any games or shady business. Thanks again Alan!,0.0

My husband got a dish he hasn't had before and said it was okay, and the avocado egg rolls for appetizers are no where near the cheese cake factories avocado egg rolls (which are amazing).
The food was served luke warm as if it had been been sitting for a while before getting served and quickly went cold. The server was only extremely ""on"" and attentive, or ""off"" no-where to be found. 
The prices sure stayed the same - around $70 for 2 people but the quality of food isn't what it used to be sadly.

I frequent the Hard Rock Nobu. The sushi chefs are on point. Fresh fish.. excellent entrees.. and usually wonderful service. I visited alone Thursday night and sat at the sushi bar. The chef was wonderful and my server was very attentive. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience and therefore was happy to leave a wonderful tip. Friday night my boyfriend took me for a date night. Again we sat at the sushi bar.. same sushi chef.. different server. This chick was an idiot. We had to flag her down to get water... then again to order an entree. That was the last time we saw her the rest of the night.  We waited 30 minutes to pay when another server saw us and took care of it. If there was any of the tip that wasn't going to the sushi chef....we wouldn't have even bothered to leave one. I will still go back for sure. Just don't sit in a chick named Tueys section.,0.0

"Better than most pizza buffets you will find in the east valley. I loved the salad bar since it had a lot of choices, the pizza on the other hand was mediocre. The pizza guys didn't change the pizza out unless it got busy so we had to wait  for a fresh one to come out a few times. Besides that tables were all super dirty and it was super slow. We had to take a napkin to scrape the excess food left from the prior people. Overall a nice family environment pizza place.  My son would go nuts seeing so many pizza choices!",0.0

"Absolute worst customer service of any Journey's locations I've ever been, and being a converse family, we've been to our fair share of Journey stores.  I have been 2xs: today's trip (journey #2) will be our last.  We were kind of hoping the first horrible experience at this journeys was a fluke, due to back to school and the 4 teenagers getting a busy rush, as several customers walked in shortly after U.S., but sadly it was not.  What's even worse, the two girls in there today were not part of the first group of mismanaged misfits. 
Which is really disappointing since I love the San Tan Village and go there first for all my shopping needs.  However; I refuse to NOT shop at a store I love due to lack of training, poor customer service, and overall dissatisfing experience at one location, and will now go out of my way to get the quality service and experience happiness!

Today I had to go for an aspiration of a cyst with the possibility of a biopsy for a second round of cancer.  Carmell Hobbs took great care of me in getting me relaxed and prepared for what the doctor was going to be doing to me.  Dr. Saumil Kadakia continued to keep me relaxed and let me watch the monitor during the procedure.  I am one that does not like needles and Dr. Kadakia told be to be prepared for the injection of the numbing agent -- I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING!!.  It was really neat to watch the aspiration of the cyst (to include the needle actually going into the cyst) and then the collapse of the cyst itself.  The best of all was that I am still cancer free -- NO second round of chemo & radiation!!  I feel like dancing.,0.0

Everything we had was great: beet salad, bison sliders, deviled eggs, beef stroganoff, and scallops. We ended with the bacon jam and brie on toast, which was just fantastic, and sweet enough that it could roughly pass for dessert. The cocktails were also spot on. I would go back here in a heart beat.

The seating is sort of community-style: we were at a table that could seat about 10, so there were the 3 of us on the end, 2 folks to the right, and 4 more across the table\/to our left. We ended up just talking amongst ourselves, but I could see it being the kind of place where you could chat with the other folks around and it would be a lot of fun.",0.0
"My family went there for lunch today to celebrate my sibling's graduation with her fellow classmates. Everyone got the Hibachi lunch special. I got the clear soup which was fine. It wasn't supposed to anything special. My family got the salad with their meals but none of them enjoyed the salad dressing. It was pink, creamy and completely drowned the contents of the salad. 
As for the Hibachi meals, they were decent. The meats and veggies were cooked well. However, sections of my rice was chewy. If I had paid the dinner price I may had been upset but at lunch it only costs $10.

Jason greeted me quickly and I ordered a raspberry iced tea and a Marzen BBQ burger. It came with sauce, bacon and cheddar, plus garlic fries on the side. It came to $16.25 plus tip, which is high for a burger. 

My lunch arrived in 7-8 minutes. The fries were killer. Lots of garlic, some parsley and salt. Just perfect. The burger was very good, if a bit messy but burgers with BBQ sauce always are. It was also huge. The veggies were crisp, bun nicely toasted and cooked just like I asked-medium rare. After a few, Jason refilled my tea and offered me one to go as well - nice.

"Tried this place for the first time today and it wasn't a good experience. The restaurant was nice and atmosphere was good but the food... not so great. Food was cold, even the marinara was cold, and there were toothpicks inside my calzone! One of them stuck me in the roof of my mouth! I complained to the guy in charge (Jesus?) and he just said ""that's how we hold the calzone together."" Might want to warn people about that. I have eaten lots of calzones as an Italian growing up in New Jersey, never have I had toothpicks in a calzone or had it served with cold marinara sauce. Jesus didn't seem to care that I wasn't a happy customer. He just said sorry. Nothing more.

My wife actually asked to go back two more times just because it's one of the best, quickest, cheapest meals you'll find there at the heart of the strip.

I went to try the chicken wings here cause I heard they are good. I tried a dry spice for my wings. They ended up having hair on them. The wings are big but for taste I've had better.

I was pretty disappointed in our service. Our food was overall really good. We were in a group of 6 and ordered several small plates before dinner.the waiter had recommended the ravioli and spaghetti. I had ordered spaghetti one of their signature dishes and when the ravioli shows up I very politely told the waiter I didn't order this. He very quickly and adamantly told me I was wrong. I hate being that person so I didn't send it back and the waiter didn't even offer an apology. I feel like all restaurants should make an effort to right their wrong.

Went with the wife due to being a block away and heard so many great things about this place.  The restaurant was very classy in appearance.  The menu nice and simple which I prefer.  I ordered a sidecar and the wife a lemonade which were both amazing.  The food was very lackluster and reminded me of Dennys but 4 times the price.  I had the vogue steak which cam bland an unseasened.  The sauce needed more time to reduce and tasted bland as well.  The steak tasted as if it was frozen and not fresh.  The wife had the vogue burger which tasted much better then my steak but had too many things going on.  Everything got lost and it was terribly overwhelming and unenjoyable.  The table next to us seemed like regulars and order drinks with a cheese tray.  I think if we were to return we will follow suit and leave the food to someone else.,0.0

"If you're from the East Coast and you've eaten here then you know that this food stems from authentic eats you can find at your local Italian joint. It's a good fix for us when we want some chicken parm (my favorite) without all the mess in the kitchen because I usually make it myself. I love their food and the red sauce is perfect because it's not over seasoned and lets the tomatoes sing. We've never eaten inside because we live so close so we always get takeout.

My only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the sometimes the pasta tastes like tap water. It's something that we have noticed since we moved here and pasta's one of those things that you have to be careful with because it takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in. I would think a non-mineralized water would work so much better and improve the quality of the food greatly.

They did not have some of the dishes we wanted when we ordered which is a reflection of their exhaustive menu (too many dishes). It felt as if I was reading a short story. The dishes came quickly which was great cause we were starving! However, it took them forever to get us the bill and a take out box.

"These guys get a 5 star review. I came to vegas to celebrate my 21st with my sister and we had the best time we couldve had. They made my birthday very special. The party bus was so nice and played my favorite music. The promoters are very attentive, fun and professional. I couldnt thank them enough for such an awesome night. Thank you guys!  I would reccomend everyone to go through them for a fun time. Next time im in vegas in September im giving these guys a call!",0.0
"My fiance and I have eaten here many times and the food, drinks and atmosphere have never disappointed. It's one of my favourite places to take friends visiting the city because it combines delicious food with a fun, bustling atmosphere and amazing decor. Favourite dishes include the guac and pollo tinga (chicken) tacos. Reservations are a must on most nights - weekday or weekend.

The reason for my review today deals with a pretty terrible recent take-out experience. I placed the order over the phone and was told it would be a 30-45 minute wait. We arrived 45 minutes later and were given the wrong order. I noticed it immediately since the receipt didn't reflect what we ordered, and the staff apologized. We waited another 15 minutes or so before being given our food. When we got home with it, we realized one entree was missing (a burrito.) I called and the staff member immediately knew who I was, and since they don't deliver, we had to head back to the restaurant to get the rest of the order. 

When we returned, I thought we'd be handed the missing box and be on our way, but we waited another 20 minutes. I'm not clear on whether they remade the burrito or hadn't made it in the first place, but the extra wait was unfortunate. They threw in some churros for this inconvenience and also offered us drinks, which was nice even though we didn't accept. 

When we got back home the second time, we opened the burrito box to find three tacos - not what we ordered, even though the receipt correctly reflected what we ordered. Even though we decided not to return to the restaurant a third time, I called to discuss the situation with the manager and was offered a free dinner next time I'm in the restaurant.

This situation was handled by the staff very well, but it was still very unfortunate. We ordered the take out at 7:15 p.m. and weren't eating until 9:30 p.m. It was way too heavy a meal for that late at night and while the food was delicious, the experience left a bad taste in our mouths.

My advice to anyone picking up take out from this location would be to check the order before leaving. It may be awkward to open up the boxes one by one to check each item, but it may save you a lot of time in the end.",0.0
Been to this place a bunch of times and I have never been disappointed! They have the best tamales and their espos salsa is amazing! The staff is very friendly and I am glad they are still in business!,0.0
"Great place to go if you want a delicious burger. I suggest splitting the green chili fries with a friend to make sure you have room for a burger. The burger I got was the El Diablo because I love spicy food and I always add bacon (burger was a little cold this time around). Also get a milkshake because they are delicious.

Only thing I don't like is that you have to get fries to go with the burger and the price adds up quickly. Not a place to go if you want a cheap bite to eat.",0.0
"Most of the time when I come here it is for lunch. I have been to dinner once or twice. For the most part my review is based around my experiences for lunch. 

I have been coming here since around 2007 and never had one bad experience. It can get a little busy so getting there for a early or late lunch is better than right at lunch time. Staff has always been excellent and never had an issue with the kitchen messing up any food. 

I tend to enjoy the calzone of the day. They are always fresh and taste great if you like the goodies that are on the inside that day. The lasagna has always been great as well. The bread has always been good too. 

Long story short great food and great people at lunch and the few dinner experiences were great too!

Really great company!  The installation was very professional.  The materials are very high quality.  We could not be more please with this company and would recommend to anyone wanting outdoor lighting.   I would give them an A+,0.0
Very friendly and professional office.  The exam was very thorough and I also needed to order eye glasses.  They had an extensive selection and I received great assistance in selecting the frame shape and color that was appropriate for me.  It actually was a very fun experience.

"J Crimi Eyewear is definitely the best spot in town for tremendous service and chic eyewear. I have been buying my glasses from J Crimi since his store opened. I would not dare purchase glasses anywhere else.

"One of the best meals we've had in Vegas and we've been to Vegas almost 60 times. The kale Caesar salad was bonkers, I had the bbq sampler with a pbr, she had fish and chips.

We stopped for lunch and it was packed, we only had to wait for 10 minutes and were waited on the second we sat down.
We both ordered the blackened salmon taco.
This ""taco"" is more like a giant burrito and the price of fish that came on it was as big as the plate.
The toppings were fresh and very good.

"My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place out for a while now, having heard how great it was. Well. Our experience was not all that great. We came in around 10:30 on a Sunday morning. We were told the wait time was about 20-25 minutes, which was fine. 35 minutes later... we were seated and noticed a LOT of empty tables and we were left wondering why the wait time took so long if there were so many open tables. Whatever. So by this point it's 11:10 when we finally get situated and start looking over the menu. I wanted the egg scramble with sun dried tomato, basil, and goat cheese but wanted to add some avocado and mushroom. I asked our server if I could add those two items to my meal; apparently the chefs are ""unable to change the ingredients."" What?! Adding TWO things to my scramble was that much of an inconvenience? I've never heard of such a thing, and I eat out A LOT. She finally relented and made it happen but it was still odd. 35 minutes later we're still waiting for our food and I notice that two groups of people who got sat AFTER us were getting their food BEFORE us. As soon as I was about to ask where the heck our food was, long and behold it finally came. Side note: I asked for fruit on the side, which ended up being ONE piece of honeydew melon... um seriously? That's all the fruit on the side I get? My boyfriend didn't even ask for fruit on the side and he got the same exact thing. Overall, the food was okay at best. Wasn't anything super spectacular. Don't get me wrong, it was good. But not worth all that wait. Service was slow, they weren't very friendly, and the food was okay. That was the first time I went to Hash House A Go Go, and that'll be the last time as well.",0.0
"The visit was Ok, nothing special, but the business office and payment process, what a nitemare.

Then a processing fee for the collection plus the charge for it going to collection.  So will not be using this company again, unless absolutely necessary",0.0

I order from here all the time but I was let down in disappointment this last time.... Waited for over an hour because the guy who took the order didn't put the APT # in properly. Got the pizza and it was not the way I asked for it to be made. I was already frustrated enough that I didn't even bother calling. I've ordered from here multiple times within these last couple months. Both times were invalid orders. Such a disappointment...,0.0
What a great job they did on my car. After I cancelled last min and rescheduled for the same day the following morning. They were more than willing to accommodate me. My car looks better then when I got it from the dealer.   Thank you so much. No one will ever clean my care but you guys.,0.0

"Late dinner off of my diet (UGH!), but nonetheless we came for dinner while we were at the hospital across the street. I figured since I was venturing off of my diet that I'd go ahead and get a beer. Bianca helped us out. They had a DJ spinning some older rap joints and several TVs on playing games and ESPN coverage. There's an in-house bar and it seems as though they turn this pizza joint into a mini-club during later hours. While I was there I got the Pizza Blanco which came with white sauce, spinach, tomatoes and a white cheese. In addition to the pizza we got the Honey Hot wings and I washed it down with the rocky mountain freshness...Coors Light. Would have preferred a Kilt Lifter, but figured I'd at least keep it to a light beer. Had a good experience. Food was made fast and tasted great. I'd return here for sure to try out a different pie that they have and a different flavor of wings.",0.0

"I would give this place zero stars if I could. Taco Bell gets closer to authentic Mexican than this place! 

The first time I went, I ordered a chimichanga... what I got some kind of mutant burrito with what I would describe as a soupy marinara on top of it. I asked if maybe there had been some kind of mix up and had ended up with an obese enchilada by mistake, and the waitress just rolled her eyes and said ""you ordered a chimichanga. You got a chimichanga."" Then promptly she promptly hurried away.

Second trip I got roped into was worse. After parking two lots down (their lot is appallingly small), we walked in to put our name down for a table. This might be a good time to address how cramped the layout is... there is practically no space for waiting parties to sit, and eating in a booth is like picnicking in a capsule hotel. If there were a fire there during dinner hours, there's no chance you're getting out of there alive. Regardless, we were forced to wait in our cars (it was snowing) for a text notification for our table. After an hour and a half of waiting, we went elsewhere. The text, incidentally, never came.

Even their takeout service is pretty rotten... It took me a full 25 minutes to get the attention of a bartender on my final attempt to eat their food, and by that time my meal was cold. No burrito is worth that kind of hassle.

So full recap- horrible food, horrible service, cramped, dangerous layout, and even terrible bar staff. If someone were to bulldoze this restaurant tomorrow, I would have a parade in the bulldozer operator's honor. Zero stars.",0.0
"We order takeout here pretty regularly.  I love the staff - namely the tall gentleman at the checkout counter who never ceases to get a laugh out of me.  My only complaint with the staff is they make errors too frequently.  Most of the mistakes have been small and not a big deal, but we've had major errors where they forgot, for instance, three bags of chips, an order of tacos, and a salsa.  I can live with all that because the environment and staff are cool enough to outweigh their penchant for mistake making.  My bigger problem is with the Chipotle brand in general.  Copy Qdoba and introduce tortilla soup, QUESO DIP, and just more options in general.  We get so bored with all of the usual options and end up taking ""Chipotle breaks"".  All in all though, this location is wonderfully run, clean, cool, and a pleasure to visit.  Cheers, Rob",0.0
"Tiny location, but my biggest problem was the staff. They push their gift boxes as a great way to sample items and save money which is a blatant lie. I did the math on my 2 boxes and one I spent over 10$ more than if I had bought it separately and the other I spent 5$ more and this is on a 40$ box. So be aware you are paying 10-25% more for a pretty package and you might not like everything in it. Also I was shown wet sticky testers of conditioner bars and I picked one, got home and saw he had put the tester in my bag, ick. They also refuse to give samples of solid items at this location.

"I went into taco bell today Oct 28, 2015 between 2:30 and 3:00pm one by meadows mall.  I asked the cashier for two boxes of tacos with the cool ranch an mix tacos. Before I removed my food off the counter I told the manager who gave me my food and the cashier my order was wrong. Apparently they didn't care about customer service. So I want your Cooperate number because here at the taco bell you  service customers what you want, you didn't listen when I told  you the order was incorrect the tacos are not the same you telling me they are. A manager an the cashier customer service unprofessional. My incorrect order was $40 dollar's and some cents.

It's a shame I have went to Taco Bell today 10\/29\/2015 and spoke to the supervisor Miss Rita she was RUDE know better then the employee that was getting rid of me yesterday when I said my order was incorrect.

And Rita had a problem she had to stop and whisper something in another employee ear. Rita didn't apologize didn't try to fix the situation do everyone there have bad customer service?

"I made a huge mistake today. I ordered the tofu scramble from Sweet Melissa off of their weekend brunch menu. What a disappointment! Obviously the chef has no idea at all how to make tofu flavorful. All he\/she did for this dish  was cut it into chunks, deep fry it, put it in a sauté  pan LOADED with olive oil and a few veggies, salt and pepper and sauté them together for a minute. ( I am vegan so I asked for the cheese to be left off this dish)  I make Tofu scramble at home all the time.. I use at least 8 spices and herbs to give the main component of the dish (tofu) flavor..  (my stomach was upset all afternoon from the copious amount of oil too..) Now that I think of it they never flavor the tofu in the tofu Thai Fry either.. maybe Education is what the chef needs...

"My visit to Switch was disappointing.  Despite the fact that we had bottle service booked for a large party, we were made to wait outside in the pouring rain (there is no overhang or awning) for almost 15 minutes.  I could not figure out the reason for this, as who was let in at what time seemed arbitrary.  By the time we got in, my hair was ruined, and I was soaked to the skin and shivering.

The decor of the club is really cool, with lots of exposed brick.  However, the layout leaves much to be desired. The large number of bottle service areas made it difficult to move from one place to another.  There wasn't a lot of room for dancing, which is too bad because I was enjoying the music for the most part.

The washrooms are ridiculous.  The lineup was almost 10 minutes long for three miserable stalls.  

I will say that the hostess for our section was really nice, and made sure that we were well stocked.  However, after having to wait outside in the rain again for 5 minutes for re-entry after going outside for a cigarette, I decided that I was over it, and made it an early night.",0.0

Additionally, we weren't greeted by our waitress, we were approached with ""Are you ready to order?"" I felt that this was very rude and our presence was not appreciated nor acknowledged. We were never asked for a refill for our warm water either. If you are trying to show guests a great time and eat great food, don't go to Oggi's!!!",0.0

I get off work when they close so it would be nice if possible to stay open and hour more.

"Let me start by saying that I am like most people that write reviewa when a company fails to meet my expectations. Meise Design Group was not one of those companies. These guys were amazing in every aspect. They just finished my yard on Saturday and I couldn't be happier. Andrew took the time to bounce around with my schedule to meet with me to give me a great estimate. He was quick with responses and even got me the proposal back to me 3 days sooner than he had estimated. Andrew took the time to truely understand what my plans were for the backyard so that he knew exactly what him and his brothers were going to do. Edward even made the decision to have to work an extra day on my yard because the sod that was being installed wasn't up to MDG standards and made sure to get better quality grass. These brothers are very humble and respectful to you and your property while they are on it and it just shows in the work that they do. Both Ryan and Edward took the time to teach me things about the pavers, sod, and irrigation system that they were putting in. It meant so much to me to be educated about what was going in my back yard. MDG far exceeded my expectations for what my used to be bare back yard was, to now my ""get away"". It is nice to know that in the future I won't need to call 50 different companies or search for someone to do any of my landscaping needs, MDG has created a life-long customer.

"Not a bad place for a spontaneous pedicure.  It was the middle of the afternoon when I dropped in and the place was devoid of customers.  The place looked clean and my nail technician seemed pleasant enough.  My major gripe with the staff, though, is the fact they do not speak English very well.  (Nor do they contribute to an overall spa-like, calming environment with their smartphones dinging every minute.  Literally.).  Now, before you all get ready to jump down my throat, let me state a few things: 1) I am Asian, 2) I am an Asian who lives in a predominantly English speaking country, and 3) I speak English well (I do still get asked ""where are you FROM?"" after random strangers hear my impeccable English language skills).  

My nail tech hardly spoke any English.  She tried to ask me a few things and I simply could not understand her due to her thick accent.  From the context, I believed she wanted to know if I wanted a foot and leg massage for an extra $5.  I got tired of asking her to repeat herself, so I just said ""sure.""

Turned out that my context clues helped me to gauge her words correctly.  My total cost was $25 before tip (basic pedicure is $20).  My toes look pretty and I think the pedicure will last for a long time, given my nail tech's focused attention during the session.

"I randomly stopped in here with my family for lunch while in Vegas for a few days and have to say it was excellent.

"Was in Las Vegas for the weekend for the Rise Festival, had to try this place out before leaving. 

Came on a Saturday afternoon, found metered street parking easily.  We were seated promptly; the decor & ambiance was nice, calm, clean and casual.  The staff were all kind, especially our waitress, nothing beats a waitress that is knowledgeable and informative when asking questions about the menu. If you have an allergy let them know, they will kindly suggest replacing ingredients! Water was refilled constantly, thats a sign of great attentive customer service!

We ordered a couple dishes to try out, since we already have eaten before coming. The three   dishes we ordered were: ""Bao Wow""~ Asian BBQ tofu spinach mushroom in a bao bun. (which I didn't try, but my sister loves it!). ""Hot Tamale""~ organic masa, pumpkin green chilis and lentils (so good & not spicy! I love soft masa, well-made!). ""Muchos Gracias""~ organic sweet potato quesadilla black beans, chipotle crema (My favorite!! The flavor was unbelievable, and the ingredients went surprisingly well together!) restaurants should have this in SoCal. 

We waited a while for our food to come out, but the waitress did warn us the food takes time to prep. That means fresh quality food, done right!! So bummed that we didn't get to try the desserts here since we were so full.  Next time for sure!! Can't wait to be back and try all the other entrees!",0.0

"We live out-of-state and inherited a property that had not been maintained over the last year due to an illness.  We had been receiving HOA violation notices, so our Realtor suggested Jose from C&A Landscapes.  He was very quick to respond, get us a quote and even worked us in the next day when he had a cancellation.  He took pictures when complete so we could send to the HOA management company.  A few weeks later we had him come back and do the backyard before the house went on the market, including taking down a screened section of a porch which is not the usual landscaping job.  He did a fabulous job and looks great.  We would highly recommend him.",0.0

Came here with my wife during happy hour to celebrate closing on our house.  We really enjoyed it.  The tables and seats are dated and probably need to be replaced but we kind of like dive bars.  This really isn't a dive bar but the booths more adequately belong in one.  We got there a little after 5 and it was busy but still got a table (booth).  Parking is always a bit hairy down there but after circling the lot a few times a few spots opened up.  We had a bunch of oysters and were extremely happy.  I haven't had good oysters in AZ so I was very happy to taste freshness and get real horseradish to put on them.  We ordered a couple more apps and took full advantage of the happy hour $2 off apps.  We do like fried pickles but these ones are spears and we both prefer the fried pickle wheels.  The hummus was good and it had a kick to it which we like.  Really want to come back.

I've been here a few times, it's close to my work and I only get 30 minutes for lunch and they are always quick, but their sandwiches are the worst I've ever had. The bread is always hard to bite into (no joke, it's like biting into a piece of jerky) and it's loaded with barely any meat. There is a guy there, might be the owner, I don't know, seems like he just hates his job and his life and he's always a bit ... Off. I wouldn't say he's rude, he's just not friendly or pleasant. I'd never recommend this place to anyone I know.",0.0

After reading so many wonderful reviews on yelp, I decided to book an appointment with Nikki and I was SO glad I did. I got a wonderful haircut and even more beautiful balayage. Initially, I wanted to go for highlights, but Nikki recommended balayage because she wanted to make sure that my hair won't be damaged and will still look healthy and natural. The outcome was awesome, I was extremely satisfied with the result. I've been getting so many compliments since then. I paid $200 for the cut, style and balayage (might seem a bit pricey, but it was totally worth it). Make sure you bring cash, this way you'll get a better deal. I highly recommend this salon!",0.0

Now I realize Alan has very little to do with room availability, but he was so friendly and courteous that he really turned around what had begun as a bad day.  Every time we walked through the lobby he made sure our room was up to our expectations, he offered to help us find a cab to take to the airport the following morning, he suggested a place to eat where his referral earned us a free appetizer, and he was overall very pleasant.  Because of Alan, we joined the IHG club and will be staying with their hotels from here on out.  No more Hotels.com for us - that's how we ended up in a bind in the first place.",0.0

Two weeks later and it still looks almost new, very little chipping on the ends of a few nails, and very minimal hangnail\/cuticle action. Oftentimes a nail tech will clip off all the gross weird hangnails, cuticles, etc and within a few days it all starts growing back and you look like you've rubbed the back of your nails across a brick wall.

"Was informed by my u pod movers I hired that I needed to place a 24 hour notice to pick up my u pod box , so they notified me to call the u haul place in which it is being held at .


The older middle aged woman who answered my phone call 10 minutes prior to closing was extremely rude and smug , had me on hold for no reason for over 10 minutes . She intended to keep me on hold until they closed so that I couldn't have my 24 hour notice to have my u pod prepared .

"My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on Valentine's Day. From the moment we walked in, I sensed something was off. We were seated quickly as the restaurant was about 1\/3 full at 6pm. After a quick glance at the appetizer section of the one page V-day menu, we both knew we had to order the grilled octopus, $18. 

A long 20 minutes later, a very unimpressive plate of cut up ""grilled octopus"" was brought out before us. It was cold. The chefs excuse that was relayed to the server: ""it's supposed to be an octopus salad"". Nope. The menu said ""grilled octopus"", that's it. So she took it away and came back 5 minutes later with the same dish, but warmed up. It was rubbery, it was luke warm, and it was horrendous. We put it aside and didn't take another bite. 

At this point we had already ordered our main: the lobster and steak sampler platter for two. I was also sipping on a glass of wine while we waited and waited, and continued to be ignored by our server who didn't take the courtesy to come back and ask about our uneaten appetizer. About 40 minutes later and no sign of our meal, my boyfriend and I paid and left. 

We were terribly disappointed with this experience and now had the daunting task of finding somewhere to eat at 7:30 on Valentine's Day. Thankfully, we had a happy ending elsewhere.

I was walking on the strip with my family and needed a bite to eat. We were kind of in the mood for some authentic Mexican food so we went to Cobo Wabo. When we sat down our orders taken right away so the services pretty good. Me and my wife both ordered the Carne Asada. When it came to the table it looked like dog food. We thought it was just something they marinated it in. So we gave it a try but it was terrible it taste like dog food to. The management was nice but the food was terrible. And it wasn't just the state that was bad the chicken tenders for my kids were bad and my mother-in-law ordered pork. And it was disgusting.

A very discriminatory and hostile desk manager named ""Ivette"" talked down to us and completely was lying about availble rooms and was absolutely  unprofessional. I unfortunatly had lost my luggage and was still wearing my gym clothes - shorts and a tank - so she thought she treat us like garbage (and we were booking a high end suite). She belittled us in public and the hotel needs to  retrain its staff on proper customer service. They also need front desk staff that can understand and speak English.

Anyway when seated our waitress Jennifer tells me about the 50% of Sake bottles and i say we will think about it.  She comes and takes our order and again tries to sell us on the sake bottles where some bargains could be bottles that normally go for about 250 $ only is 125 $. We kindly decline since i dont like sake at all.  

We order 2 appetizers, another small dish to share and 3 mains. We ask Jennifer if the dishes are big as we had eaten a few hours earlier and she says that ""Its a good start"" and that we can order more afterwards.  

For the food:  

*Wagyu Sliders +2
We where informed by Jennifer that this little baby was cooked through since it was pork inside? Hmm why put pork in a slider with the expensive wagyu beef meat so you would have to cook it dry? What does people who dont eat pork out of religious reasons think about a beef slider that includes pork without it beeing mentioned in the menu? Anyway, the sliders where dry and tasteless and the taste of ginger was all we could find.  

*Sticky rice with spicy  tuna +3
Nice fresh tuna and the rice was ok on this signature dish though we couldnt call it spicy even if we tried. 

*Steamed lobster in broth +3
The lobster was cooked in a proper way and tasted ok but since we are from scandinavia we are used to exceptional seafood and this was more ""ok"".  The broth was tasty. 

*Wagyu Carpaccio +4
This was one of the best dishes where the gorgeous meat was the star. Thinly sliced and with lightly seasoned it was a hit dish.  

*Bass with szechuan sauce +4
By far the best dish of the evening. Superb cooked bass that well in pieces when touched. It had a crispy skin and an amazing szechuan sauce with a tangy nice kick.  Order this and thank me later!   

Our little Jennifer came by a third time to sell us some discount bottle Sake and asked if i really had tried it both hot and cold. I really dont like people who cant take a hint and her pushy ways was part of making this dinner one of the worst of our 6 days in Vegas.  I would rather eat on Fatburger or Dennys where the service is nice and with a smile. 

The price with 4 beers was a hefty 141 $ with tax but without tip.  
While the food was not bad but rather mediocre the price and Jennifer was what brought our experience down. And im not very sensitive to high prices as long as the quality of the  food is the same level. We had a +400 $ tasting menu at Alize a couple of days later that was worth every penny.

"I had breakfast there this morning and now I am laying in my bed at my hotel room sick as a dog.  I made the mistake of of ordering the Chicken Fried Bacon Biscuit. It looked good but one bite told a different story. To start, the biscuit had a horrible combination of herbs that just didn't make sense in a biscuit. The deep fried bacon, while it had a good breading, was severely undercooked with the fat no where near being rendered. The eggs had an off-flavor that I couldn't quite put my my finger on.

In retrospect, I should have gone with trusty breakfast items such as pancakes (a couple next to us had some and it looked great... the two gentlemen looked perfectly fine with their meal).

I dont even think they are real mechanics and the ego in the room was so big that there was no room for people!  They were acting like I was lucky to be in their presence as if I was a peasant and they were kings.  One of the guys, Sheenan, was the rudest and angriest mechanic I have ever met.  Very defensive and kept acting like I was bothering him by bringing my business here.  When discussing my bike to figure out what we needed to do he sounded as if he was just making stuff up.  I asked him a few technical questions and he seemed baffled and unknowing.  I do routine maintenance on my bike when I am home so I know quite a bit about motorcycles but this guy Sheenan new next to nothing.  Do not bring your bikes here.  They are hustlers not mechanics.

"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!!  The only good part of this experience was the drive home, agreeing not to come back here anymore!  We went in on a Saturday night, slightly expecting to have to wait to be seated.  But that wasn't the case!  In fact, it was so dead inside that they were closing all of the booths and cleaning up, only seating people right next to the bar.  Surprisingly though, the food took forever to come out.  It took 20 minutes for our nachos to come out, and you could tell they had run out of tomatoes and jalapenos, because they were fresh, like from the grocery store, while the rest of the toppings had obviously spent a week or two in the fridge.  Then, it took another 15 minutes for our wings to come out.  Not only were they over cooked, but the seasoning on them was scarce!  My lemon pepper wings didn't have enough seasoning to cover even 1\/3 of the amount of wings that were in the tray, let alone all of them!  And the Blue Moon BBQ sauce tastes like garbage, don't waste your time!  And the worst part of the night was the carrots and celery they gave me!!  It was brown and mushy, on the verge of being a moldy wonderland, but when brought to their attention, what do you think happened?!?  NOTHING!!  The waitress said she would tell the kitchen staff (like they cared in the first place), but instead went and flirted with another employee that was cleaning. She ignored us for the remainder of the visit.  We were not pleased, so she received the tip she deserved...  $0!!

"This Chipotle really is the worst I've ever been to in terms of sanitary hygiene. I came here about a month and a half ago and the woman serving was wiping her nose with her wrist (gloved hand, but at that point what difference does it make?) I stopped going to this one for a while because that seriously turned me off. I came back 2 days ago, seriously craving a ""Chipotle burrito."" My boyfriend found a hair in his food! NASTY!! That should have been the final warning for me. They handled it like any restaurant with poor customer service would, got him a new one. No refund, no free chips and guac, nothing to accommodate for that at all. Ok, so of course I'm craving Chipotle again today and as my bowl is being assembled the server decided to turn around and tap her buddy on the back with her, AGAIN, gloved hand and then once she got his attention, grabbed at the cheese and lettuce with the same hand!!!! I've had it with this place! I got home and threw the bowl out (I know silly of me to pay for it.) But I planned to call their corporate and let them know how unhygienic this place. To bad this is a franchise so I'm out of my $8. Seriously train and manage these people on how to better handle people's food because this place is gross!!!",0.0
"It can be hard to find food in Scottsdale late on a Sunday, especially in the off season.  OK, by ""find food"" I mean food that will please all, such as one can find at this new American meets char-grilled bourgeois chain with its massive menu.  So for me, this has been a kind of safety net for culinary dilemmas.  I've eaten the mac-n-cheese and other nom noms at the Austin location, and I've eaten at this location both for the ""burger\/bar"" experience and the full on dinner extravaganza.  Much of the food is way above average, and described in detail elsewhere.  On my last dinner trip, we had the scallops and the plank-grilled fish special.  Both were well executed, although I can't tell you anything specific about the flavor profiles.  That in itself says something for me.  Not that it's not good or not worth it, but that it's not ""special.""  I can still tell you what I ate at Citizen Public House a year ago, but not this meal from a month ago.  But the burgers are amazing.   And the lamb app is fun.  

I will say that as a dining experience this location feels like a cattle call, a kind of high-priced assembly line production with solid food, rushed service, and faux veneer on multiple levels. For me, this is the place to sit at the bar and get a burger and a glass of wine or beer in the afternoon, and perhaps an app.  As a dining experience, it's a bit cold an anonymous, not helped by the expansive interior.

The bar in Austin, just from a vibe level, is much more suited to my tastes.  And in Texas, at least the platinum-blonde dye is REAL.  :-0",0.0
"My wife and I were on vacation in Toronto and my wife found this place on Yelp and thought I would love it. She was SO RIGHT! It is a couple mile walk from the CN tower so you can work off the calories getting there.

You enter and the place is pretty expansive for a small 2nd floor establishment. Lots of long tables and my wife and I found a high table by the window. I ordered a kangaroo brat with sauerkraut and sauteed jalapenos.  I also got the IPA they recommended, (They have a great selection of beers on tap, probably 5 IPAs)

The clientele is a lot like Toronto, pretty young and kind of hipster like.

The food came about about 8 minutes later while I enjoyed my IPA and conversation. The kangaroo was very lean and the bun just wasn't a crummy white bun, this was a freshly baked roll and just added a ton to the meal. The spices were perfect for the bouncing marsupial. The toppings were done to perfection and every bite I reminded her how awesome she was for finding this place.

"I love this studio!  Two years ago a friend asked me to try a class and I never left.  Matt, the owner is very personable.  He's always up front to say hello and answer any questions you may have.

The other teachers are just as great.  They are friendly, fun and always know you by name.  

Each one hour session covers legs, abs, hips and arms.  It only took 10 sessions before I began to see all my muscles.  Today my body is completely toned and people often tell me how great I look!  When I tell people it's pilates they always look a little shocked.  I don't think people have any idea what a great workout it is.

Now, I have had successful donations and I have had unsuccessful donations.  At one point I had to take a 16 week break.  Things happen.  But reality is what it is.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out for one reason or another.  Back in the day if you had a failed attempt in one arm followed immediately by a failed stick in the other, they'd apologize and send you on your way with a bandage on both arms and no donation.  No need to be upset about it.  It happens.  It is simply fortunate that I can donate.  Many can't but I cant see getting upset about it.  For whatever reason it just wasn't time NH.

I didn't want to waste money on a cake that tasted terrible or looked average. Found Freed's through a reference and called them to order their ""Win Big"" Vegas style cake. I called Freed's on Monday to order the cake I needed for Friday. I spoke to Ella and she made me feel so confident in my decision to order from them. She was extremely helpful, fun and informative on the phone. She made me so happy to have ordered from them. I asked her which flavors were good and she gave me the best recommendations. I ordered an 8'inch chocolate cake with Raspberry puree filling. The cake was delivered (extra charge but so worth it if you don't have a car in Vegas and don't have time to run around) to the restaurant we were having the bday dinner at. I didn't have to worry about a single thing and Ella made me feel so relaxed because it was one less thing to stress about. My fiance and guests could not stop raving about how amazing the cake was. It is exactly what I had envisioned and the taste far exceeded my expectations. The cake was rich in flavor but not harsh on your tastebuds. I don't like sweets or desserts but a slice of this cake was delicious and the right amount of sweetness. The service was superb! Loved everything about my experience with Freed's.

Had a lobster (medium spicy), 1lbs of shrimp (fire spicy), corn, sausage, potatoes, cajun fries, and a bottle of Sapporo. 

Lobster was very moist, and perfectly cooked.

The shrimp was great with the lime and pepper they provide.

Fire is very spicy, even for spicy food lovers! It was almost unbearable at first, face numbing, but after a while we got accustomed to it and it was really good.

We got every thing Captains boil flavor, which is a mix of everything, similar to The Boiling Crabs ""The Whole Shabang""
Flavor was great.

Fries were crispy, kind of like KFC\/Taco Bell fries with Cajun spice sprinkled on top. They could have better distributed the cajun seasoning by tossing the fries.

On the menu when they say cob they actually mean half a cob, so at $2 half a cob it's a little pricey, but still worth trying.

$10 for a couple thin slices of sausage was too expensive in my opinion, probably won't get this again. Should be around $5 instead.

They did not have crawfish when I went. They should have a better system of telling people what is and what isn't available.

Stopped in to have a shake with my son. I ordered a snickers cheesecake shake - it was good but could have used a little more snickers in the shake. It tasted kind of like a vanilla shake with a few bits of snickers. Buuut I had no idea what to expect either so can't really complain I suppose. My son ordered a blueberry shake that was pretty good- not overpowering with blueberry (they use flavored syrup and no real blueberries). I would suggest offering a kids' size. It is a little bit of a wait so don't stop there if you're in a hurry. Facility was clean and inviting. Overall a decent experience. We will be back to try the food someday!,0.0

"This will be my first yelp review:

I visited the Las Vegas store and was pleasantly greeted and helped by a wonderful human being who gave me her feedback (unfortunately I do not remember the sales associate's name). 5 stars for her in store service.

I was told if these shoes do not fit (I was surprising my girlfriend) that I would be able to ship these shoes back and return them with free shipping (I live in Los Angeles), to which I agreed. The shoes did not fit, so now the return process begins (I should have known better)...

I contact the David Z website, I am told I can return the merchandise and I was also told I will need to pay the shipping cost, which I find completely unacceptable for the following reasons:

1.  I was told by in-store personnel I would be able to return free of charge before 30 days
2. The David Z web site states the following:
        a.  Once we have reviewed and approved your case we will send you a pre-paid shipping          
             label.
        b.  You can return your purchase for up to 30 days from the purchase date.
        c.  Product(s) must be in the condition you received them and in the original box and\/ or 
             packaging.
        d.  Return shipping is 100% FREE
        e.  If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase you can return your order for 
             free within 30days of your purchase date (Returns must be unworn, in the state you 
             received them, and in the original packaging).       
         f.  You will be provided with a pre-paid UPS or similar domestic label to return the 
              purchase to us.*


I attempted to contact the corporate representatives via email and via phone to further discuss this matter, to which I have heard no response back in either form of communication.

Pro-tip - ignoring a customer doesn't really solve the problem...go figure it only upsets them more? Interesting concept.

I later found the exact same shoes at Nordstrom for 40% off. I would highly recommend individuals stay away from this ill managed company that fluffs impressive claims but do not follow through. Competition is fierce and customer service is everything. I'd much rather do business with a larger competitor, than support a smaller business, when this smaller business has really nothing to offer other than uncompetitive pricing, false advertisement and poor corporate level customer service.

"I'm glad everyone else on this thread received ""great"" service because mine was absolutely TERRIBLE. 
i actually called to pre-request two reservations with this company. One was to pick me up and take me to my hotel and the other was for the following morning. 
I had THREE separate conversations\/phone calls regarding the times I wanted them to arrive just as a precaution.
The first reservation was to pick me up at 9:15pm. My hotel was literally an 8 minute drive from where I was. What time did the driver show up? 9:56pm; claiming he was lost. How are are you a driver for a living and you are lost?
THEN, I get in the car and he asks me where my hotel was. Was that NOT the whole point of taking notes of my reservation? WTH?!! 
He then turned on music that was very inappropriate for my ride; I was extremely uncomfortable and honestly almost requested to be let out; NOT TO MENTION, he had another man in the passenger seat; made me feel so safe...NOT.
We get to the hotel and he literally told me that my charge was $25. 

RIP-OFF. You were LATE... You were inconsiderate AND you ripped me off. I'm from NYC and I have received BETTER service there than with this company. I hope the owner reads this because maybe he should find better drivers if he wants to continue to have good reviews. I was far from impressed and will NEVER recommend this company again.",0.0

"Sunborn provided the flowers for our wedding in June 2015. I could not have been happier with the results. Carol did a beautiful job putting together all the bouquets and boutineers. I met with her in the dead of winter, and gave her a rough outline of our wedding theme\/colors. Her creations turned out better than anything I could have imagined. She was very organized, thorough, and easy to work with. We were also able to purchase buckets of cut flowers that we could arrange for centerpieces, which is a wonderful option for those on a budget! We got married at a location 2 hours from Madison, so we needed to pick up the flowers the Friday morning before our Saturday wedding. I was a little worried about how the flowers would hold up, but Carol reassured me and gave me instructions on where\/how to keep the flowers.

When our food finally came out 20 minutes later, our appetizer and entrees came together yet we continued to wait for our round of drinks. The empanadas were cold, tacos so soggy that they tore apart when we tried to lift them, and the taquitos were simply rolled fried tortillas that had no filling.

Every time I come to Vegas, I HAVE to stop here. I will literally stop eating dinner and drinks, that's how much I freaking love this place. . 

The value here is exquisite, the small is more than enough for someone as greedy as me who just doesn't share with anyone. I've attempted to eat the medium size and although I was super enthusiastic about killin' it, the portion sizes here are way more than you'd expect. I've seen couples share a small here, they pile the beautiful fluffy snow HIGH and the toppings are generous as well. I did finish the medium but I started struggling at the end and had to kind of rest, LOL. 

This isn't Hawaiian shave ice so don't expect that coming in. It's literally fluffy ice cream shaves! The flavors are all pretty milky, it's just a different sensation compared to eating ice cream from the grocery store. I've tried cantaloupe, black sesame and mango. I personally prefer the fruit flavors. The black sesame flavors could be a bit more prominent but it's actually pretty good as well. It's shaved on the spot, so it comes to you super cold and perfect! Toppings are 50 cents a piece, I usually get mocha or strawberries, I try to focus on the snow :) 

There are so many combinations, I think it's definitely a place for everyone even the pickiest people. There are pre-set choices or you could just build your own. Last time, I was able to have two flavors!!! They can only do this if you get a medium though, but YUM worth every penny. 

Seating is limited, you should definitely try to eat there if you can! It wasn't too busy the last few times we visited. We've also taken it to go and it was still in pretty good shape by the time we got to our hotel room. 

Parking could be a bit troublesome, it's in a shared plaza so I'd recommend just circling the parking lot if you can't find a spot, eventually someone will leave.

"Went here last night on a whim...was enroute to outback next door for a steak when my eyes gazed upon this establishment. Me and my queen were eyeing it as we rolled by and thought ""hmm, maybe they got steak"".... Walked in and was immediately impressed with the ambiance. The hostess was nicley dressed and friendly. The place is clean and lit perfectly. They have the sickest fresh water tank I think I have ever seen. Anyway, lets get on point. I am frugal not as in cheap. I want quality and I want to pay a fair price for it. I saw the prices and was impressed. I asked our waiter ""Alex"" what we should eat with the steak. He made a good recommendation. I had the steak and shrimp dinner... It came to my table and set off all my senses. I was actually salivating. I took that first bite and about orgasmed. I have never had a steak with such explosive flavor! I was almost moaning over my slab. Lol! I know it sounds sexual but it best describes the euphoric experience. If you want a steak that knocks your socks off cheddars is your place. They have something special and they know it.",0.0
"Took some friends from out of town here on a Sunday for dinner.  We all were impressed with the quality of the food and the service.  
The menu is tapas style, but their entrees are certainly enough for lunch or dinner.  What impressed us the most about this place was the attention to detail in the food.  Each dish had a perfect balance of flavors that made you want to savor each bite, and that is a rarity in most other  restaurants in this price range where quantity substitutes for quality.",0.0
"The food here is spectacular. It's traditional Italian meets savory & decadent. The service was outstanding and the decor is really elegant and beautiful. We were lucky enough to meet Chef Michael who is down to earth and passionate about his craft.

Appetizers - I highly recommend the crab cake arancini, and the caprese salad with special imported bufala mozzarella from Italy.

Pastas - My absolute favorite was the Burrata Agnolotti with lobster. The sweet bread in the gnocchi dish was surprisingly delicious and had a slight crunch; and the Ripatelli had a savory spice that's quite addicting.

Entrees- Osso Buco - hands down is a must have, ask for a crostini for the bone marrow! 

Dessert - the Nutella creme brulee is an obvious winner, and the cheesecake was divine as well!

This place is amazing. Gets super crowded during lunch but their rotisserie chicken is so good. And the fish yummm. We always get it at work on Fridays. The sides are also really good.

"My husband and I are always looking for comfortable and private spots for a getaway from the urban hustle-and-bustle of Chicago. We had seen photos of this cottage online in the past, and finally had an opportunity to get out of town! We were amazed that this one-of-a-kind, mid-century-modern cottage, (an architectural gem) was an available place to stay. We marveled at the natural stone and wood interior surrounded by a peaceful garden. The first room is comprised of a full kitchen (a refrigerator to stock with your favorite Wisconsin brews) and a dramatic hearth\/fireplace with a comfortable couch. Want music? An iPod\/sound system was well-stocked with music for all tastes--we enjoyed Miles Davis and John Coltrane--perfect to set the imagination free. A spot-lit gallery\/hallway displays local art and connects to another room with a cable TV\/DVD player and a full bath. I loved the soothing interior lighting. There were several outdoor spots to sit and relax. We appreciated the library of art and historical books. I was grateful for the free wifi, always a plus for travelers. The owners are friendly and helpful and recommended great places to visit nearby. We look forward to returning in the fall or winter!",0.0

I had no idea how huge and classy this place was, and not too dark like other steakhouses.

"I needed a new mattress, so I headed over because I saw a sign advertising a sale on queen sized mattresses. I'm on a budget, so this sounded like a great plan. I went in, and the salesperson was helpful and not at all pushy. I tried out the inexpensive model, and it felt pretty good in the store, so I bought it. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Delivery was scheduled for a window between 9 and noon a few days later.

When I bought the mattress, I was told that I had 100 days to try it out, and that if I didn't like it, I could return it and would get a refund, minus a $150 restocking fee. The delivery drivers came right at the beginning of the delivery window and were done in just a few minutes. They were polite and professional.

Unfortunately, mattresses aren't always as good in real life as they are in the mattress store. After a few weeks, I decided that I didn't really like the mattress. I went back to the store to arrange for a return. Since the mattress was really inexpensive to begin with, I would have only gotten a few dollars back after the restocking fee. The salesperson worked with me and was able to discount the restocking fee so that I still got back about half of what I paid.

The delivery drivers came the next morning, once again at the beginning of the pickup window, and hauled the mattress away.

Even though I ended up not liking the mattress, the entire process was hassle-free, and I feel that I was treated like a valued customer.",0.0

She took forever to come back to take our order, and when I asked if I could get mine without beans she angrily said ""we don't modify our tacos"". I asked if they were pre made and instead of answering she just repeated ""we don't modify our tacos."" Too cool to give the customers what they want, I guess. I get wanting to keep the chef's ideas intact, but at the cost of losing customers? That attitude alone, of the waitress and the restaurant is reason enough for me not to return.",0.0
"6 of us went Saturday just before 6pm, trying to beat the dinner crowd. We had attempted to eat here on 2 previous occasions, but didn't have time for a wait. They do have a nifty wait-list system that texts you your approximate wait time and how many others are in front of you. There was a line when we left.

We were very pleased. The restaurant is well decorated and our service from the time the hostess opened the door for us until they held the door open on the way out was efficient and friendly. Our waiter was attentive but not intrusive and the manager was making rounds talking to customers.

We ordered a Garlic Rotolis, a Lg. Pepperoni Classico, Sm. Capo and a Cheese Pizetta, plus a Caesar Salad. The pizza was really good, reminding me of ""John's of Times Square"" with a thin crust, crisp but with enough chew. The rotolis are fantastic and salad was a typical Caesar, but a good one.

Finally, if you like ranch dressing on your pizza or rotolis, they make a good ranch. Anyone from Albuquerque who understands the ranch from Dion's will appreciate this.

As for the price, yup, it is more expensive than the surrounding take-out\/delivery places, and worth it.

However, their shakes didn't taste overwhelmingly better than other custard shakes I've had. I still recommend people to try it and the food is good. It just didn't meet what I was expecting. Also, don't let the long lines fool you. They have fast service! My rating is more of a 3.5\/5.",0.0
"The atmosphere is really nice and the staff was friendly, also they have a pretty good selection of beer.  I'm giving them three stars for two major reasons:
1. Their beer prices are outrages for what they're offering. I get charging $12-$15 a pint for a small batch sour or specialty ale but these are standard beers that should never be sold that high for a pint. 
2. They closed at 11pm. My colleague and I arrived for their 10pm-??? Happy Hour (cause that's when they adjust to acceptable prices) and by 10:50pm the last call announcement was made. On the strip I just assume most bars stay open at least till midnight or 2am. It was unfortunate.",0.0

We first arrive  around 10 am and they let us check in without any fee. The staff is super nice and are quick to ask if you need assistance. They also helped my husband with flower arrangements to surprise me. The went that extra mile if giving us a bottle of apple cider since we do not drink. When we ordered room service it was quick, food was okay and if they saw the do not disturb sign they would have the front desk to call us because they didn't want to knock on our door.. 

I can say that we didn't go to Vegas at all even though it was only 5 to 10 minutes away. The concierge helped us plan our days, we enjoyed the trips to the Hoover Dam and hiking through the Lake Mead Recreational Center they have. There were so many things to do that we still were not able to finish all of the sightseeing that was available. 

I really loved the Happy Hour, they made sure my ""drinks"" were non-acoholic and the nachos were the best food that we tried there.

"Babystacks is a great place to start off the day - great food and reasonable prices.

The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!

I would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.

First, there are few savoury options - mostly French toast based dishes. 

I had the fried rice with pork belly and an egg. This dish was so disappointing. It was incredibly greasy- because it is served in its own grill pan the grease from the pork takes over. There was no flavour to the dish. The dish was so oily that the Chili peppers nor the soy sauce flavours came through.

"Local, comfort food with a bit of an Asian influence in this cozy Annex abode.

We started with the Mac & Cheese, which was served in a bowl of elbow macaroni swimming in cheese sauce and garnished with crispy shallots. This wasn't your basic Kraft dinner but it did have the nostalgia of eating it as a kid. The sauce was VERY saucy with a watery consistency. We kind of wished we had bread to dip in the sauce because there was that much sauce!

We were kind of glad we split the starter three-ways and didn't order a second starter as the mashups we ordered were rather large.

I ordered the Smoked Beef Brisket Mashup, which was served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with a cilantro salad and garnished with fried garlic and shallots. Alternatively, you can order your mashup as a poutine or lettuce wrap. For $17, it is a rather larger portion; big enough to go halfsies or pack up for take-out. The creamy mashed potatoes are not side order portion and is just as much the star of the dish as the brisket. The brisket is cut in chunky pieces and there's a generous portion of the brisket as well. All in all, a delicious and filling meal.

Sadly, we did not have room for dessert but it'll have to wait for a future visit.

Had it not been for You Gotta Eat Here, I would not have ventured in this part of the Annex.

Unfortunately, they didn't have anything that was featured on the show (Lamb Shepherd's Pie, Tourtiere Turnover, or Polenta).

The flavored ketchup are an acquired taste, but ok. I tried them all some I liked more than others, but you have to try for yourself.",0.0
"Great selection of slices at an expected downtown price. If you order a slice, they stick it in the oven for a little bit before serving it to you, so it's nice and hot when you eat it. 

I've tried the Gianni Ola (bacon, pepperoni, mushrooms, mozzarella, tomato sauce) and the Bianca (marinated artichokes , feta, garlic, olive oil, oregano, marinated zucchini, mozzarella). 

I preferred the Gianni but the Bianca was a nice change of pace, albeit a bit acidic with the marinade. I feel like it could have been more balanced.

There is surprisingly quite a bit of seating for a small place, about 20 or so. I'm not sure if their air conditioning was broken or if this is normal for them, but there was virtually no AC at the front and the back felt cool. So if it's hot in there (which it tends to be), venture to the back. 

The dipping sauce was a flop. I got the creamy garlic and it wasn't garlicky at all. The Pizza Pizza and Dominoes garlic dips are far superior - creamier and more garlicky.

"I came back after being turned away the first time due to ""no open seating"" despite the multitude of open reservations available online.  

To my surprise we were actually seated!    Even though the host was occupied, the bar tender stepped up immediately and helped us get seated.  He greeted us well.  We were seated in a nice little nook next to a window.  The room was very, very noisy.  Even our server (who was very sweet and friendly) could not hear what we were saying.  The overly loud ambiance seemed commonplace based on our server's reactions to the noise.

I ordered the ""crispy chicken"" which tasted like something I could have pulled out of my freezer and heated in the microwave.  It was not crispy or even very flavorful.  It came with creamed corn, which was quite dense and way too salty.  Very yellow.  The presentation was nice, however.  I also tried the fondue appetizer.  It was good, not great.

"Not sure what the big deal is? The food is ridiculously overpriced, unremarkable, and generally lackluster.  The fantastic Blooming Onion is actually overcooked and like eating the fryer residue.  The steaks are not anything special, even with their signature spices, and slightly overcooked according to their scale. When the tip is going to be huge by virtue of the high menu prices, I expect excellent service. When my water glass sits empty, that doesn't cut it.  About the only great thing here is the cheese fries.  Also, I hate the Yelp app, it nags way too much too.

"This makes me sad to write this review as I had frequently enjoyed their clams with white wine sauce before.  I ordered them again and the clams were didn't taste fresh, very gritty and seemed to be in a watery fishy broth with no seasoning.  The normal crisp bread it comes with was actually just thick untoasted bread this time.  I also had the greek salad and a glass of shiraz which along with the bread and olive oil was the best part of the meal.  The waiter was also good. I also tried the beef stroganoff that was a special and it was awful as well.  It tasted like the noodles and meat were just covered with a can of cream of mushroom soup.  Unfortunately a good glass of wine and salad isn't enough to make me return ever again.  My dining companions were not satisfied with their meals either.",0.0

The interior just fell flat design-wise.  Cheap, minimalist and uninspired.  Maybe I'm comparing the execution to Stephen Starr's Parc on Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square, and that might not be fair - because that is sort of the Gold Standard for the concept.  But, c'mon guys, warm this place up a little.  Give it some gravitas.  I want the owner's to look at Petite Chou in Indianapolis as a example of a great crowd-pleasing menu for breakfast\/lunch\/dinner\/deserts with a rather minimalist interior\/exterior (hint: not expensive - but damn, it works here and it could inspire Charlotte).

"I recently rented a car from Payless Car Rental in Las Vegas (before I had seen the reviews on Yelp). I made my reservation through the AARP\/Expedia website because the rental rate was so low I couldn't resist. You can get a decent car at a low rate from Payless BUT you need to be prepared for the representative at the counter to try to upsell you on items you may not need. For some renters, it might make sense for you to take some or all of the offered options. IF you want to save money, you need to do some homework. Check your own auto insurance to see if it covers a rental car. Also check with your credit card company to see if they provide rental car insurance coverage. Payless will offer you Roadside Assistance at $5\/day. IF you belong to AAA or have roadside assistance coverage from your auto insurance, you don't need to sign up for this option. Remember, a higher-priced rental car may already include Roadside Assistance (car breakdown) coverage in their base rental rate. Most travel sites will give you a detailed breakdown of all costs involved with your car rental when you make your reservation. You can use this to compare with your filled out rental contract when at the counter. Here is the bottom line: YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. If you go after a low-priced rental car, be prepared for a lot of pressure to purchase options that will increase the cost of your car rental. This is probably why you get more service and less hassle at rental car companies that charge more.",0.0

"Unbelievable...the first time we came here we had a horrible experience where we had someone name drop the owner of the casinos to get in on their reservation on time when we had been waiting for ours for 35 minutes. After my yelp review I was contacted and comped a meal which I really appreciated. We have since come back and had no issues until today when I talked this restaurant up to our closest friends only to have a waitress who doesn't come to the table, won't stay for more than a second, didn't ask how our food was, and what's going on with every person who works here not knowing anything about the menu? I gave this place a second chance and clearly there is a lack of direction, training, passion or even an ounce of consideration for the customer. You're in Summerlin which is probably on par with the strip on what you expect when you drop $200-$400 on a meal. There shouldn't be any issues when you're paying  $16 for an omelette that comes out bland and boring. I'm embarrassed that we brought them here to this. We won't be coming back off of shear principle. Things need to be fixed or this will be the next restaurant to turnover quickly.

"Cleveland rocks?!?! Canary's...not so much. We were just visiting Cleveland for a few days and wanted somewhere ""new"" and ""different"". When I think of diners, I think of something that has its name built from the ground up. We decided to search for something and this popped up as a choice with eh you could say decent reviews. So hubby and I jumped on it. As we pulled up to the bright yellow sign with the little yellow bird, I couldn't help but start to laugh then cracked a joke at the place being empty. Even the chef had time to go out and throw some trash away at the dumpster. Of course, us wanting to try something ""different"" still managed to get out of the car and venture inside. I politely asked the lady at the front if it was a seat yourself place, she said yes then said yes but sit on the left. So guess it changed quickly as we then turned around to go to the left. As we sat down and noticed only two guests in the dining room older than 50-60, we knew we were in for a treat. The walls and ceiling were multicolored as if it were a Mexican restaurant prior. The ceiling fans were from a 6th grade science geeks bedroom that were now collecting dust. The pie and cake display had an abundance of desserts that looked store bought. Also proudly displayed two big boxes of baking soda to keep the desserts ""fresh"". (No, we didn't get dessert) Luckily they are proactive on keeping the bugs away from the sweets with the bug trap underneath the display so we all can see. Maybe the 6th grade boy uses them for his bug collections for allowing them to rent his ceiling fans. My husband and I ordered breakfast. He ordered scrambled eggs and cheese and sausage with 3 golden brown pancakes. I ordered the pork chop breakfast with 3 over easy eggs, home fries, and toast. As the food was delivered shortly after, it didn't look terribly bad. But every thing was bland. No seasoning whatsoever. My husband could smell that his pancakes were a little on the crispy side. They tried to hide the fact that one side of the pancakes were burnt by actually placing the golden brown side up. But when you can smell the burnt you already knew to flip them over and see. He purposely cut off what he could and she most definitely saw and avoided our table. Didn't ask if we were okay or needed anything. But honestly, I would be embarrassed too. My pork chops tasted as if they were in the deep freeze for a year then flash thawed and fried with no salt or pepper. Just in straight oil. The toast was far from toast. It just seemed a little stale with Paula Deans serving of butter from 6 of her recipes on each slice. It dripped off the bread. We both didn't finish our plates. As we were getting up to leave she finally ask if we need to go boxes. I really thought she was insulting my intelligence. I guarantee she doesn't even eat there. And yes, she mentioned that it was raining cats and dogs so maybe as if we should stay until it gets done or slows down. No thanks, we are hungry for some food. This is far from a renown diner.

The food was delicious, the place was clean, the room was huge, the bed was luxuriously comfortable, and the hotel was so quiet we almost thought we were the only people staying there. It's only about a block off of the strip and has a marvelous view no matter what side of the hotel you stay on. I would say the best part was the staff, and especially the manager. We had a small problem with our room and with no questions asked, they moved us to a different room, and even delivered a free bucket of beer, a free breakfast the next morning, and a very polite apology letter from the manager himself, they really let us know that they actually cared. Don't miss out on this hotel if you're looking to stay off the strip, it's a wonderful place at an amazing price.",0.0
"Its a pub, dont expect the world from it. You go here to hangout with some family and friends have some burgers, wings and drinks. Not for a fancy meal. Go to watch sports. My family and I go here pretty regularly. The one waitress who works there (now off for Mat leave) is amazing. She pretty much runs the place by herself. She memorized our drink orders, never let our glasses get empty, never had to wait for a drink, she is unbelievable and does it all on her own, and she has a great attitude. When we have gone before and she is not there, the service is not so great. Its slow, or glasses get empty, we have to wait awhile to order, she definitly makes the place 10 times better when she is there. The have great poutine, the cheese curds are awesome. If you enjoy pub food and beer I recommend Gabbys if you arent into the pub atmosphere id look for somewhere more upscale.",0.0

This place was great.  Went on a recommendation from a friend.  The decor is hip and funky if you're into that.  The food was great. Pizza reminded me of a good New York\/New Jersey pizza.  The mac and cheese bites were awesome.  I had the stromboli.  This was an actual stomboli...there are some places out there that call a calzone a stromboli but this was legit.  Tasted great....Definitely will be back,0.0
A rare 5star rating from me. Here's the thing: I came here pretty much every Tuesday for Taco Tuesday. It's my favorite spot. Build your own taco with guac and queso specials. I was usually full before the tacos even came out. The service here wasn't always the best but the place is crowded so j always forgave them. The margaritas are delicious. This place has a cute little patio if you want some sunshine too.,0.0

"I've stayed here several times when visiting Vegas and have always enjoyed my time spent both in the hotel and the Casino. The rooms are very well appointed and you are provided with a number of upgrades. Room service is prompt and food quality is a tad better than you might expect for in room dinning. 

The Casino is very well appointed and is easy to navigate unlike some Vegas Casino's... The staff is plentiful and able to answer questions when asked an is always polite. They also have a better clientele than some of the other Casino's... they'll let anybody play but will generally not allow riff raff in, or folks who cause trouble. 

There is also a noticeable absence of working girls in the later evening and early morning hours which other hotel\/Casino's seem to have problems with. I'm sure they are there lurking, but they seem to really crack down on such so it is nice to feel like comfortable in your surroundings.

"I have been going to Evviva for over 3 years now, 1 to 2 times per month. My last visit left me wondering if I will ever go back again. The servers were abundant and quick; the kitchen was painfully slow. I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich on RYE. My wife ordered side pancakes and side bacon. After about 25 long minutes our simple meal arrived. The pancakes were cold and my Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich was served on toasted white bread. When we commented on the pancakes being cold they were replaced in a few minutes which was good. When I asked whether the kitchen ran out if rye bread our server apologized and said she would get me a side of rye bread. 10 minutes later, still nothing. Our server was shocked that the rye bread hadn't arrived and checked with the kitchen. After 5 more minutes I received toasted marbled white bread (ribbons of brown colored bread in the white). Ridiculous!! I said nothing, ate the smoked meat, left the bread and concluded a very disappointing breakfast.

"I know, a little late, but here is our review for our stay, four nights at the Flamingo, just before 4th July 2014.
We may have been lucky, no queues at check in at all, and agreed to the $30 per night upgrade. That was our first win of the trip! Took a twin Go Deluxe room, loved having the fridge by the bed. View was sorta over to Caesar's, but hey, we weren't there to look out the window anyway, just check the weather in the mornings :-)
We found the Flamingo pleasant, clean, fun, bright. My only gripe was being charged $120!!!! For a blow dry in the salon. That's just pure insanity! 
We also rented a cabana on one day (over 40 degrees Celsius, glory be it was hot!) by the pool, and appreciated the towels, water, fruit, service, and safe. Having said that though, next time we'd probably just grab a daybed, and leave everything but the room key in our room, we spent so little time in the actual cabana!

"The lodge is what it is - the perfect place for kids! We were a party of 4 adults and 4 kids (ages ranging from 2-13) staying in the Grizzly Bear Suite and it was the perfect size for us. 

It's true that the lodge is a money pit. It's a resort, so that's to be expected. Bring your own water and food to save a lot of money. Splurge on the items that you really want. You don't have to do everything to have a good time. The two older kids (8 and 13) did the Magic Quest wand activity, along with visiting the arcade and spending the majority of the time in the pool. The little ones (ages 2 and 6) spent the majority of the time in the pool and arcade. Everyone had a lot of fun.

Plan so you don't need a locker. You can bring bags into the pool area while you wait for your room to be ready. Have someone stay back and sit with them at a table. When you receive the page for your room, go drop off your bags and head back to the pool. Easy. For little ones, have them measured at the pool entrance so they receive their appropriate height wrist band so you know exactly which slides they are able to ride.

"Horrible experience. The girl who was at the shop on November 28th at around 12:51pm gave me the worst attitude ever. I asked if I could get a small box so that I can take five cookies from the 20cookies that I was going to buy and pack separately - she said yes. I took my 20cookies to the cashier and she said ""i thought you were going to buy 40 that is why I said yes to the small box"" which is ok if that is the store policy. But the way she said it makes me almost feel like i am a thief and she is letting me go this time because she is so generous. And she continues to say that i said i was going to buy 40. Come on. First i never said I was going to buy 40 cookies. Second, I cannot care less about the box -just tell me no politely if that is the store policy i would have completely understood. I almost threw the cookies at her and stormed out the store. She definitely needs to learn how to talk to customers. Will never come back to this store. I would rather fly to Hawaii.",0.0

"3.5 star food, 4.5 star service. Everyone was super friendly, and this had the feel of a local favorite rather than an assembly line steak joint. The happy hour appetizer (chips) was solid, though the on tap selection was lacking. The steak and chicken were both good, though I should have gone with the ribeye instead of the filet. The sweet potato was tasty, but the fries were average and the salads were meh.

But you don't go to a steakhouse for salad and fries. You go for meat, and the meat was good. I'd recommend this as a good local place to eat, especially if you don't want to fight Roadhouse crowds. You won't be wowed, but you won't regret your night either.",0.0

After a quick entry we found that the tryst is actually a very luxurious and well-kept club which is something that impressed me off the bat. Secondly the DJ plays in front of a beautiful waterfall that just makes everything seems so surreal. They played a good blend of both edm, hip hop, and generally good dancing music. The bartending service was excellent and friendly just be forewarned that just like any other major clubs in Las Vegas drinks aren't cheap... girls do get one free drink however. 

Overall if you're looking for somewhere for you and your friends to come and have a really good time and a memorable experience in Las Vegas without the major cover charge, the hassle of the giant line and just want good music without a specific headliner I highly recommend this place I sure had a really good time!

I would go again but split your meal with someone else unless you get something like a salad.  We did order the fried oreo sundae which was really good but I hoped for better chocolate sauce on this.  It tasted like something out of a jar.  But overall still good.

I had a mammogram at Magee in Monroeville, a UPMC facility.  That impression was totally one devoid of customer service and understanding of human interaction while this interaction was completely in touch with humans. I was greeted warmly by the front info desk staff that directed me to the mammogram area desk. They then greeted me just as warmly then led me down the hall conversing with me and asking if I'd ever been here. The waiting room I was led to??? A private room with my own sofa and flat screen TV with controls to adjust however I liked plus an area to change into not just any robe but a pretty one soft as can be fuzzy terrycloth and my own private locker. The room was not a sterile white one but with a soft color palette. 

I'm saying all this because it was so opposite my previous  Magee experience (see my review) and was so caring for such a nervous experience for this, my re-do diagnostic mammogram. 

In this same room a technician took all my info and entered it into the computer. I waited on my room with the door shut, having privacy until she came for me for the mammogram across the hall. The experience was one of her talking to me in general, being personable all the while. 

Technically, I learned this was a 3D mammagram, while the Magee location mammogram performed was not.   I waited again in my private waiting room for the radiologist to read and interpret the tesults.  My same technician, Michelle, came to tell me the results. All is good.

I forgot an item I had a coupon for which was stocked by the entrance. I had to walk my 80 bucks worth of merchandise right near the entrance. And, I guess I found all of the employees...they were hanging out by the front door as if they just had a security alert but as I look around, it's all families and kids...who could possibly be getting a watch put on them? Oh, that would probably be me. The only guy in the entire smelly store.",0.0
"I have always seen this shop on my way to work, so i decided to check out their inventory online and decided to stop in after seeing a quad for my wife.  I was greeted by the owner Chris-first impression was a very down to earth guy. He showed me the quad & gave me the details-very nice starter quad for my wife so i decided to move forward after consulting with her.  I visited the shop a total of three times-w\/the last day to finalize everything. Chris started the quad up, rode it around and showed me its functions in working form.  All the paperwork was written up, the title was in sight and when I went to swipe my card-declined! I was upset-called my Credit card company & found out they sent me another card & the one in my possesion was not valid.  I told Chris the issue, he was very understanding & I told him they will be overnighting my a new card, Ill have it on Tuesday & will finalize everything.  We shook hands, he stated he will hold the quad and looked forward to seeing me on Tuesday to finish the deal.  Tuesday comes-Im a man of my word so I call him and let him know my card will be delivered and I will be in to finish the process.  He proceeded to tell me he cant sell me the quad, cant go through with the deal because of a issue with his business and employees-something i really couldnt grasp and was looking for more answers which he coulndn't provide in detail-he was very apologetic but still, a mans word and handshake is what I go off of.  The most disapointing part was telling my wife the news after she bought her helmet & gloves online-we also rented a uhaul pickup truck & trailer to go out riding until we get a hitch installed on her SUV.  In my book, thats not good business and lost my future business to maintenance my quad that I have now & any I pick up in the future.",0.0

"I've been going here since, well I actually stopped by even before they opened, and the owner Michael came out and enthusiastically told me what it was all about. The only potential downside is a slightly high price and funky hours, but honestly, I don't mind at all and it just reflects a sincere specialness to the place. Easily some of the best food in NE ohio and possibly the best bakery. If you go at night on the weekend, dinner is fairly pricey but I'd argue very fair for what you get, especially relative to what you'd pay for that kind of meal elsewhere. It's truly top notch stuff. Also, the staff is fun and after a number of visits it really feels like a chummy, local place. The whole restaurant is a real gem for so many reasons and the first place I think of taking visitors.

"If you don't want to faint from sticker shock at Crop Bistro, Crop Kitchen is a nice alternative. You'll probably average about $10-$15 less per person at Crop Kitchen.

The service was unbeatable with informed and funny waitresses, totally armed to deal with the never-ending-questioners-about-menu people in my group and the vegetarian and vegan folks' requests. 

I enjoyed that the daily specials were projected high up on a chalkboard. I've always hated listening to waiters go on and on about daily specials--who has that kind of attention span to listen to every spice and garnish used in a dish? I'm a bigger fan of reading the specials for myself. 

As for the food, it was pretty darn good. I had the Fire Roasted Uku special of the night. This fish was FREAKIN AMAZING. It came with lentils and tomatoes soaked in a coconut curry. DELISH! The fish was pretty mild, so it's perfect for those that don't like strong fishy flavors. The curry was the perfect balance between sweet and savory, and the portion size was just right. Definitely a hit! I also sampled some of the eggnog bread pudding that a friend ordered and thought it was creamy and decadent. Definitely wished I had ordered it too! 

The only reason I'm not shelling out 5 stars is because my drink, the Uptown Punch, was just a downright disaster. I was expecting coconut and pineapple flavors and instead was greeted with a heavily alcoholic concoction with little to no flavor.

NOT ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT
On weekends, there is usually a substantial (15 min) line up just to order food and another 10 minute additional wait for most food.  The line up is indoors which is nice for inclement weather.  They post signs saying food is made to order, so allow 15 minutes for preparation --- but this is only visible once inside by the register.  So, really plan on not eating for another 30 minutes when you get in line on weekend mornings or midday (even when the farmer's market takes place).  

I think it is silly that they do not have a second cash register by now to expedite payment with this problem existing for years.  I don't mind waiting for freshly prepared food, but I do mind waiting in line that long unnecessarily because of poor planning.  Perhaps they could post some of the popular menu items on a chalkboard stand outside or through the glass window to expedite decision making at the register on weekends.  Maybe play music somewhat audibly to make the long wait more enjoyable.  Perhaps try what other I have seen successful restaurants do: Have staff walk down the line to take orders to get food started since payment and menu decisions seem to be the real bottleneck.

FOOD
Somewhat sweet biscuit breakfast sandwiches are great and have improved since opening, with biscuits being larger and more tender now.  The sausage in biscuit sandwiches is okay and obviously formed in house (don't expect Egg McMuffin sausage, it's much thicker, a bit sweeter, less spicy).  Trout biscuit sandwiches are a treat and a good differentiator.  Baked sweets (cookies, brownie\/blondie bars) are hit or miss; I have yet to have any that are truly craveable.  Still, I really appreciate the effort of using real ingredients and making them from scratch.  Owner, Brad Long, is big on buying local, being sustainable; so, you are paying a bit more for that.

DRINK
Espresso (Rufino brand) and cappuccinos are divine.  
They don't sell disposable plastic bottles of water, but rather sell reusable, collapsable (tap-filled?) water bags with sipper spouts that have a caribiner attached. 
They make their own syrups for Italian sodas, which tend be creative flavours. I was extremely disappointed in their hibiscus Italian soda.  Hibiscus is normally tangy and refreshing; when steeped, it makes a rich, red colour.  So, I can't understand why the Italian sodas I ordered barely had a tinge of pink (1\/4 the color of blush\/rose wine); they tasted awful from being horribly diluted.  I'm all about subtle flavours and not having something sickeningly sweet, but these were overly diluted.  I felt ripped off since it cost $9.61 for a large and small drink, plus we waited thirsty in line after a long hike only to be met with disappointment.  The drinks were not very cold and did not have any ice in them, so we had to ask for it and have further delay.    

PARKING
Paid parking in the lot; don't forget your license plate number since it is ticketless parking.   There is often problems paying with credit cards in the parking payment machine, so allow extra time or bring cash.  The machine by the farmer's market seems to work better for credit card than the machine by the restaurant.
Free shuttle busses from select TTC stations, however, I have found them to be infrequent at times.

Very easy access for wheelchairs and walkers.  Slightly sloped from parking lot to the door.  Chairs can pull out for wheelchairs.  I do not recall arms on chairs, though.  There are handicapped washroom stalls on ground level (no stairs).",0.0

"They messed up our entree twice, and the second time we suspected it wasn't even cooked through. Both entrees were barely edible. Was debating giving 2 stars because they threw out the bill after the second mess-up, the drinks were strong and the appetizer (blue corn pancake with duck) was tasty. Still, there's no excuse for a dinner that would be in the $100 range to be completely inedible. Was the first time in my life a restaurant failed so badly they threw out the bill.

We went last week and started with a Partida Margarita and prickly pear one. Both drinks were pretty good, very strong. Definitely didn't taste like typical mix. Pear one was a very pretty purple and came in a decent-sized glass, the Partida came in a thinner margarita glass.

They switched waiters on us like four times throughout the dinner, which was fine because it meant the service was always prompt.

The blue corn pancake with duck was delicious, but they do stress how small it is. Imagine a thin, crispy crepe about the size of your palm, filled with shredded duck meat. Still, it had a rich but not overwhelming sauce, and was cooked to be tender and flaky. Very well prepared.

For an entree, I ordered the mango chicken with some pesto mashed potatoes, and my girlfriend ordered a tuna steak done medium-well with, I believe, a risotto. 

For the tuna steak, it was a hearty chunk on top of the risotto. The risotto was rather tasty. The steak, however, was overcooked and completely dry and gray inside. We called the waiter and he immediately agreed it was way overcooked from a glance. He took it back for us, saying he would ask them to cook it Medium instead of Medium-well, in hopes that maybe it would be just right.

The chicken came served with the potatoes and two good-sized chicken breasts, it actually looked really good, and the couple next to us commented on it. It was completely dry, though. I couldn't really taste the sauce. It was blackened, and tasted very much so. The ""mango"" sauce was mostly sticky-sweet sauce with a tiny dash of spice. It could as well have been store-bought stir fry sauce. Between the two of us, we ate half of one breast while we waited for her dish to come out, and by then I was growing kind of unhappy as I realized we just ate the juiciest part and it was only getting drier the further we went, and the taste of the charred bits was becoming the most overpowering flavor.

I gave the potatoes a shot, but they were very boring and pretty uncomplimentary to the chicken.I munched on them while we waited for her steak to finish. The potatoes themselves were plain, and the pesto drizzled in was... essentially just olive oil with some basil in it. The sauce was very runny, didn't taste like nutty, and I couldn't see any grains to it. Overall, it tasted like mashed potatoes with oil-drenched basil in it.

Her steak came back and it was now undercooked. It was so wet and blubbery she struggled to cut through it, and it kept sliding around on the plate. ANOTHER waiter (not our own) actually walked by as she was cutting it open, and made a face at it, asking if we would like it to be cooked a bit more before we even asked. Meaning it was probably not even cooked through. 

She gave him the plate but at that point we were so disgusted we just asked our waiter to bring our check. I rejected a box, and he inquired why, so I explained that I didn't like my dish.

A moment later, JP, the manager walked by and apologized to us, letting us know there wouldn't be a bill. He asked for any comments, and we explained to him that both the appetizers and drinks were delicious, but the entrees were inedible. He offered us free drinks ""to go"" but we declined them.

Waited about 10-15 minutes so it wasn't too bad and luckily it wasn't too cold outside.  I knew the food was quite decent and they have good burgers, BLTs and make a tasty poutine, therefore we didn't mind the wait. If the wait time was any longer, we probably would have gone elsewhere. 
 
Prices are fairly reasonable and decor modern with a very casual ambience. Although just a little loud because it was the late night crowd. 

Service was a little slow because it was extremely busy, but server was efficient once they appeared even though they didn't check on us once we got our food.

I ordered the BLT which had a good amount of bacon that was cooked to a nice crisp with fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The BLT was served on ciabatta bread and came with a side order of fries which were fresh, crispy, and lightly salted.  

My friends both had the fried chicken which they said was good, so I'll take their words for it as I'm not a big fan of fried chicken, but will try it next time since that seems to be another favourite of the diner.

The ceremony and reception areas overlook beautiful Fountain Hills. We even saw the famous fountain go off! 

The only thing I would change was that the ceremony and reception were outside and it was very hot. Only a few of the tables had shade umbrellas so after about 30 minutes in the sun we had to stand under a tree so we didn't melt. The dance floor was also not shaded which made dancing uncomfortable. However, the indoor lounge was available to guests who were getting too hot.

"Kevin seems like a nice guy. However I think he is either overwhelmed or just has really poor customer service skills. When I first called him  Monday of last week, I was expecting him to come out and give me an estimate for installing a new high efficiency pump, a new light fixture, not just a bulb and repair my leaky backwash bulb. He told me he had established pricing for all of these repairs. I found this rather odd as he had no idea of any variables that he might find after he got there. The estimate was for $1800, not a huge amount but I was expecting customer service commensurate to the opportunity. I reluctantly agreed to have the work done. Kevin said that he was pretty busy and would  get back to me regarding scheduling. Once again I had to initiate a call to him. I spoke to his answering service at 9:30AM on Monday of this week and the person that I spoke with told me she would get a hold of Kevin right away. I got a call back at 2:30 PM telling me I was on for today April 1st. Kevin called me at 9:15 and told me that I was on for today but he first had to drive to Eloy, AZ to do a warranty repair. He would call me later when he was close to my home. At 2:30 I finally called Kevin and asked about his ETA. He told me that yes he was back in town but, he was installing another pump and would be at my house next. Frustrated I said to forget it as I thought he was unreliable and unprofessional. Choose this guy only if you don't care when or if your repair actually happens. The previous reviews  seem to show a petty strong trend of unreliable behavior.",0.0

"Came here after work one day with a couples of co-workers.  The place was pretty busy and lively for a Tuesday night.  We walked in with reservations and were seated right away.  It was too bad that the weather wasn't as nice because they do have a nice patio area with umbrellas.  I thought that the restaurant could have used a bit more lighting as we all had a hard time trying to pick a beer to start off with because we couldn't see much.  Might I add that the beer menu that they provide is like a booklet with all different types of selections of beer.  There was Pale Ale, Amber Ales, Ciders, Beer Cocktails and many many more.  Not only was there a Bible of Beers but they had daily specials for food and drinks depending on the day that you visit.  The waitress that helpful with suggestions to beers that may have appealed to our likings and very accommodating.  She offered to take our orders for drinks before everyone got seated but everyone was so indecisive about what they wanted.  I finally decided to order a Palm Speciale (Pale Ale) along with a Beef and Cheddar Poutine (24-hour Leffe Brune Abbey Ale-braised beef, aged white Cheddar, roasted mushrooms, Markt frites, pan gravy) and their Dunkel Duck Wings to share with the boyfriend.  We devoured the Beef and Cheddar Poutine (must-try deliciousness) and the Duck Wings (slow-braised duck drumettes, fried crisp, dry spice-rubbed, gold BBQ and hot lingonberry dipping sauces) were not too bad, although the boyfriend wasn't as much of a fan as I would.  He described them to be a little on the dry side since he likes his duck meat to be fatty.  My co-workers ordered the Pretzel Calamari (pretzel-crusted, fried crisp, harissa aioli, house-made rémoulade, fresh lemon - which I thought tasted like regular battered calamari), the Classic Poutine (Québec cheese curds, Markt frites, pan gravy ) and their Markt Wings (in Butter, Salt and Pepper).  The second round of beers, I decided to go with one of my favourites, Delirium, but sadly, they sold out of it and I got a Ceres instead (which was supposed to be similar to the taste of Delirium).  All in all, good time with good company and I will come back for more taste-testing of different beers.",0.0

"This place has the best pizza. It's tasty and flavourful yet healthy too. If you ask politely, most of the staff members will even make you a pizza just the way you like it. Their falafel is super tasty and filling too. Their fries, onion rings, and soups are really delicious. Seating is limited and the restaurant is often busy especially in the afternoon and evening. But, in terms of customer service, this place is not the best and I've experienced much better.

And now, the negative aspects. First, every time I order soup, it is always served stone cold and when I ask the staff to warm it up, they get all huffy about it. Next, some of the staff members aren't very nice. I called in a dine-in order once and it wasn't ready on time when my family arrived at the restaurant. Then, when I politely asked one lady behind the counter about my order status, she rudely answered that the food will be ready when it's ready and that I shouldn't meddle in things that I don't know about. How very rude and inconsiderate! I was merely attempting to find out why my order was taking so long to fill out and this lady was so full of attitude. So now I attempt to spare myself from utter humiliation by just ordering my food in person. I will never call in an order again. Lastly, the tables are never clean and I have to use napkins and clean my table myself.

Very high production value for a dance show.  Beautiful theater.  The singers were amazing.  Great dancers in this show but thought the choreography did not work in some of the routines. Gorgeous costumes. The voiceover in this show has got to go.  The guys voice is dreadful.  The performances in the production are all classic Broadway show tunes that most people will know.  You don't have to spell it out for us with a voiceover.  Audiences are not stupid.  Get rid of the voice over and let the actors do their job!!  They can handle it.

Also, if you're going here... expect delays. It's like the servers hate doing their jobs. It takes them forever to take orders, to give you your check, to clean the tables, etc.  I'm not sure if they're all just being lazy or they're just not properly trained. It's not even busy.

"We went to this location because it was closer to our hotel. We went to the one in Surprise, AZ yesterday and that one was great.

Then we were told they didn't sell chocolate milk. Then they argued about it and we're rude to my wife about it. The majority of the food appeared to be inedible. Now I'll say they got one star cuz the steak was good and so was pot roast and the banana pudding was excellent. Our waitress was very kind and courteous and kept our drinks filled and table cleared even though being very pregnant. Now let me tell you about the filth!!!

"Barolo is such a wonderful addition to this area of E Washington. Parking is easy and available along the street out front, and it's far enough away from the busyness of Capitol Square to be considered a more intimate venue for wine and cocktail sipping. 

The outdoor patio adorned with plants and lights is also a wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine. 

Barolo is aiming to be one step above many ""wine bar"" establishments popping up as of late, and they succeed (in my book). The vino list is eclectic and well-curated, and after a brief glance at the food offerings I was quite impressed with what they have put together. Upon chatting with the friendly and knowledgable bartender, he divulged that the entire concept of the leased space is divided into separate entities offering specific amenities in a convenient manner. The farthest tenant to the back is a southern-inspired restaurant, then there is Barolo, and then a coffee shop closest to the entrance (which was yet un-opened on our visit). I thought it a clever arrangement of establishments, and wish the minds behind the idea all the best with their endeavors. 

I'm excited to be back and enjoy another glass of wine with friends.

"This place is absolutely awful!!! I wish it were possible to give it NEGATIVE stars! I have a galaxy S4 that was just bought in August. Its a relatively new phone that, aside from the cracked screen, had ZERO problems. I dropped it on Tuesday and cracked the screen. On Wednesday Oct 21, 2015 I took my phone into this location to get the screen replaced. I dropped it off at 11am and the girls quoted me $140 and told me it would be ready by 2pm. I waited until 3pm just to be safe as I don't live anywhere near this location and didn't want to wait around if it wasn't ready. When I showed up they told me my phone wasn't ready yet. At this point they've now had my phone for 4 hours. It doesn't take 4 hours to replace a screen and this isn't a busy location. That being said, I left and came back at 4pm. It STILL wasn't done yet. So I waited another 20 minutes. When I finally got my phone, I noticed the bottom buttons weren't working. I told the girls behind the counter and the ""technician"" (if you can even call her that) about the problem. They took my phone into the back and did something to it. When they brought it back up the bottom buttons were working but there was a Safe Mode icon at the bottom of the screen. I asked her what that was and to take it off my phone as it wasn't there prior to bringing it in. She couldn't figure out how to do it and was just randomly going through apps and settings trying to figure it out; and in the process she reset my phone. When she got the safe mode icon off finally, the bottom buttons weren't working again. She took my phone apart and told me the strip that controls the touch sensors is broken and will need to be replaced. Then proceeded to tell me I would have to pay $60 to replace it. Basically SHE broke that strip ripping apart my phone and expected me to pay for her mistake. We argued about it and she ended up agreeing to fix it for free. But then told me my phone wouldn't be ready until 6:30pm. I left and came back at 6:30 and my phone was still in pieces. I waited around for another 30 minutes for her to put it back together. At this point she had my phone for EIGHT HOURS! I got it back and at first glance it seemed fixed. But then I went to use the camera and the frontal facing camera doesn't work at all!!! The fact that this crappy store caused so much damage to my phone and still charged me is ridiculous. Their technicians are absolutely incompetent and untrained.

The Amazing Grace roll is one of my favorites. The staff is ALWAYS friendly, including the very attentive sushi chefs. My ONLY complaint is that seating is extremely limited. Plan on waiting if you go during normal dinner time. If you like extremely plain sushi, this might not be your place. But if you like sushi with multiple flavors exploding in your mouth at once, you will love this place!",0.0

Recently they hired a new girl who is less then friendly, my now friendly chats are no longer when she is working i a lucky to get a hello. She is down right rude.

He was so happy with this place, from the decor to the food. I was happy, but if I go I'll get something other than the burger. (I know. I got a burger. Its my own damn fault.) It was good, and the sauce was delicious, but I was totally jealous of my boyfriend's pork belly and spicy salmon sushi (super filled with fish and tasty as f). Plus it came with frites, which I as assuming was a trendy way of saying fries and was expecting just that but it game with fries cut so thinly (think shoestring onions) that it was kinda weird to eat. Not very substantial, and definitely not a good first date food. I looked so goofy shoving them in my mouth. They were great for picking at once the sake kicked it, however!  Complementary wasabi peas were a nice touch. Also ordered the oysters which were great, yet pricey.

"For one we've traded in our 07 Honda years ago here and they still call us repeatedly asking if we want to trade it in still...Harassing much and dumb? Especially because we've told them to take us off their phone lists before. I think we paid too much for the 07 Honda like 17,000 when it already had 70,000 miles on it. I was happy with the salesperson who sold us our 2013 Honda, but not so much the 07. That person first tried to talk my fiancé into buying a car that wouldn't even start (even after he got jumping cables) and he didn't want-some Pontiac sports car. Also, I hate when they take you into the back to talk financing and throw all these warranties at you and completely change what you've already agreed to before as far as payments pricing. It is truly intimidating and quite frankly pretty rude how they do this in order to get you to buy this and that extra stuff. They also do this for several hours so by the end of it you're so tired you just agree to it. I wouldn't really recommend this dealership personally.",0.0

They also left me sitting and soaking in the bowl for over 30 min before someone started my service. This is why I didn't give 5 stars. However, I absolutely loved the finished product and artwork.

"I am writing about my experience in leasing my first Mercedes- a 2015 GLK 250. My fiance and I came into the dealership this week, after a couple of months of searching through used GLK's and wanting information on a new vehicle lease. We did not think that our budget would allow us to lease a new vehicle and we were simply looking for information. The sales associate, Geoff Mokry, spent a solid 2+ hours working with us, answering our questions, and providing information on various discounts available to us. He took us for a test drive and was very thorough in explaining all the features of the vehicle. Geoff was able to get the lease price to a number that was within our budget, and we ended up with not only our dream car, but a brand new and fully loaded one! We picked up the vehicle yesterday and again, Geoff was so helpful in explaining all aspects of the vehicle to us. He has been a pleasure to work with and we could not be happier with our experience in leasing our first Mercedes Benz!",0.0

"There are quite a few varying reviews on this property.  I was here for a 5 day class, so I did not want to spend a ton of money on a room that I would not be in for 99% of my stay.  I needed something inexpensive, close to the strip, clean, with Free WiFi.  This property fit the bill.

Again, I acknowledge the many poor reviews, but decided for the price, this met all my requirements.

The first day did not start so well, its a 2 story property with no elevator, so I hauled my bags to the room across the property.  The front desk person keyed my room incorrectly.  So I had to trudge down to the front desk and get a new key.

I finally get into my room and it is clean, but there is a musty smell.  I search around and someone(housekeeping) left a wet towel behind the door.  This of course tells me mopping sweeping of the bathroom, is not so consistent.

Moving on through the week, everything is pretty good.  Room is clean, towels are exchanged.

Last night was a disaster.  I come home after a long day, and beds are not made, towels still on the floor.  I call down to the front desk ask what happened to housekeeping.  They tell me, ""Sorry nothing they can do Housekeeping has gone for the day"".  Since it was my last day, I say fine just take a portion off my bill.  Thirty minutes later (18:00), when housekeeping was supposed already gone, shows up with their cart.  I am tired and hungry and getting ready to shower, so I tell them do not worry about it.

Upon heading out to dinner, I stop by the desk to take care of some administrative work, and also remind them to give me a credit for my housekeeping not coming in.  The front desk person says, they got the note and will investigate in the morning.  I tell them there is nothing to investigate my room was not done, and would like a resolution before I check out early the next morning.  They then turn to another supervisor who says they can send a houseman up to clean my room.  I tell them no, I am on my way out for dinner.  THey then tell me since I am ""refusing"" service there will be no credits.  I tell them fine come clean my room, it is now 18:40 how long?  The response was, ""there are 2 requests ahead of you so you will have to wait"", I press again how long since i was tired and hungry.  The response, ""there are 2 requests ahead of you, and I wont discuss this further with you"".

I waited another 30 minutes for the houseman to clean my room.

No longer wanting to deal with front desk staff and their lack of customer service, I sent an email to the property general manager.

Mark, the GM, responded quickly, and provided me a credit for 1 nights stay.

I visited this store at 8pm there was one sales person on the floor which he stated he was the only one working and had a customer so couldn't help us at the moment after sitting in the store for 55 minutes another sales person comes walking from the back of the store and asks if we needed help after waiting for 55 minutes with no help so he tried to help us with the purchase of 2 phones but was unable to help us due to something out of his control but the point is if there is 2 sales people there they should both be on the floor while there is myself plus 3 other customers waiting. If I was able to leave no stars I would but that's not an option.  The customer service was no good at the store the customer service was no good from calling 611.

"The thing about this place is you have to temper your expectations before going.

As I'm sure countless others have pointed out, this is a cheap grungy student pub.  The food is mediocre pub food, but it gets the job done.  I had the wings on half price night, and for $5 that pound of wings went down nicely with $5 bucket of onion rings and the $15 jug of Amsterdam Blonde.

Was it the best wings\/rings\/beer ever? No, but for the price it was very good.  Also, I got the wing sauce on the side, as it seems from other reviews that they may drown their wings in it normally.

"Went to see a movie with friends and was surprised to find out that it was indeed a dinner and a movie type deal, where dinner is served in the movie theater. I was kind of excited, it seemed like a cool idea- and went into it with a very open mind.   I wasn't particularly impressed.  Tickets were cheap, the food was not, but obviously they've got to pay for the TONS of staff somehow.  I got two adult beverages and an entree, including the tip and the movie ticket for just under 45 dollars.  This, I expected.  

What I didn't expect was for the ""tray table thing"" to be wobbly and uneven, causing me to have to hold my drink for the duration of the movie to avoid it tipping over.  I also didn't expect the food to be bland and cold, however, I suppose that to accommodate a full theater of movies goers at approximately the same exact time, you have to have some items already prepared.  I got a margherita pizza, and it tasted fine... bland and cold but it's a movie theater... I wasn't expecting much.  Long island ice tea was very, very sweet- but fine.  It was huge, however I don't think there was much alcohol in it.  

Checks come about halfway through.  If you plan to get to the movie late, I guess you better hope they have the menu online cause its impossible to read it in the dark theater.  Also, its not the place to see a movie where minute details are important, as you will lose some clarity when wait staff comes and goes during the film, you have to pay your check, etc.  Much louder than a usual movie though, I assume to accommodate the hustle of staff.

Cool experience, I'd go again, it would truly depend on the type of movie.  ON a side note, the location in the EpiCentre is AWESOME.  Cool view of the city, neat place to be on a Friday or Saturday with live music and other attractions.  Parking sucks, arrive early.",0.0

This is by FAR the most delicious sandwich I have ever had. The double crunch bread is AMAZING! Do yourself a favor and have this for lunch!,0.0
"Decided to have my sons birthday here with the main goal of tiring everyone's kids out. We booked online which was fairly easy. It was really a bummer that they only allowed us 15 minutes before our jump time to set up our room. The party room upstairs was set up nicely but we did have lots of decorations to put up so that took some time away from me being able to experience what Gravady had to offer. In between setting up and checking people in throughout the party I was only able to jump with the kids for less than 5 minutes before it was time to get back to the party room. The attendant we had was very helpful in serving our guests and cleaning up spills\/messes. Everyone really enjoyed the experience and for many it was their first time going to Gravady. It is kind of pricey for just one hour especially when guests show up late and have only 30 minutes to jump. To offset the cost we made our own food so the fact that they let you bring in basically whatever you want really helped. The facility was very clean and bigger than I expected.. the only weird thing is that the jumpers either go barefoot or have to purchase gravady socks at $4 a pair. I'd much rather have the socks become a requirement and pay the price instead of thinking about all those dirty feet all over the place. The only suggestion I have for the staff is to think about how they can streamline the check in process or make is easier so that the host of the party doesnt have to run back and forth to check people in. And maybe space out party times by 30 mins instead of 15 so that we have enough time to set up and are able to enjoy the facility with our guests. Other than that, everyone had a blast and im sure they slept soundly that night also!",0.0
