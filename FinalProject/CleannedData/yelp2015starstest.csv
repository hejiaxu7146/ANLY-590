"My friends and I had dinner last night at the Palm.  What a great experience.  Sat outside so we could people watch as shoppers moved back and forth through the the Forum shops. The meal was delicious and our server, was a pure joy.  He was extremely attentive, informative, and fun.  Super friendly!  For dinner I ordered the bacon wrapped scallops which were cooked to perfection, flavorful, succulent, a super treat for the palate.  For the main course I had the crab cakes, also very good.  Large portions and more than I could eat.  My guests had the lobster bisque soup, a filet that was cooked to perfection and a delicious shrimp, avacado salad.  Both parties raved about their choices.  I will admit that this was second time to the Palm, the first time was years ago before Yelp and Trip Advisor, but it was also a pleasurable experience.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I rented a property from RSN for 1 year and recently moved out. Manny and the entire staff at RSN made dealing with a property management company very easy. Never did we have any problems with them and their customer service was always on point. We did have a couple issues with the owner during the year we lived there, but Manny was completely understanding of our concerns and dealt with the owner. Owner issues aside, Manny and RSN really take care of their customers and I would recommend them to anyone I know looking to rent a home in southern Nevada. Great service and easy to work with.

"Capo's Speakeasy is a fun place to take a group of friends! You have to ring the bell for access, but before they let you in they open the little window door and ask who you are....you know, like a Speakeasy....cute idea!
Prerty dark inside (reason for the 4 not 5 stars). I like to see my food a little more. They have a Frank Sinatra type singer who makes the rounds to all the tables thru out the night. They also have a magician who was AWESOME!! Everyone really enjoyed their dinners! 
The pasta is fresh made which is always a plus! I'm a picky vegitarian and my Linguini Ariabatti was excellent with just the right amount of spice. Angels with Dirty Faces (movie title) Angel Hair pasta w\/peas,mushrooms, pepperoni w\/a vodka type sauce. The chicken dish our friend had was also a winner!!! We'll definitely be returning to Capo's Speakeasy!",1.0
"Best shawrma place ever, I come here 4 times a week and the owner is very nice! Highly recommend if you're in the area.",1.0
"Had another shop leave a piece out of my front end after the Last alignment. It killed a $500 set of tires. The guys at Car Guys fixed everything and had to do 3 alignments, mounted an balanced the new tires and replaced the parts that were missing for less than the first shop charged for the bad alignment. You will be treated like family here!",1.0
"The food here is delicious! We didn't stay overnight and just had dinner before heading back to Toronto. It's a hidden gem and comparable to fine dining restaurants in downtown Toronto. Bartlett Lodge is located in Algonquin Park on the opposite side of Cache Lake. It's a short complimentary boat ride to get there.

 Dinner is a 5 course menu consisting of your choice of charcuterie (how many choices you get depend on how many people are in your party), complimentary bread, a choice of 4 appetizers, daily soup, palette cleanser, and a choice of 4 mains and desserts. All the dishes were well seasoned and not overly salty. The duck and beef tenderloin were both cooked perfectly. Although everything was tasty, the highlight for me was dessert. You can't go wrong with phyllo wrapped cheesecake in a Jack Daniel's caramel sauce!",1.0
"On the way to the Barrett Jackson auto auction I yelped breakfast.  Right off the 101 I pulled in and the place was packed, good sign! We were seated before expected and as we browsed the menu an employee stacking chairs asked if we needed any assistance with the menu, to my surprise he was able to answer all of my questions and made note that he was the only restaurant that cracked their own eggs and his coffee was from a local coffee shop just down the street. No longer after we ordered, my coffee was topped off twice and the meal was on the table. The breakfast was excellent, service staff was very professional and efficient. All hand selected by the man stacking chairs. 

On the bucket list for my next trip to Scottsdale AZ",1.0
"Was skeptical of the 5 star review but after eating there the food speaks for itself. It's made in front of you. Food was a bit hot fresh off the burner, so I had a chat with the friendly staff as it cooled off. Was filling and satisfying, would definitely eat there again.",1.0
"By far my favourite thai food place.  Been there over 5 times, and ordered a few times as well.  My favourites are Tofu Suko Thai Pad Thai and the green and red curry dishes.  Also getting the garlic tofu (for vegetarians) is a must.  No complaints about this place, will always be one of my favourites.  Look forward to trying out Khao San Road",1.0
I've only had the donuts but god damn they were good. They are soft and perfect for sneaking into a movie and eating quietly.,1.0
"Excellent food, outstanding service, inviting and comfortable atmosphere....love this place.
Been here only a few times so far, but  everything that my wife and I tried is just wonderful. The staff\/servive is awesome.

Great place for lunch\/dinner. The fresh bread, and the wood fired salmon is second to none. What are you waiting for...",1.0
"They're good people doing something they enjoy and it shows! I was late and they were so kind about it, they didn't rush me or my appointment. The sonographer took her time, explained everything and I could tell she truly cared about getting good images for my family and I. The room is cozy, generous comfy seating, and she even warms the jelly :) the value is incredible, their prices simply cannot be beat! Such a great experience!",1.0
"I was in a hurry and opted to try this place b\/c it was close to my house, wasn't too sure because of a few reviews so I didn't do a mani at that time. Because of how friendly Kim & Anna were to me and my mom, we are back the very next day! They just had new massage chairs put in and they are worth the price of the pedi. I was very happy with their work, I say give 'em a try!",1.0
We went during happy hour. The rolls were great. I loved the dumplings! Service was excellent....definitely going back. I love the edamame they bring to the table while you wait.,1.0
Nice place. The sunrise burrito is yummy. My husband was looking for something gluten-free and the only option was oatmeal- not his usual choice. I like the cozy fireplace in the corner.  Hubby says the coffee is pleasantly rich. :-),1.0
"Probably the best hotel I've stayed at. I received the military discount and this is the best discount on a hotel I've ever received.  This place is a modern luxury masterpiece. The rooms, elevators and building itself is immaculate.  Everyone was very nice and the staff was super friendly as well.  The rooftop bar was pretty awesome as well.  Overall, great hotel and this will always be my number one hotel to stay at when I am back home in Cleveland!",1.0
Great local spot.  The service was friendly and prompt.  The food was very very good. I will definitely be back.  The tom kha is really delicious. Wow.,1.0
Food was exceptional...not to mention the mudslide.  Amy was our bartender and did a terrific job getting our food in a timely manner. Keep up the good work Amy.,1.0
"OK, if it wasn't 11:09 p.m., maybe Federico's would only get four stars, but when you're in need of Mexican and everywhere else is closed or far away, five stars is the least Federico's deserves.

Probably won't visit very often, but it's definitely on my list of ""go to"" places late at night.",1.0
"Little bit far from where I live but still gave it a try. 
Had the zombie rolls, curry, and pad thai. Really like their dessert and the thai ice tea. 
Quiet and good environment with friendly staff.",1.0
Second visit and still very pleased. They go above and beyond and are very friendly! Lots of colors and clean!,1.0
Great Company.  Very patient with my very picky wife.  Tony explained everything to her and my satisfaction.  Patrick handled the install.  Great guy.  Very professional.  Careful with the house and  got along with the dog.  We absolutely love the windows.  Best price after looking at several other companies.  Save your time and just go with them.  They are pros all the way around.,1.0
"I found Paradise Med Spa while next door to the Barber Shop called The Manor. After my hair cut while i was chilling by the fire, a friendly staff member next door come over to speak to me about a broken blood vessel i had on my face that Joel the barber and i talked about. I mentioned that i have wanted to get that fixed for a long time and Janet went over my options on how to laser treat it. I didn't know much about the treatment and she went into great detail on the safety procedure and how the owner, a doctor, has researched, studied and preformed hundreds of these painless techniques. I set up an appointment and they went to work.

I felt relaxed as Melissa and Janet worked together to isolate and zap the broken capillary. They also reduced the redness around my cheeks and evened out my face tone. In no time i was in and out. A pleasant experience. Professional and Experienced.",1.0
"Love this place, whenever I go china town to run errands or buy food i always take sometime to grab a coffee and just check out the free exhibits or just to go sit in here and rest up.",1.0
"Wow.  This was pretty spectacular.  Was taken there on the way back from the airport by some friends who live in Brampton.  Advertised as North America's biggest buffet and while I'm not sure about that, it was certainly well worth it.  Curries were good, naan was excellent, love that they have a pani puri and chaat station and that they have a wide selection of indian sweets.  All the western food I can do without but the rest was great.  Also I love the decor, all the Bollywood stars who've visited with headshots on the walls and the fabulous statues.  Definitely worth it.",1.0
"I've taken my car here several times, and the service has always been great! Pricing is fair, and if you need something in a pinch, they can generally see you on the same day. They will also give you a ride home or to work if it's going to be a long wait, which is super convenient - no waiting around! Definitely recommended.",1.0
"I had the steak and watercress sandwich and the lobster bisque soup.  I must admit, they were awesome!!! The workers there are friendly and the atmosphere was very relaxing. Plus, they have a military discount so that's an A+++ in my books. Thank you for the outstanding service and good quality food!",1.0
"As a Chicago native I have grown accustomed to eating mediocre Italian, Mexican, Chinese etc. in central Illinois. But I wok rises above the average fray and then some. The building is new the lighting is great the woman at the desk could take an order with only minimal confusion. 

The food was astoundingly delicious. Simplicity is key when it comes to Chinese food. Don't reinvent the wheel just provide me with that American Chinese taste I have had my whole life, and please make it fresh. The most notable thing about my girlfriends sweet and sour chicken was the almost non existent grease in the container. My sesame chicken was phenomenal as well. And hot damn were the portion sizes generous. I ordered the large and I am confident it will be able to feed me through 2 more meals.

18 dollars for 2 large portion chicken meals. Surely will be back again.",1.0
"There are very few vape lounges with staff as friendly and helpful as chad. Im from So Cal and this place carries some of the best juice around.  Thank you vape co for carrying my fave ""kilo""!!!",1.0
"The food reminds me of when i travel to parts of Europe. A beautiful presentation great flavors, the piano playing, the decor on the wall. Customer service is awesome, they make you feel special. The chicken dish is good and the tuna is delicious. Nice Wine selection.The food could make the cover of Bon appetit magazine.",1.0
"My baby Butters always receives wonderful treatment from Dr. Alex Casuccio and team. This summer we took our lil girl with us to the Bahamas and THANKFULLY we made a pre-trip visit to Dr. C to go over paperwork. An hour later the whole team was still researching and doing everything possible to make sure Butters had the necessary documentation. 

The actual process of arriving\/departing Nassau Bahamas with a dog was nothing short of a nightmare. I am eternally grateful that Dr. C and the team were so thorough! Even with all the correct paperwork we were hustled\/threatened upon arrival of Butters being quarantined or ""destroyed"". Will gladly send proof to any pet parent thinking about a family trip to the island.

SO THANK YOU Dr. C & team!!! If not for your tireless research and attention to detail I definitely would have made headlines on the evening news!",1.0
"Quite a workout for an hour. You can book the court exclusively with 20 ppl or share the space with others including walk-ins. Recommended that you book online ahead especially on weekends and nights. Masks were cleaned before the start of the sessions. 

Instructions were quick and arrive early for some practice time. We had a group of 13 and you will still have a chance to aim at your friends with one of the games where you change sides once you get hit. Overall, everyone in group liked the event and they took pictures at the end of the session. 

Marshmallows at arrow tip didn't hurt but many had bruises on their bow arm by end of session. Many in the group would return. Definitely winter sport but lets see what they come up with when weather is warmer.",1.0
"Pretty good souvenir shop. Lots of Vegas merchandise at reasonable prices. I believe they have 2 floors, but we browsed the first floor which is on the Strip. Didn't give them 5 stars as they neglect to tell you about a $.50 cent surcharge. 

Aside from that sneaky surcharge, you'll find some awesome deals here. Shot glasses 4\/$5, magnets 2\/$1, cups and coffee mugs ranging from $1.99-$4.99. All sorts of deals for all types of wallets.

It's directly across the street from MGM. Go to the rain forest in the MGM and exit the hotel by that wing, once you walk out it literally 10-15 steps. If you're in the NYNY then use over pass by Herseys second floor exit and walk the half block. Enjoy peeps",1.0
Smoke is the single greatest ingredient and this place is by far the best smokehouse around.  I've been to many places around rural redneck America that don't even come close to how good this place is.  The ribs are perfection and so are the smoked chicken wings.  Even the homemade sauces blow any high end shelf bought sauces out of the water.  I recommend this place to anyone and everyone and if yelp provides a 6th star I would select it for Memphis BBQ.,1.0
"I just took my 1999 Dodge Ram 1500 pickup here.  I was in and out in 30 minutes flat, exactly the price they quoted me over the phone. I'd definitely do business with them again. Friendly staff, clearly know what they're doing!",1.0
"Great price, atmosphere, service, food and drinks! We went here for a date night and will definitely go back again. We got a seat on the patio which I highly recommend. They have a great selection of different draft beers and upscale bar food. We enjoyed the The Cutting Board, Ahi Tacos and Short Rib entree. Everything was on point!!!",1.0
"Six of us met here Saturday evening before heading to see live theatre. Place is steps from the St. Lawrence Centre for the arts. 
The restaurant has a casual, upscale ambiance. We started with drinks and appetizers. Drink offerings are very diverse and well paired to meals. Complimentary bread, baked onsite, arrived to the table warm and toasted. 
For main courses we tried the Lamb Burger, albacore Tuna and beef short rib entrees. All were beautifully presented and so flavourful. Paired with fresh herbs, vegetables and exotic ingredients such as coconut milk, it was a meal that will last in our minds for some time. To top things off, for desert we tried the chocolate deluce and lemon custard with coffee. Absolutely wonderful. This restaurant is great for dates, medium sized gatherings or just stopping in for a drink and appetizer.",1.0
"Best neighborhood restaurant - it's the kind of spot you want to hit up weekly. Not a pizza on the menu that isn't amazing, excellent service and a relaxing ambiance. If it's not on your list it should be!!",1.0
The food and service is fantastic! A must stop when in Vegas! It is hard to find a really great BBQ place!,1.0
It took me a long time but finally found a place I can go regularly for hair cuts. I think I've had my hair cut by everyone in there and have been happy. The only thing I don't like is the price: $15 for men's haircuts. I guess that's just the price these days!,1.0
"As usual, good service, good food. I miss the way they used to bring the Margarita in a shaker. Still, it was good also.  I highly recommend this place. Bring your thick wallet.",1.0
"Stopped in for a late lunch around 3pm. Not very crowded, but yet our service was very slow. I would be worried about how long it would take to get your food during peak meal times. The food was good. We got the chicken sandwich and fish sandwich. Great ambiance!",1.0
"This is not fast food, but the fried catfish is well worth the wait.

Always polite and never a bad entree... I would never do the drive-thru but again this is not fast food... It is cooked fresh if you come in.",1.0
"I checked this place out after I was recommended it by a friend. Being Italian, I'm usually very critical of Italian restaurants, but I was extremely impressed by NODO. Not only was the food top tier, but the service was impeccable. 

I will definitely be back here again!",1.0
"My first time at an Aroma Expresso bar and I loved it. It is a refreshing change from Starbucks, and although I am not a fan of franchised anything, I really enjoyed the ambiance, service and fresh products this location had to offer. Yes they have pastries and snacks, but it was the coffee I came for and they did not disappoint. I went with something very simple. An Expresso with a some vanilla icecream. Simple, but very delicious. I am sold and will definitely try one of their other locations sometime soon!",1.0
"Drs David Poelman, Ruth Bergloff, and Jonathon Bergloff are awesome dentists and leaders in the East Valley in Oral Heath Care. As an Oral Surgeon I am exposed to many patients coming from a variety of Dental offices in town. I have found their dental work to be superb and their staff FANTASTIC. I recommend them without reservations.",1.0
This place is absolutely un-believable! The food was impeccable as well as the spirits. The Spanish flare was great and not what I was expecting. Went with 4 people and told them to just keep bringing out the best plates they have until we were full. The Gin and Tonic presentation was amazing - nothing like I've seen before. Will be back for sure,1.0
"Staff is very friendly - made a specialty recommendation for me when I told them it was my first time in. I got an iced London Fog which is nothing short of delicious if you're in the mood for something out of the ordinary!

Drinks are served in real ceramics\/glassware if they are for dine in, which is always a plus for me. Additionally, the atmosphere is light and airy. All the outside seating was (unfortunately) taken, but the inside was bright and had lots of natural light.

Will return when in Shadyside next!",1.0
"Marco was a HUGE help! I recently switched to a different carrier from T-Mobile (worst mistake) Marco made the process of switching back to T-Mobile easy. He even gave me a handshake for making the right decision to switch back to T-Mobile from that other carrier. I got my same number back and didn't have to pay nothing for switching back. I plan to stick with T-Mobile because of him and the excellent customer service he gave at the store. The other carrier simply didn't fulfill my needs like they said they would offering superior internet coverage which was false in my area of town (west valley) T-Mobile has great 4G LTE coverage in my area! If you come to this store ask for ""MARCO"" he was a HUGE help! He really wanted me to come back to T-Mobile and wasn't going to let anything get in the way from me switching back. Marco made it happen! Thank you so much! Major thumps of to Marco was the EXCELLENT customer service I had at this store!",1.0
"If you're in the mood for a cold treat then this is the perfect place to stop by in south Chandler to get one! Although they have many extra healthy options, I'm not a fan of those .. I guess when I do dessert, I have to go all out! Lol. My go-to is the cake batter fro yo with marshmallow sauce & chopped almonds.

The staff is always really friendly and the interior is really modern & clean. Definitely stop by when you get a chance!",1.0
"Love the decor, rooms are clean and beautiful. The atmosphere is upscale and fun. No smokey casino. 

Getting in and out is easy. I prefer the tower closer to the strip. 

Eat at Henry's for breakfast. The breakfast burrito is to die for. 

Make sure to try the secret pizza place while you're there. 

Early gambling minimums are reasonable and the craps tables get hot.",1.0
"Be sure to grab the padded part of the doors leading to the dining room!

Interior is quite large for a fast food place.  Decor is red and gray\/chrome.  Like a fast food diner, or quick-serve version of Red Robin.  The cashier was competent and cordial.

I ordered a vanilla shake with Mint syrup.  It's very ""fluffy"" and less dense than ice cream\/soft serve\/yogurt.  I also love the extra large super wide straw!  It was very creamy, but not too thick.

I've yet to try their food, but I can definitely endorse the frozen custard.  Price was about $5 for a large shake.",1.0
"This is my neighbourhood coffee spot...well about 3miles away but worth every journey. From their ever friendly and helpful staff to their meticulously hand crafted menu this is a great place to have coffee and hang out! Personally my favourite is the OG, but their holiday drink is delicious and there really is something for everyone!",1.0
We are so please to have used Sun City Awing again. This is our second time and it seems like the more we use them the better the company is. Thanks again for another great job in making our backyard look awesome,1.0
"At 930 pm we had a 20 min wait to get in our order, so we were really curious as to finding out what was so special about these ice creams. Don't plan your order beforehand as they do not have all the flavors from their menu. So I ended up taking the toasted coconut ice cream with toasted marshmallow fluff and Reese's. It was delicious. The toasted coconut ice cream was very coconutty and I could taste the shredded coconut through the ice cream. The ambience and outdoor seating reminds me of a college hangout area. It's a simple social setting. Overall a great place minus one because toasted coconut wasn't my first preference and the place did not have all the flavors mentioned in the menu! But a place everyone should visit at least once.",1.0
"Why doesn't this place have more reviews?! The best frozen yogurt in Las Vegas and legit the best one when it comes to customer service! The employees are super sweet and courteous, even when a serial taster like me comes in (I have to always try the new flavors). Usually I tend to try the mango tart with strawberries, but this time opted for just tart with shaved coconut. The best choice I've ever made. Also, try their coffee flavor with butterfingers, it will change your life!",1.0

Huge shout out to Texas Roadhouse grill. Meghan Payan was awesome love the service she gave. Baked  potatoe was awesome steak was to die for some of the best steak ever cooked perfectly  so well season MY GOD!  Our waitress was so knowledge of the product.

"What a gorgeous show. The clowns by far were my favorite!!! Being only my 2nd cirque show, I have started falling in love and can't wait to add more to my memoire. The performers were all stunning as well as the stunts breath taking. The clowns were amazing. All the effects and showmanship were on point and made you sit at the edge of your seat. Did I mention the clowns were amazing Awere hilarious. The gorgeous music, lights, and effects have all played a part to turn this into my new fav cirque performance.",1.0
Loved this place. You walk in and its so dark you can barely see lol. The drinks are strong and the place is cool and you feel like your really in a tiki bar and in Vegas!,1.0
"We make sure to visit Melt every time we visit Cleveland. Even though there are so many delicious grilled cheeses on the menu, I almost always get the chorizo & potatoes which is by far the best thing on the menu. This time I tried the buffalo chicken which was also very good. My mom & cousin had the combo where you got soup, salad and half a sandwich for $9, which is a great value. The buffalo chicken soup was good but crazy spicy. The melt salad was amazing. If you love grilled cheese & haven't been here you have to try it. So good!",1.0
"Good experience was about 15 min late soo they said I had to do the mini package at first I was stand off to this cause I didn't want to pay for 10min but being 33wks I went for it with yelps 20$ for 40$ it cost me nothing out of pocket the coupon did it & the session was still good length.

customer service wise some of the other reviews say they were rude the lady at the desk was enthusiastic & the tech was good she just wasn't one of those personable ultrasound technicians which I'm just fine with she did her job well & tried her hardest to get me a good photo cause my daughter was refusing. With my son I went to babys first image she was very personable but their prices are a bit higher & this time around I wanted to experience HD.",1.0
"It was my first time eating sushi, it was pretty good. The service was great, the ladies were friendly and explained everything well, since it was our first time being there. Waitress was really nice towards my kids. The food was good. It was kinda pricey, but we had 2 kids and 2 adults. The only thing I didn't like was that they charge you $1 to use your debit card and they didn't tell you. I think since my bill was over $100 they could have waived the $1 fee but what can you do. But the sushi was good. I would probably check it out again.",1.0
"Quite possibly the best place to get an affordable lunch in Downtown Pittsburgh. My biggest complaint is that they aren't open in the evenings when we're looking for a quick bite before or after the theater! 

 I've tried a few of their items and LOVE the tabbouleh, kafta, and roasted chicken quarters. The meat grape leaves are a bit inconsistent but always good. I keep intending to try new things at Madonna's but can't help but go back to my favorite things! 

The service is super quick. I would prefer if they could switch to a more eco-friendly container than the styrofoam. I would be willing to pay more for that.",1.0
Got the capastrami. A great mix of sweet and savory. And it was so filling!,1.0
"I brought two of my sisters & my niece here based on reviews on yelp. What a wonderful salon. The decor was beautiful,  the owner & the other nail techs were so nice. They use liners for their foot baths, everything is so clean and sparkly.  At the end they run your feet and legs with hot stones. Absolutely wonderful!!  The price for basic services is comparable to other places I've been to, but they do have a menu of services that go up to $70 for a pedicure. Maybe someday! ! I would highly recommend this place and plan to return again!",1.0
"Excellent food and drink selection. Went for my sisters birthday, the staff (we had Brüno as a server) were very friendly and knowledgeable on everything we inquired about. Food arrived in a timely manner. Atmosphere was very nice on the second floor but it was Friday night and the place downstairs had turned into a very loud semi-club. So if you're looking for a nice upscale place to dine on the weekend I would suggest other options just because it was quite loud and difficult to make conversation over. Otherwise, fantastic.",1.0
"My original review was 5 stars but that was before I really noticed that I had a lot of hairs left behind. I've had both Stephanie and Jordana for Brazilian and full legs. They both do a good job with very minimal pain and are very friendly, however for the price I believe that there should not have been patches of hair that got missed. I probably will return but I will definitely check before leaving.",1.0

"I just ordered from here on some random delivery app I just downloaded because I needed some Thai food in my life ASAP. I am so impressed with this place! Delivery didn't take long maybe 40 minutes, and the delivery man was very nice. We got pad see ew (asked for chicken instead of beef and they got it right!  Yay), pad thai, and Tom yum soup. Everything was literally piping hot I am very impressed. I've gotten dishes at restaurants before that weren't even this hot lol good job guys! We will definitely be ordering from you again very soon! Two thumbs up",1.0
"Look, when you're coming off of a long flight from the east to the west and someone asks if you're hungry-the growling and sounds from your stomach may actually answer the question for you! That's what happened to me recently when I arrived to Phoenix. My colleague promptly drove us to Lo-Lo's after leaving the airport and dammmnnnn!

Let me preface this by saying that I don't usually eat anything fried, but at Lo-Lo's you have to eat something fried if you want to truly immerse yourself in this eating experience. We had appetizers of fried green tomatoes that were deep fried to golden brown while the tomatoes remained juicy and succulent. Then we ventured into the ""Eats"" as they refer to this part of the menu here. I had the redfish with a side of mashed potatoes and greens. GEEZ!

If I'm going to eat this this stuff, then I'm going to EAT THIS STUFF!

But for real-the cornbread. This cornbread here-this cornbread here?! I'm still dreaming about that damn cornbread days later. Carb dreams about that cornbread...

Put it like this, I will not ever come back to Phoenix and not eat at least one meal at this place while there.

Live a little people!!!",1.0
"The food is normally hot, tasty, and filling.  Their green bean fries and bread are amazing.  Seems like a wide range of beer.  I remember once they had blueberry beer.

"Lipshtick is a female comedian series at the Venetian.  Roseanne Barr, Lisa Lapenelli, Whitney Cummings are a few of the comedians they have had so far.  Shows are usually once or twice a month.  We saw Loni Love when we went.  We literally had the worst seats in the house and could see just fine.  If you buy tickets up front there is a meet and greet with the headliner.  The show was hilarious.  There was an opening act that did 15-20 mins and then Loni came out and did about an hour.  Loni killed it and we laughed the entire time.  Like most stand up it is not for the faint at heart or those easily offended.",1.0
Omg so yummy and creamy! My boyfriend and I went twice in one day! Yes Alittle pricey but worth it! Especially that crunchy flakey cookie they put on top. The cookie was sooo good we bought extras. People who give this place low ratings because of the price have no business going to Vegas. If your gonna be a cheapo take your ass to the nearest baskin robins.,1.0
"I wish that I could give this restaurant 5 stars. I really really do. Their food is amazing, their drinks are mind-blowing, their presentation is over the top and awesome! We had one of their hashes and one of their benedicts. Amazing. Watermelon lemonade? Awesome. S'more cappuccino? Thrilled the entire table! Everyone had to have a sip.


Downside... service. Completely overwhelmed. I got a huge biscuit with the hash but no butter or jam. I waited so long for my waitress to come back and check on us my biscuit was stone cold, hard as a rock, and all of us were almost done eating. That says a lot if you understand how HUGE the portions are at this place. I even flagged down another guy and he told me he would get my waitress. She showed up about 10 minutes later and had no clue that I needed anything. Clearly the guy never told her.

 I wanted to order more food, more drinks. They would have made more money! But their sad customer service made us leave, we didn't want to wait there all day for our orders. This is Vegas baby! I have stuff to do today!",1.0
The best chipotle of Pittsburgh. Sometimes the lines are a bit ridiculous but the food is by far superior and consistent to other locations of the same area so I'll gladly wait the extra 5-10 minutes because they can clear a line that's out the door that fast:,1.0
"My favorite koobideh place. So tender and juicy! And the rice is airy and slightly buttered. Highly addicting when combined. This $8.99 dish is a big portion and can last 1-4 meals depending on how you hungry you are or how much you ration it.

Their Mahicheh and Baghali Polo (Lamb Shank with dill\/broad bean rice) is also so good! The lamb shank is fall of the bone tender and the sauce is so flavourful. I'm not a big fan of their dill rice though and prefer the rice that comes with the Koobideh.",1.0

"The TSO experience is like watching two different shows.  I just recently had my first TSO experience on 12\/28\/2015 in Chicago. I can only describe the first half as watching an SNL satirical version of 90's hair bands meets 70's dance moves, complete with flashing images of eyeballs and helicopters and a laser show.  Add this bizarre narrated tale of what I have interpreted to be a teenage runaway trying to get home for Christmas and is hopping in and out of others' dreams. I really had no idea what was going on and could only equate it as this must be what it is like to trip on acid. That aside, the ""rock opera"" music and the singing were outstanding, and with the removal of the story-telling, the second half of the show was astounding.",1.0
First time ever going to a pumpkin patch\/farm. Took my niece and nephews and my 4 month old baby. My niece enjoyed it. My nephews are 6&8 they like the bouncy pad but was like eh but they got so excited when we bought them their pumpkins and went home to carve them. They have decent sizes for kids and at a good price. I would give it 5 stars but we one of the pigs has a broken leg!! I felt so bad for him\/her. My niece felt so sorry for it too. They need to get that pig outta there and to a hospital. We watched it struggle to eat! No kid should ever see ever see that!,1.0

"My daughter and I had the best dining experience at Longhorn. Our waitress Christina was fabulous, our drinks and our food were delicious.

"Came here alone at 1:30am on a Friday night and sat at the counter. I ordered a southwest turkey sandwich and fries. The sandwich was average, and the fries were perfect. The friendly chit-chat between the waiter and the regulars at the counter was amusing enough that I decided to hang out longer while enjoying a slice of hot apple pie topped with whipped cream. The service was excellent! I live close by, so hoping that Jerry's becomes my new late night food stop. Next time, I'll try the breakfast.",1.0

I rated the general yang shrimp and house chow mein the best dishes of the dinner. Now the customer service was exceptional....our waitress was attentive and made us feel welcomed.

The register lady was so polite and cheery and it was like 10pm she had a huge line but was happy to answer my very obvious questions. the food was fast and boy was that whopper amazing... and chicken fries. The place was SUPER CLEAN i than went back and asked for sauces... nobody gave me dirty looks .. the guy bagging the food gave me my sauces smiled and said ""mypleasure"" . Either im used to really crappy service at burger king back home or they really go above and beyond here. After all everyone is exhausted and quite cranky leaving vegas but these people continue to have a smile on their faces. Anyway great experience

"We visited the Museum Tavern last night and had a fantastic time - It was my husband and I's anniversary and I had passed by this place a million times when I was a U of T student, always wanting to try it. 

We were given a nice little corner booth, which allowed us to have an intimate experience. The servers were all very approachable and professional. I had the Aztec Bowl, which was DELICIOUS and a very well-balanced meal. My husband had the Short Rib French Dip, which was one of the best he's ever had. The ambiance is very cozy, and clearly a lot of thought was out into the decor. We kept noticing little accents reminiscent of the 1930's and gave us all kinds of ideas for decorating our own home! 

The only things we were disappointed in were that the service was a tad too slow for our liking. We had to wait a long time for a refresher on our drinks, and for the bill at the end of the night. Given that it's more expensive than your average place, I expect that to be reflected in the service. Also, the Cider selection (if you're a fan, like me) was inadequate. They only had Waupoos, which I find too sweet and light. 

Besides those two small issues, we had a great time and will definitely return! Highly recommend.",1.0
"This is a small restaurant but the food is amazing. Price is also amazing. Since there isn't as many tables if you dine in either come at an earlier time or make reservations, otherwise expect to wait awhile to get a table. But once seated they are super fast at getting the dishes out. 
**They have the best sweet and sour pork I've ever tried!! Yumm",1.0
"Came here for an early summer dinner. With some of the other reviews indicating that the place usually gets busy for dinner service, I was surprised to walk in and see only a few other parties inside (and one party at one of the two outside tables).

Service was really fast and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. For $12 and change, I got their Street Noodle #1 and a glass of lemongrass and honey iced tea. For a quite warm afternoon, the tea is refreshing with just the right amount of honey to not overpower the delicate citrus taste from the lemongrass. Street Noodle #1 is rice noodles and baby boc choy in a chili, fish sauce, and cilantro sauce, all topped with a crispy thai fried chicken cutlet. The sauce was especially tasty and in true Thai cuisine, the spices didn't only contribute heat, but a significant amount of flavor. This time I only got it medium spiciness (level 2 on a scale of 0-5), but next time, I'll definitely go up a notch or two. Also what was surprising is that the sauce tasted like it contains palm sugar, a more richer sweetness than plain sugar. The Thai Fried Chicken was juicy, while preserving a light and crunchy battered crust. The chicken alone is something worth coming to this place for for, even with their stand-out noodles.",1.0
"This has been my favorite hotel. We checked in online in the morning and received a text in the afternoon saying our room was ready. However, the ""Express"" line took longer than the regular line (all the desks were full helping the same groups of people for over 10 minutes when we got there). But it still went really fast and the employee was friendly and clear about all of the charges. Our room was very clean and updated. I liked the shower dispensers (body wash, shampoo, and conditioner), and they have a great hair dryer and vanity mirror. The beds were comfortable, there is a fridge and two water bottles, and the AC worked great. They also made check out really easy by being able to confirm it on your tv and dropping your keys off in a box by the desk or elevator. No line! Cons are that I tried calling 3 times to get a couple more towels. Each time I called, I waited 10 minutes and no one ever answered. We also never found any late night places to eat (after 12am) at this location. Overall, it was a great price and I would love to stay here again.",1.0
"Get the pie. You HAVE to get the pie.
Ordered a lunch special, with a sandwich, coffee and a slice of pie ($10?). Of course, since Rockaberry's is a cafe renowned for their desserts, the pie did not disappoint. Not only was it an enormously huge slice about a quarter of the entire pie, the berry pie was tart, sweet, moist and flakey. The margarita panini with a small side 'salad' was fine, but not exactly memorable. The pie, however, I still crave to this day. I will be back...for more pie. Yum.",1.0

"I haven't written a review in a while, but damn, I gotta say something about Crust.  

Yes, it's true the slices are as big as your head. Such novelty may lead you to believe that this place is all about size (*hey now*). Not true at Crust!  I've quickly become a regular to this pizza\/salad\/sub joint near China Town. The pizza is excellent, sold by both the slice and whole pie. The crust (the best part) is chewy and crispy with a soft center. Melts in your mouth. The toppings are super fresh. No canned mushrooms here! 

The subs are my new fav. They make the bread fresh every day. Same goodness as the pizza. A big pet peeve of mine is biting in to a sub with crusty bread and having the contents spray my lunch mate in the face. Not happening at Crust. The bread is crusty enough to have a good texture, but soft enough to bite through easily. So far, I've tried the Philly, Chicken Parm and Club. All are excellent. 

If you want something sweet, I highly recommend the brownie. It's cake-like, nice and gooey and rich. Leave some room for these babies!

Having said all this, I'm afraid I may have to switch to salads. Otherwise, I won't be able to fit in the door.

"I absolutely LOVE this Chandler location. The staff is so amazing, The design specialists are top notch and visual team is superb.  The store always looks fresh, clean and inviting.  I find the best time to go is in the morning through out  mid day until around 6pm. any day of the week. The ""In store"" designers are there and can pull together any style of vignette you are looking for. Sometimes it is frustrating when something I want is out of stock or can only be purchased online , but again, the staff try their very best to accommodate you the best they can.   I also LOVE the Pottery Barn credit card !! Everyone should have one!  You get 10% back on every purchase and all kinds of fun little perks throughout the year.  I love all Pottery Barns in general, but the Chandler location is my ""go to store"" if I want top notch customer service and attention. I live equal distance between the Scottsdale location and the Chandler location and I always choose Chandler.  The parking is MUCH EASIER to navigate and the store is one level and so easy to move around. You should go!!!  They also have a BATHROOM!! And it is right beside Nordstrom.  Have fun!",1.0

"A little history about my position before meeting Dr D'Souza. The last 2 + years life has been hell for me. My health and Medical issues took over my life. Unless you live it or watch it you will never never understand. Going to Dr's after Dr's. Specialist that put me in more debt running tests and only to tell me there's nothing wrong. I was told I was just fat and to excersize and lose weight. But I forced myself to get through work everyday. I would clock out and my legs would say we're done and I couldn't make it to my truck so I sat at work for a hour or two.  I'd get in the truck and I didn't want to drive because my legs had no strength in them to use the gas and brake pedal. There were days I would get home at 4:15 and sit in the car until my husband would get home at 6 pm to help me out of the car and up the stairs. There's been many days my family had to walk up the stairs behind me as I used the railing to pull myself up the stairs and cried. There where days I'd have to sit on the stairs and go stair to stair on my butt because I couldn't walk down the stairs. I wasn't able to cook or bake. Hell even showering was painful. I literally lived like those episodes of my 400 pound life. I would come home go upstairs and go right to bed. I would be in bed while listening to my family living life downstairs. I would eat dinner in my bed. I could NOT walk. I would literally live in my bed. I used to go to my primary Dr's and tell him if I ever die of a overdose know it wasn't suicide. I would take pain pills just to sleep 3 to 4 hours at night. The pain was uncontrollable. Now I may only take 2 IB Profen PM's a night if need be. My husband used to rub my feet every night and I'd cry because it hurt but it would help. I'd rarely call out of work even though the pain was out of control. Only time I'd call out was when I couldn't walk. I was in such a depression and was looking into funeral stuff because I swore I was dying. The day I opened up to a co worker and that was the day my life changed forever. I met Davis who did my ultrasound. What a amazing guy !!!! Listened to me cry like a baby and even doing the ultrasound was horrifically painful. He asked me if I needed to take a break, I told him let's just get this overwith. All I wanted was answers. The next week I met Randy. He also is amazing. They both listened, gave you piece of mind that you're not crazy like you felt by previous Dr's. Then Dr D'Souza walked in the room, that's the day my life was going to change for good. That day I walked out of the office I was on cloud 9. To finally hear that there's a reason I'm feeling this way and there's a solution was a emotional time for me. So in a week I start my proceedures. The first one wasn't bad. The second one was tougher but nothing compared to the pain i was living with every day. The last two were cake walks. And then onto leg #2. After the very first surgery I could feel the difference already. I didn't miss one day of work for my surgerys. Dr D'Souza puts on music and sings lol. I enjoyed listening to him sing it lightens up the mood and anxiety. Yesterday when he came in I told him I was requesting Christmas music. Lol sure as heck he fulfilled my request. Nothing like having a Dr working to make you better and listening to him sing Frosty the Snowman. I have been able to bake and cook again. So now I bake for them. I am able to be down stairs with my family and starting to be able to start living life again. I had talked to my assistant manager before my first meeting with Dr D'Souza and told him I may need to step down. I love my Department and my associates, but honestly did not know how I was going to be able to stay working. But thanks to Dr D'Souza and his staff for giving me my life back. I had just about given up after years of being told it was in my head, I didn't know what to do.  It was a blessing to find Dr D'Souza and I will be forever greatful. They aren't just a Dr's office but the whole staff is now part of my family. I cry just talking about this. They explain before you even go into surgery the healing process depends on your body. I still have pain and days it sucks but that's because it didn't happen overnight and it wont be fixed overnight, I am on my feet all day at work and doing stairs, so my body lets me feel that. But once I'm 100% healed my life is going to be amazing. I take it one day at a time. You can't damage your body for years, in my case this issue has been going on for about 11 years without me knowing,  then expect it to be overnight. I highly recommend Dr D'Souza. To date I have had 13 surgeries, I have no regrets and can't wait to be 100% healed. They can't make my body heal any quicker than I can. Its all up to my body now to do the rest, If you follow the rules they give you it will happen.  I have NEVER EVER had billing issues with them. And when they say they will do something, They will !!!! Their Staffing is AMAZING !!!!!!!",1.0
"I was looking to buy turtles in the Markham area. The store was surprisingly bigger then I thought. Has a huge selection of saltwater and freshwater fish. The workers there seems very knowledgeable and gave good advice on which products to buy.

The turtles were 3 for $40 or 1 for $15. I was actually at Market Village 2nd floor pet store before coming to this store. The turtles at Market Village was not active and all of them were sleeping.

Also, the have 5 different soups, several pasta choices, and Dessert!!  Yea! Take that, diet! You can feel virtuous and full at the same time, while bragging to your friends "" I had salad for lunch.",1.0
Today was my 1st time going to PDQ and I must say it was amazing! Great customer service. Everyone was very tentative of us the restaurant was very clean and my kids loved the chicken strip. I would recommend this place to everyone,1.0
"Target is Target, nothing more or less I suppose. They have basically all that you could need from clothes to food and even stretching to some areas like electronics and housewares. I really didn't expect this location to be any different then the ones I normally visit where I live.

Unusually, I saw plenty of empty shelves throughout all of the general housewares and electronic areas, mostly in the compact discs. I'm not sure if this is normal considering I arrived at around ten in the morning but It seemed pretty sparse in contrast to the amount of customers in the store. However, the staff here were very friendly and offered friendly smiles even when they were busy stocking merchandise.

As such, for those in the Strongsville area, this is a great place to shop at when you just need a little of everything. It's a step above the traditional Wal-Mart and is at least guaranteed to make you leave with something in hand...they even have a Pizza Hut near the entrance!",1.0
Authentic Greek food made by Greeks. You can tell the quality of ingredients. Best Tzatziki sauce and the best falafel I have ever tasted. They said it is because they form the balls per order; they are never frozen. The $10.99 combo gives you enough food for 2 meals. Most gyro meat I have ever seen on a sandwich. Excellent dolmas; 6 came with my side choice for the combo. Will come back again whenever I am craving Greek food.,1.0
"Simply amazing. It's like a variety show, not a story like some shows. It was amazing, totally awesome just like out of this world. They are world class performers better than Olympic performers. I was in awe the entire time. Loved it. Would Rec, would take visitors from out of town (I live here) and will go again.",1.0
This place is really awesome when you are wanting to go to a club for hip hop. Pretty large dance floor. Line is pretty easy when you have the right people with you. Guest list is easy for girls. Great place to dance all night. They have guest performers all the time. Come here and shake it!,1.0

"It all begins with quality customer service and the let me just say that Nicole, Matt and Yvette at the Leasing Office are among the very best! I recently went on a trip and was concerned about the welfare of my plants. I called the office for watering suggestions and Nicole immediately offered to do it herself along with her staff! That is just one example of countless times she has been there. Not to mention her genuine compassion and interest that I am satisfied with my community.

"Not the best lobster roll I've had but still pretty good. Lobster on the classic roll was fresh and full of flavor. Bread was fresh with a good texture. And the fries were crisp and tasty. Only knock was the price-it's Vegas but still, as somebody who knows what the same would sell for in New England I'm still getting over the sticker shock.  

But definitely worth a visit if you have a hankering for lobster on the strip",1.0
"An amazing visit! I came in about fifteen minutes before closing and despite this, the technicians were extremely kind, attentive, and accommodating. My shellac polish change was about as precise as it gets, and despite it being so late in the day, I wasn't made to feel burdensome or in a rush whatsoever. Much appreciated given that I've lived in the area for quite a while and find that you often have to choose between quality and service when it comes to nail salons. Thank you again! :)",1.0

"When I first moved to Vegas, my family and I stayed here a lot while we were looking for a house to buy. We loved the Hilton cause it was off the strip and away from the partying. 

At this point, when you're looking for a house, you spend so much time looking at houses during the day, and when that's in the famous desert heat of Vegas, you just want to crash and \/ or relax the evening away.

We had 2 adjoining suites. Both suites had a couch & 2 chairs surrounding a coffee table, a long desk spanning the length of the window, bed area, and the bathrooms had 2 sinks, a tub & a separate shower. I was able to snag a very good rate that was easy to pay when it came time to pay my bill. 

We ordered a lot of room service, which was very reasonably priced. Waiters top notch. There also is a little store in the lobby level downstairs that has practically anything you'd need or want, including very good but plain PB&J, chicken salad & tuna salad sandwiches for cheap. 
 
I used the business center quite a bit, and I found everyone who worked in that department to be very helpful, friendly & fair in prices for faxing documents, using the computer, etc. 

Also, there are many shops there, where I found some really gorgeous clothes and shoes (heels & flats). I actually spent a lot of time at this hotel, and I have to say that everything was always top-notch.

Very few people know this, but some very famous people live here (on the higher floors you can't get to, so don't even try).

Tip:  There are secret side elevators at the end of some of the very long halls leading from your room, making for a slick way to descend from your room to the lobby in a jiffy ;)",1.0
"I unfortunately had to go through the hassle of renting a car because I had to bring my car into the body shop. This location made a hassle actually very pleasant. I was slightly disappointed that they didn't have any cars available when I came in without a reservation, but I forgot that reservations usually help. I had to wait an hour because all of the cars were oil changed abs washed, didn't mind I had breakfast down the street. Because of the wait, they gave me a courtesy upgrade.

"A simple shop serving gelato and sweet drinks. There are many options for gelato flavors (around 15). The employees kindly let you try free samples of the flavours, though one employee I encountered looked super bored and disgruntled.

The gelato tastes fine according to my expectation, nothing special to say (whether good or bad). It's nice that the shop serves free water to balance out the sweetness.

The interior decor is unfortunate. The menu signage looks ugly. The interior is a drab white, and a lot of floor space is left open with no tables or anything.

Myself and my sis drove down to this place which was very close to our hotel in Vegas.  It was little hard to find this place since the lights from the strip club beside cover up the place mostly. I liked the ambiance very much and the place isn't very crowded usually at 7ish. Liked the free chips they served along with 3 different varities of salsa as starters and used a coupon from yelp to claim a free margarita. The burrito was huge and served 2 people sufficiently. I am sure this place is one of the good places to eat mexican food while in Vegas.,1.0
"Almost a 5. Great decor and ambiance paired with a great selection of brunch items and innovative twists on breakfast staples.
The pancakes may even make it on the letter home. Fluffy stack of hot cakes with a decadent berry coulis and whipped cream.
The grilled cheese is heaven and if you pair them with the Rosemary potatoes you have a winning combo.
Servers are super accommodating and friendly.

"Our little girls (6 and 8) love hibachi. It is their favorite dinner request. We eat sushi or hibachi at least once or twice a month so we were excited when we heard about Ohjah. The atmosphere is fun and exciting. The staff is extremely attentive and quick with any request. I would recommend this restaurant just for the service. 

Now on to the food. All of us ordered the hibachi with the starter (soup and salad). It was delicious. The girls offered off the kids menu and we ordered off the adult menu. The portions and price are perfect for our family. Reasonable for the amount of fun that we had and the food was delicious.

All barbers are dressed with business attire and dress shoes.",1.0
"Been here 3-4 times and they never disappoint. food is made fresh how you order it everytime and have never had a bad experience with the food here. There are 2 things that keep it from getting a perfect 5 stars. First, I personally prefer soft shell tacos to hard shells, and you can only get hard shells here. They taste fine, but I would like the option. Secondly, this place needs its own way to place an order online. My office would probably eat here everyday as it is so close, but few people in a call center can take time off to place an order. Even accepting orders through Facebook, even Email or something would be sufficient for a small place like this! Until then, once or twice a month is the max my co-workers and I can handle. Great food, just a hassle ordering.",1.0

The other times I got the carnitas burrito. Now this was really good. The meat was flavorful and plentiful. I like how they didn't stuff the burrito with beans and rice. That way you could really taste the meat. This has made me end my trips to Roberto's. I was also craving beans, just not in my burrito, so I got a side of it. It was good and flavorful. The restaurant is a tiny place in with a few tables and kind of way out there. I was sort of in the area so no problemo!",1.0

Color - Love it! I was terrified of dying my naturally black hair. Had been mulling it over for years. Literally. Anissa had great ideas for what I could try and then after patiently explaining the whole process to me, executed those ideas beautifully.  Excited to go back in a couple months to go even lighter ... :)",1.0
"I decided to go with the yellow curry so I could compare to other thai places. While I enjoyed it, I felt that I liked Thai Rama's better. I know, blasphemy to the Yupha's faithful.

It was a touch less spicy than Rama, which could be better or worse depending on who you are. It seems like other reviewers have reported slightly more mild flavors too, so there may be something to that. They also served far less rice than Rama. While they will bring you more rice... Rama will bring you a large bowl and repeatedly ask if you want more. Total rice in the original bowl was about 1 cup. Which maybe I don't know how to properly eat thai, but that is far enough for a whole meal of curry.

I also got the crab puffs, which were freaking awesome.

I went with a vegetarian and they felt that their options were limited. If you are a vegetarian and don't want tofu (like my company) then you can ask for more vegetables in place of the tofu if you want.

I'd go back here no problem. I liked it.

Had a green juice for the first time not too long ago. I believe the owner was the guy who was working? Very nice man. Prices however aren't very reasonable. I paid I believe close to $8 for a juice that is a standard green juice at other juice bars. I thought I ordered a large but the cup I got was more like a medium or standard size? The way the prices go up aren't very fair bc you only get 3 choices of fruits and veggies which aren't very many...then you add an additional .99 for the extras. I also didn't like how you had to go to their website to see their other menu? Not very convenient for customers that are on the go.  Juice was good though but price was just too high...,1.0

I'm always skeptical about going to Mexican places. Most of the times I leave disappointed. I ordered the torta ahogada de buche. Let me start off by saying the the salsa they put on it was on point not to thick with a good kick. The bread was soft and moist. It didn't get soggy even though it had the sauce on it. The bouche was delicious properly seasoned and cooked well. The flavor for the price is unbeatable.,1.0
Theresa does my nails.  She is a master at her craft.  My nails come out perfect every time.  I'm really picky and want my nails thin and natural.

"If MJ was performing live, it probably could have been five stars, but they get a solid four because of the great tribute. I thought I would see some amazing MJ dance moves, but I guess I expected to much for 150 dollars a pop. With that being said I enjoyed the show although a bit loud, the aerobics were amazing, the glove rolling around stage was a cute touch. My favorite part of show was the neon lit suits and dancers up in the air and on sides of walls, pretty cool. The staff was great, the paparazzi was funny, and I love the overall decor. There is a gift shop with all kinds of cute stuff to purchase. I would suggest the 2nd section of the auditorium to sit in, so you can get the entire presentation of the huge stage show.

Hands down, you must get the fresh oysters and pan roast! The oysters were huge! A lot bigger than expected which explains why we ordered two dozens and couldn't even finish. They are very generous with their portions so order wisely. The drinks were good too. My dirty martini was made right and my friend's Bloody Mary had a perfect amount of spice.

The main bar has nothing wrong with it although having another one or two real ales on would suit me personally but the rooms at the back afford the whole place an extra dimension. The brass tabletops are well maintained and polished and the room we occupied for a while last night has its own tv so would be an ideal spot for a group to congregate to catch match coverage.

"I can't get enough of this place.  We go here a couple times a week.  I like the sausage and onion pizza and we also get a salad.  There are three salads I really like: feta and turkey, the apple one, and the caprese.  My husband and I share a pizza and a salad.  There is more than enough food for each of us and the food is pretty inexpensive.  Staff is friendly, although you order at a counter and someone brings out your food.  Aside from that you don't have much interaction with a waiter as you would at a traditional sit down restaurant.",1.0
I have been frequenting Viva Mercados since they were a tiny hole in the wall on Jones. We absolutely love the barbacoa and usually don't deviate from deliciousness!  9 years ago we moved to Henderson but make the 45 minute trek across town as it is so worth the drive. Take out of town visitors there whenever we can.,1.0
"This is a small hole in the wall place with no decor, cheap tables, cheap chairs, one server, and they serve you food with plastic utensils. You don't come here for atmosphere or service or for an ""authentic"" dining experience but you do come here for Asian comfort food and Big Wongs cheap cheap prices. 

I think everything on their menu is 10 dollars or less. They have preserved egg and salted pork congee for 4 bucks, lots of chicken and pork dishes for 5, and sliced ribeye and seafood dishes for 10. Their portions are huge!  I ordered the deep fried pork and it came in two plates!  Pork was crispy and delicious. The egg that was served was cook Japanese style where it's soft boiled so the yolk is still creamy on the inside.  My friend ordered the hai nam chicken. Again huge portions. I think she got at least 1\/4 of a chicken. I love the sauces that come with this dish and the garlicky rice is sooo satisfying. 

This place accepts credit cards too, which is hard to find at places when the total bill comes out to be $10. Will definitely come back for good cheap food. The guy who served is was also very nice and refilled our water cups without even asking. :)",1.0

"what a great wax! I've been getting brazilians for years at a variety of salons, and this was definitely one of the better experiences I've had. the service was professional and upscale. not too much ""pampering"" or soft lighting in the waxing room like more expensive salons but it was surgically clean, organized and very comfortable. my waxing technician was young but she knew exactly what she was doing - no awkwardness! I was SO happy to learn that they only use hard wax, much better for sensitive skin like mine. the whole thing was over in less than 15 minutes & afterwards the technician applied some soothing product. I appreciated that she mentioned their product line, but didn't try to force me to buy anything.

because I was a first time customer, my wax was half off - only $23! plus I looked at their packages and they offer some great deals.

I played in a group of 4 people, and felt the adventure had a very good balance of difficulty and discovery. Though there were a few places we got stuck on, we were still able to progress with the increasing amount of clues we were able to find. All four of us were very engrossed into the experience, and had good teamwork even though we (two groups of two) didn't know each other before hand. There were some neat surprises and some satisfying aha moments. I won't spoil them, but if you like puzzles you'll definitely love this place!

"I made the trip to this location as when conducting a Google search for floor mirrors, Rona was one of the places that popped up. A $95 mirror marked down to $45. 
Got to the store and found the area where they were, but it still had the $95 price on it. I waved down an employee and asked him the price. He took the universal code and wandered off, returning in about a minute with the answer I wanted. They were indeed on sale for $45.
Got them to the cashier and it rang it at $22.50 (half of the $45 price point). I mentioned to the cashier that the floor salesman I spoke to said they were on sale for $45, but she scanned it again and it still came in at $22.50. She then called a manager over who said the item was clearance and the weekend I picked it up, there was an additional 20% off...so tax in, my $95 mirror cost me $22. I felt like that IKEA commercial....""Start the car....start the car !!!"" 
Went back a few days later to pick up a french door....also on sale.  Great value! I didn't interact with any employees on the floor on that visit...just found the right size and walked to the front of the store.

"Nice uptown Izakaya. This may be my new Izakaya go-to uptown, although I'm not sure if they can replace my don don. 

My only complaint is that it was a bit dark in there even during day time and they kept playing with the lights. The music was a bit loud I couldn't even hear the person across from me. The food was decent, my Izakaya favs\/standard bars are salmon warayaki and takoyaki. The salmon warayaki was flavourful, full of smoky aromas, on the pricey side. Combined with a pinch of sea salt it was good texture and taste overall. The takoyakis were nice and small, I like it better than bigger ones that just have more air inside. The piece of octopus inside was then proportionally bigger. There was lots of fish shavings on top and decent amount of mayo and okonomiyaki sauce. Each bite had a good proportion of octopus, warm potato mash and sauce. Since there was only two of us we only tried two other things. Cheese Buldak: hot BBQ chicken with cheese, basically pieces of grilled chicken with hot Korean sauce topped with melted cheese. This dish was okay for me, I don't do so spicy. It wasn't too flavourful and the cheese didn't complement for some reason, I've had better. Also had the Tonkatsu Tamago Toji, fried pork chop with egg in broth. This was interesting to soak the Tonkatsu in broth and went well w the egg. Seems like a pork chop rice without the rice.

"Stopped at Tryst on a club crawl. Given it's at the Wynn it is a pretty luxurious place in a more intimate sense. Given I was on Sin City Club Crawls I bypassed the massive line full of the elite in Vegas so cannot comment on the wait (which I imagine was long by the dirty looks we got passing them by) nor the cost. The club is almost solid red in the inside and has an outdoor portion with bottle service seating and a waterfall. That brings me to the one star deduction, the club is very much dedicated to bottle service. I was there early in the evening so was able to lean on the edges of empty tables, but I am not sure if this would fly when the tables are full. The dance floor is small, but the whole club is small so that's not much of a surprise. The music seemed to be top40 and was a decent DJ. You won't see Tiesto or Steve Aoki here but it's still a good time.

I have done a bit of research and it looks like the have some great bottle pricing where you could probably get a table for less than $1000 after all the hidden fees. I plan on going to Tryst during my next visit and if my GF likes it enough I may consider finding out how to get a bottle or two and hanging out longer. 

Overall, it is a good club. Not a big glamorous club like Drais or better yet Omnia, but it is definitely high class and a good time. May not be my top recommendation, but if the bottle prices are as good as I read online then it seems like a great option for a bachelor\/ette parties or couples or a couple guys that had a good night at the slots. Not a must see, but a good time if you end up there.",1.0

She explained what she was doing and was very understanding of my wants and needs. After 20-25 mins, I was done. She applied a cooling aloe gel\/ointment so there wouldn't be any redness after waxing. She also filled my brows with powder\/wax and used concealer to hide any red areas from post-wax. The end result was great. She even offered a complimentary lip colour, but I already had on lipstick.

Although there were some delays in communication, I was also appreciative that the store was willing to rush-order a particular item that I planned to give as a gift.

"I visited on the recommendation of a friend.  I was very impressed.  When I first heard of this place I figured it was just another burger spot jumping on the bandwagon with average burgers.  Charlotte rewards safe, chain like, average food establishments, and I thought that's what I would experience.  This is not the case.  It's a small, counter service, gourmet burger joint.  The food is presented very nicely, but it's the quality that really matters.  A friend and I tried two different burgers and a couple different sides.  Everything was clearly hand crafted and the additional care they take in the kitchen came through in the taste.  This is better than bad daddy's and better than five guys, and currently rates as my top burger in Charlotte.  Any foodie needs to visit and check this place off their list, it's worth it.

"Barolo is such a wonderful addition to this area of E Washington. Parking is easy and available along the street out front, and it's far enough away from the busyness of Capitol Square to be considered a more intimate venue for wine and cocktail sipping. 

The outdoor patio adorned with plants and lights is also a wonderful place to enjoy a glass of wine. 

Barolo is aiming to be one step above many ""wine bar"" establishments popping up as of late, and they succeed (in my book). The vino list is eclectic and well-curated, and after a brief glance at the food offerings I was quite impressed with what they have put together. Upon chatting with the friendly and knowledgable bartender, he divulged that the entire concept of the leased space is divided into separate entities offering specific amenities in a convenient manner. The farthest tenant to the back is a southern-inspired restaurant, then there is Barolo, and then a coffee shop closest to the entrance (which was yet un-opened on our visit). I thought it a clever arrangement of establishments, and wish the minds behind the idea all the best with their endeavors.

"The decor is a bit of mish-mash, and the food lacks ANY sort of the culinary aesthetic people have started to expect in Toronto restaurants. I mean, both the nachos and the burger looked EXACTLY like something I could (and have) made at home.

But, you know what? I make GREAT nachos and grill an EXCELLENT burger at home. So how could I complain about these ones? And looks\/presentation aside, there was certainly no lack of quality for either item. The nachos were a decent size and not at all hurting for cheese,  the burger tasted great, and even the fries (something I couldn't make at home) were thick and tasty. I got a bit of a diner feel from everything, but with a fraction of the grease you'd usually see.

So maybe you're thinking, ""Great. But why would I pay restaurant prices for something I could get at home?""  Yeah, no. This MAY be the last bastion of sane restaurant prices in Toronto. I'm not kidding when I say the meals were half, nearly a third, of what I actually expected to pay. And even a pitcher (of any of their very respectable selection) of beers for $14.50 isn't bad. Yes, they were on a nightly special, but even their menu prices surprised me.

I love both of those ""mish-mashed"" ambiances I mentioned earlier, so what's wrong with seeing them both in one space? It was the funky, string-light, randomly decorated front that drew me in, and the surprisingly stylish, conventionally decorated rear of the restaurant where I ended up sitting.  They even had some kind-of-hilarious, conversation-creating art hung up back there.

All in all, if you're looking for a polished dining experience, maybe don't go here. If you're looking for a pretty great ambiance, some respectable food, and to re-live the nostalgia of mid-90s food prices, this is probably a must-see...",1.0

"I learned how to make crane origamis here, which led to a memorable birthday gift of a thousand cranes. Their paper collection, rich knowledge of origamis, love of customer service, and warm hospitality makes this store a great find in Montreal.

"Located in the, well, grand Grand Concourse building, right next to the restaurant, Gandy Dancer puts on a killer Happy Hour every weeknight.  There are drink as well as food specials.  My husband and I stopped by on Friday the 13th prior to our Grand Concourse dinner reservations next door, and what a great decision that was!  As can be expected, the $5 glasses of wine during Happy Hour were more than twice the price in the restaurant.

We gobbled up an order of the craft beer battered cod (light and flakey and served with thick rich tartar sauce; couldn't have been better), the raw oysters (all 3 were nice and mild, just the way I like them), and the white flatbread (a nice cracker-thin crust).  That, a few glasses of wine, and we were off to our dinner reservations next door.  I have to say, all things considered and bang for buck, Gandy Dancer stands right up to Grand Concourse.

Service was great, efficient.  We snagged the last open table in the jovial bar area, and our server was on top of everything.  The food and refills came out quickly despite Happy Hour being in full swing.",1.0

Ma principale réserve est le menu assez convenu, surtout pour le déjeuner. Pas mauvais, plutôt ""plate"" -- pour quelqu'un comme moi qui aime manger au resto  quelque chose de différent par rapport à la maison. C'est néanmoins un excellent endroit pour venir travailler (wifi gratuit), manger en groupe ou en famille, ou prendre un café avec un bon livre ou un journal, dans un quartier très agréable à arpenter.

 I just found Authentic Ethio on Grubhub, and had to call to confirm that they delivered because I just didn't believe it! Haha. As a vegan with no car, you get pretty sick of the same two delivery options (zpizza or Siu Wok) month after month, so I was just ecstatic and in disbelief that authentic Ethiopian food was truly going to arrive at my door! The owner answered and was such a pleasant person to talk to. So helpful, informative, and genuinely sounded happy to be doing this. .

So...I pretty much wanted to try everything that I could get my gluttonous veggie hands on. I ordered a 3 side and 4 side combo to share with my boyfriend (who is quite the picky eater). The owner said it would be about $21 with the delivery fee, and I thought that was incredibly reasonable for the beast amount of food I ordered, lol.  He also informed me it would take about an hour, and I was more than happy to wait for this glorious bounty. He was at my door in almost exactly that time! I hand him my cash and he hands me the goods, and man, it had some girth too it. I knew I was getting bang for my buck. So, I get inside, open up the containers, and marvel at the beautiful feast I'm about to take part in. 

IT WAS ALL SO VERY DELICIOUS! Each container was lined with injera bread, and then the separate dishes were placed in compartments on top of the bread. The split lentil and split peas were so freaking flavorful and the star and co-star of the meal. There was also a beet and potato dish, (I love beets, and they were cooked perfectly), a string bean dish (yummy with the lentils), a stewed cabbage side (was great for adding texture to every bite, plus I just like cabbage), and slow-cooked chopped collards (slightly bitter, but in that good way that collards are!). All of it just went so well together and now I'm obsessed and hope this place sticks around for the rest of my days on this earth! 

Btw! My boyfriend, who is neither vegan, nor a connoisseur of other cultures foods, actually really enjoyed the split lentils and split peas with the injera bread and ate about half of the serving. That's really saying something because his diet consists of burgers, carne asada burritos, and jimmy john's ham and provolone subs. No joke. He rarely strays!

Honestly I'd rather spend the extra $1.50 and take my money to cold stone. Dairy Queen quality is just so low budget tasting to me. You can't go from eating cold stone on the regular to transitioning to Dairy Queen! Back paddling much? Hey but in all fairness the ice cream was good for what it was worth and it's close to my house so I suppose when I'm feeling lazy this can be a back up to help cure those late night ice cream cravings! They seem to always be having a bunch of deals going on with the food there! The staff is all young here so don't expect completely professional service because everybody was texting and probably taking selfies while I was waiting to place my order in the drive thru..,1.0
Great atmosphere! Their mango tango margarita was delicious! Staff was nice. Food was great. I didn't make it on time for their happy hour when I was in town this time.

"Guys, I think I'm addicted to the crinkly fries here at Shake Shack. With that confession out of the way, I must say I can totally understand what the hype about this place is, whereas I couldn't understand why people love In-and-Out so much. (separate review)

Within my 6 day stay in Vegas, I had two meals at Shake Shack. During the first visit, I tried the Shack Attack - It satisfied every craving at 1AM after just getting off the plane. The condiments table was surprisingly clean and organized, there was no mess to be seen as opposed to other fast food chains. 

My second visit was a bit underwhelming, which was why I did not rate them a 5 star. This is because I tried their hot dog instead of sticking with the burger. I think I had a better hot dog from a street vendor... but the crinkly fries kept me satisfied! 

I hope they expand to Canada one day!",1.0

We had breakfast this morning and the service was really good. I had the chicken fried chicken, eggs, toast and sweet potato tots.
Lana had steak and eggs. Everything was prepared promptly and fresh. Only slight drawback was the breading on my chicken fried chicken was a little overly salty and Lana said her steak lacked seasoning, so one item over salted and one item under seasoned, but still a great place for breakfast. We've dined here many times when it was Timbers and it was good and now as Village Pub it's even better. The fish and chips are a standard and the BBQ Ribs is something we'll try sometime soon.
Kind of an out of the way location, but try it out. It's never over crowded and the service is very good.
The man today in the black Chef's coat, Jon was a great host! He really cared about your comfort and was always checking on us.
Check out the specials on the blackboard it has some great values. Also happy hour 11pm to 3 am and 3pm to 6pm daily. Prices are great, but the happy hour prices makes it even better.

I love veggies, and I've never had fresher, more perfectly cooked veggies in all of Charlotte.  The wait staff is extremely knowledgeable, helpful and patient with those of us that aren't very familiar with vietnamese, and they do a wonderful job explaining things and offering alternatives.

I had the Spicy Thai Style Beef Salad. My salad was big and tasty. It didn't remind me of Thai Food but it tasted good and the beef was tender. I thought it was a pretty good salad and I think it ran about $7.99?

After 3 visits in 2 months with groups, this is one of those places where just about everything is excellent. It's fine to go alone or for 2, but IMHO it's pretty ideal if you want to eat family style, and that way of course you get to sample more of the delicious food. The duck panang and Moo Khum Waan are favorites of mine, but if you're not that familiar with Thai food beyond pad Thai, don't be afraid to branch out. The staff is super helpful about answering questions and adjusting spice level preferences.

It's an insanely good value considering how excellent the food, service and ambiance are. I've been to Lotus and like it there too, but I'd have to say Chada is even better.

I kept seeing friends post pictures on facebook and IG from here so I had to try it out! I got a pot of tea and a slice of red velvet crepe cake. Tea was tea, lol. The price wasn't too bad, but for a bag of tea it could be better. I'd say try one of their other specialty drinks, you'll get more of a bang for your buck! The red velvet crepe cake was alright. It didn't really taste much like red velvet at all, but it was light and fluffy. So I still enjoyed it!

"I have been to Scottsdale many times over a period of 16 years, and I live in the NYC area. As such, my standards are very high, and many times I was disappointed by what many said were ""good"" restaurants in Scottsdale.

First, the Negroni is the best I ever had. I have had Negroni in the SoHo House, Mas Farmhouse, Four Seasons Restaurant, and Le Cirque in Manhattan and Florence, Italy, which is the birthplace of the Negroni, and Citizen Public House beats them all. What did they do better? They aged the drink in barrels. It was the smoothest Negroni I ever had. The pork belly was THE best I ever had. It was not fatty and no gristle. The chopped salad was spectacular. The lamb burger was amazing - flavor bursted in my mouth with each bite.

Wouldn't go out of my way to get it again but if you want real BBQ in Vegas this is probably your best bet and directly behind Strip.,1.0
"This is an uber cool event! We bought our tickets online and so visited will call after the free shuttle ride (parking was also free at Edgewater Park). We were excited to try the Steady Rollin Session IPA (brewed for this event)- my IPA lovin' husband gave it two enthusiastic thumbs up. There were plenty of food options (we picked the Beachcomber) and plenty of places to stand and eat. They gave us compostable silverware and cups, and there were a lot of available receptacles which kept it nice and clean. In the boat house there were food demonstrations, but we missed those as we spent most of our time outside enjoying the sights and music.  I'm guessing there were at least 35 porta potties in a very well-lit area behind the light house. The live music was great! We especially liked Hey Mavis (local Kent band!). We will definitely go back next year- it is great to see these Cleveland revitalization efforts underway. We love this city! 5 stars for the event planners and for this great event!",1.0

"This is a great locally owned and operated bakery & espresso bar.  The owner is incredibly friendly, as well as passionate about what she's doing.  Stocked with an amazing bakery (try a sample!) and tasty organic coffees from fair trade, organic, US sources.  They even have a promise posted on the wall that they will strive to provide products with no artificial flavors, GMOs, preservatives, or hydrogenated oils.  So great to see businesses catering to this in the Henderson\/Vegas area.

I had an incredibly smooth latte served up in a compostable Eco cup.  I also sampled a vegan coconut cupcake which was moist and had the perfect amount of sweetness.  I didn't realize it was vegan until I went over to the case to see what deliciousness I had sampled.

The decor is minimal and very American Country, it felt cozy. I ordered chicken fried chicken and my boyfriend got an omelette. The staff was completely on their game. My drink was never empty and the minute I pushed my salad plate aside it was picked up. The food was just perfect. I felt like I was eating at someone's southern grandmothers house. It was fresh and homemade tasting. I know that sounds odd but it's true. Like they made everything from scratch the minute I ordered it, no frozen or cheap leftover flavor that most restaurants have. You must try this place!",1.0

"The Vandal, one of the many restaurants that opened up in Pittsburgh this summer. I am happy that Pittsburgh's food scene is growing quickly. Each restaurant seems to have their own unique place, increasing the diversity of food choices. The Vandal provides interesting hamburgers and sandwiches. Overall, I thought the food was pretty good, but I wasn't completely blown away.

The service was fantastic. Everyone was sweet and helpful. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the place.

We got the pork sandwich, chicken sandwich, fries, and hibiscus lemonade.

The pork sandwich was okay. The bread was a little chewy, but the flavors were great. The chicken was good. I liked the sweetness of the slaw, which complimented with the spiced chicken. The chicken itself was flavorful and crispy, although some parts of it were a little dry. Overall, the chicken sandwich was definitely the better of the two and the flavors were fantastic, I can see myself coming back for just that.

My only big issue with the place was the hibiscus lemonade. The ice in the drink had that weird savory flavor you get when you have ice in the freezer for too long. As the ice started to melt, it completely ruined our drink.

For the price, I thought it was pretty reasonable for the sandwiches. However, the side salads are pretty small for $5. While not the best chicken sandwich in Pittsburgh, it is a unique one and I see myself coming back sometimes.",1.0

Get in line about 30-40 minutes before doors open. Mind the signs because if you are in the wrong line, you will be ridiculed!  (The show started outside while we were waiting. Too funny!) 

Listen closely to what the menu options are and how the food is prepared.  They won't repeat it without making fun of you for your lack of attention or being hard of hearing. (The meal consists of a tossed salad, which awaits you at the table, the main course of beef, chicken or pasta, and a dessert of, I believe it was ice cream with chocolate sauce.) 

If you purchased a VIP or RIP package, you will have liquor drink ticket(s). Make sure to use them, otherwise you lose out on a drink you paid for! Give it to the alchy sitting next to or across from you!

"After a couple visits, I think Watan Kabob has become my go-to for Afghan food. 

The food is always fresh, the portions are big, and the prices are reasonable. 

I have tried the Tandoori Kabob, Chicken Breast Kabob, and Chaplee Kabob. My favourite is definitely the Tandoori Kabob. The chicken was juicy and flavourful, with a bit of a kick. The chicken breast is good if you aren't looking for something spicy. As for the Chaplee Kabob, it was my first time trying this dish. I liked the marinade and the meat was cooked perfectly, but it was quite oily...

The salad is always fresh and I love the Afghani bread (especially dipped in both the sauces). For about $2 more, you can get a dinner platter which comes with quite a bit of basmati rice. 

Watan Kabob has a fairly straightforward ordering system. You just have to order and pay at the counter, then wait until your number is called. 

It can be quite busy, even on a weeknight, packed with families and children playing hide-and-seek behind you. 

Watan Kabob is very similar to Bamiyan Kabob (I read in an earlier review that the owner of Watan Kabob used to work there). However, it differs from a restaurant with waiter service, an extensive menu, and more comfortable seating, like Paramount. Unfortunately, Watan Kabob does not make the thick garlic sauce that Paramount offers, but I enjoyed the food at Watan Kabob more and the menu is more reasonably priced. The only reason I would return to Paramount is for their appetizers, manakeesh, and baklawa.",1.0

"I was shocked to discover that after years of living in the neighbourhood, I had never been to this amazing Mexican delicacy of a spot. Not only is there a lovely patio overlooking St Clair West, but the food is authentic, fresh, and yummy, and there is plenty of beer to go with your tacos! 

I was greeted by a friendly woman behind the counter who informed me that the recipes are authentic Mexican and the meat is hormone-free. That is pretty amazing given the low price point. They also make their own corn tortillas as well as offering a variety of alternatives (whole wheat, white flour, etc.).

The bathrooms are very clean and I am generally impressed with the entire idea behind this business: affordable yet fresh and delicious. LLBO licensed! On that note, Stockyards and Sea Witch could learn a thing or two about the importance of offering beverages to complement their food.

"I've got to say, these guys are legit.

Our crew of High School friends is scattered throughout the country, and last year we decided to start an annual trip to Las Vegas where we all fly in and have fun for a weekend. Last week was trip 2.0, and everybody is still buzzing about it and itching for next years trip to get here already.

Last year my buddy was recommended to Red Carpet VIP, and we got linked up with Jeremy. He set us up at Marquee and everybody had a great time.

This year, our group grew a bit, and my buddy that set everything up last year was busy, so I took over those responsibilities. I got Jeremy's number from my buddy, and it was easy as can be from there. Red Carpet VIP knows their stuff, and they make the process as easy as possible. I told Jeremy how many people we were, what we were looking for, what the budget was, and he set us up with a night at XS.

Then, just hours before we were set to be picked up by our limo to head to the club, we had a buddy fly in to join the festivities. I gave Jeremy a call and five minutes later our friend was good for both the limo and entry to the club with us.

First off, everything is as professional as can be. We got a call earlier in the day from the limo driver just going over the route again and making sure he knew what we wanted. Then we got a call from our host for the night letting us know where to meet him. He informed us that it was XS's 6 year anniversary, which meant everything was done just a bit bigger and better than usual. 

We showed up after our limo ride, and the line that had formed by the time we got there was INSANE because of the anniversary and the fact that Avicii was DJ'ing that night (He showed up late, but still killed it. And the advice from our host to get on the dance floor early to get a good spot couldn't have been more true. It was so packed an hour before Avicii was SET to come on that security stopped letting people enter the dance floor) 

But the huge line was not a problem because we booked with Red Carpet. We met with our host next to the line, he escorted us straight to the front, and we were in. Little did we know that night would end up being probably the most amazing night any of us have ever had. 

Woke up the next afternoon and I had a text from Jeremy asking how everything went. 

These guys are legit. If you want a good time with no worries, book through them. They take care of you. I'm already planning a small trip this summer with Jeremy, and we'll also be in touch with him for our big one next year as well.",1.0

"For the money, simply the best ice cream in Vegas.  Yes, you can pay a lot more elsewhere and get all the pretty presentations and more exotic flavors but if your goal isn't necessarily just impressing your girlfriend with how much you can pay for something and you're just looking for really good ice cream, this is the place.

The scoops are big!  Contrary to the Baskin-Robbins started trend, these folks give real scoops of ice cream.  Stick to one unless you are ready to eat a lot.  The hot fudge is good quality and generously applied and the nuts always seem to be pretty fresh, even if they come from a 50 lb. bag somewhete.

Either way, the pizza is fun to make, you choose from multiple toppings and then the high school kid behind the counter places it in an open ""pizza oven.""  All our pizza turned out tasty, with a crunchy crust and fairly well cooked toppings.  The only glitch is my younger son ordered a plain cheese pizza with regular pizza sauce.  It came out burnt and over half the pizza ""bubbled up."" Essentially inedible for a seven year old with no front teeth.  They offered to remake it and we took them up on their offer.  The old pizza was left on the table and a new one was brought out after about 7 minutes, along with a free pizza coupon.  Nice touch but I prefer the pizza would be made correctly the first time.  Anyway, the cheese would not stay on the cheese pizza, a problem we did not encounter on the other pizzas.",1.0

"I love a good dim sum brunch. And finding delicious and innovative dim sum in the confines of central Toronto was something I had been trying to get to. When my friend suggested Crown Princess instead of my go to suggestion, Pearl Harbourfront, I was all for it. And Crown Princess was pretty spot on. You can tell a good restaurant by how they treat the staple foods. The har gow and Siu Mai here tasted of fresh ingredients.  And what a delightful difference to use foie gras instead of tobiko.  The har gow was not greasy as sometimes it tends to get if sitting in the steamer too long.  The siu mai was crisp in the mouth as each morsel was devoured and the pork was tender and not mushy as some restaurants can be, again if it sits in the steamer too long.

Sirloin beef wrapped in rice noodles (this I would skip next time as it was rather mushy)
Beef meatball on bed of enoki mushroom
Shrimp Rolls

The decor is nice, a little ostentatious but with a name like Crown Princess I guess they cater to the ostentatious.  It also doesn't seem like the price of the dim sum discourages young, old nor families because all of them were present at this downtown establishment.  I will definitely bring my family here next time and try all of the other dishes.  Lots to choose from and this restaurant certainly doesn't disappoint.",1.0

"We did not choose this roofer...the seller of a house that my client ended up purchasing choose Creative Roofing.  After the house closed, we (the buyer) had some roof concerns so we called creative roofing.  Curtis came  out promptly and really went above and beyond for my client, the buyer.  He helped us with things that weren't even his responsibility...certainly creating goodwill for the future.  I was very impressed with his customer service and willingness to help my client (the homebuyer.)  I would be happy to recommend this company to others.",1.0

I ordered the cowboy steak, It was totally awesome, the side salad and the side you get were pretty basic but the entree was huge and delicious. I went on a Tuesday the waiter didn't know  the market price of the lobster or crab legs which makes me think they must not sell too many of them. Stick to the ""famous for.."" dishes like the cowboy steak. (I can vouch for that one)",1.0
It's a fantastic little sit down restaurant with authentic ethnic cuisine. I definitely recommend it if you're looking for somewhere nice to go.,1.0
Amazing experience from start to finish. I got the $95 deep tissues massage. And the complimentary shampoo blow dry after. Grayson did my massage and I highly recommend!

"I went to Flo's restaurant on a recommendation from a co-worker and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the broccoli beef and it was amazing--such wonderful flavor with the sauce, thinly sliced beef and various vegetables--on my way home I started eating some and I could not stop. I really wanted to turn around, go back, and get another order (smile). Next time that I go I will have to sit in versus getting take out as it looks like a very nice and relaxing atmosphere. The staff that I did interact with were very friendly and open to changing the soy based sauce that usually comes with the broccoli beef to a white sauce (I am allergic to soy)

I hope that in the near future that Flo will open up another restaurant--hopefully in Old town Scottsdale or central Phoenix, so those of us who live in Mesa, Tempe, and south of North Scottsdale can have quicker access to Flo's amazing food!",1.0

The salmon was excellent.  Seared to perfection and superb quality of fish.  I loved the mashed potatoes and green beans.  The ceasar salad and the lava cake were average.  The coffee was horrible - watered down.  Overall this place knows how to prepare meat.  Parking can be difficult here and valet at E 4th maybe your most convenient option, I think with receipt the valet cost should be under 10$ but not sure.  The downtown location has great dining rooms on the second level and a rooftop deck.  I'd like to try the deck next time I'm downtown.",1.0

My friend and I decided to meet for lunch but we had limited time available and we were not quite sure where to go so we ventured onto Perry Highway and decided to try out Roma because we saw they had outdoor seating .  After looking at the menu we were told they also offer a lunch buffet inside the dining area so we opted to have the buffet  This was a perfect choice because we were able to try out various menu selections and it saved us the right amount of time to eat . We were told that the entrée choices change day to day.  The restaurant has a huge dining room and a very large bar with an open patio.  It looks like the perfect spot to be on game night.,1.0
"Interesting place. I didn't know a lot about this bakery, but this is not the kind of place where you grab a cup of coffee and a baked good and sit down at a table to enjoy your drink and food and chat with friends. There are no seats or tables. This is a grab and go place. That being said, there is a good variety of baked goods and breads. I ordered a piece of the pudding cake and a piece of the cherry cobbler; my friend ordered the cream cheese danish and a croissant. The stars were the pudding cake and cream cheese danish. The cherry cobbler made me shrug my shoulders...more cherries, please. Anyway, I'll be back when I'm in the area to try more items.",1.0
"sunday night in vegas.  yep, one of those nights.  

party of 11, they sat us altogether and it was not a hassle.  we made reservations, and b\/c it's vegas, i'd recommend making a reservation no matter where you go.  

#1 these burgers were FANTASTIC.  honestly, i was MEH about the idea of burgers when a friend had made the reservations.  there is so much good food in vegas, why hit a burger joint in the venetian?  but i was happily surprised.  meat is juicy, fresh, and cooked exactly the way you order it.  the burgers are creative ,and not any more expensive than any other dedicated burger place - about $11-12 (except for in-n-out).  

i had the Bottom Burner, and it's called that b\/c the expectation is that your bum is going to bleed and burn when this comes out the other end.  sounds yummy, right?  well, it was.  delicious burger, topped with a jalepeno pesto (basically jalepenos chopped up into tiny bits and smeared on there) topped with pepper jack cheese and a giant onion ring.  it was so tasty!

among our group, we basically got one of each burger, and everyone was super happy.  the appetizers were ok - they offer fried pickles and these are definitely worth trying.  fried oysters were also good.  

great drinks, large beer selection.  the Nutella milkshake is a heart attack in a glass but so worth it.  definitely share b\/c it is a lot of milkshake.",1.0

"Very cute and convenient wine bar. They serve wine, beer, small bites and ""sandos"" (sandwiches). It was a little on the pricier side, but what was nice is that they have 32 rotating wines that you can dispense yourself as a 1.5oz, 3oz, or 6oz pour by simply swiping a card they give you and selecting your choice of white or red wine. The wines they have by the glass range anywhere from a silver oaks cab which runs $39 for a 6oz pour to a $2 1.5oz pour for another pretty good, not as well known wine. The small bites are pretty yums. We ordered the bruscetta and the cheese plate, which were both served as a pretty decent portion. 
The service was a little slow, but everyone was very helpful and friendly. I will definitely be back, maybe not as often as id like, due to the price, but this place is perfect for a nice date night.",1.0

"Mill Avenue is awash in sandwich and burger joints. From Ike's to Jimmy John's, Brock Lesnar would have a hard time finding a sandwich sponsor for his fighting jorts. But today I checked out a new spot, Earl of Sandwich. Apparently, its been open for business for about 2 and 1\/2 months but they got a fancy new sign that makes it much more noticeable from my PO Box across the street, so I checked it out.

So, first off, their sandwiches are much more reasonably priced than Jimmy John's. They all come hot. The Ham and Swiss was great and a reasonable size, not too small not too big for the price. I ordered a side of potato salad, which was really tasty and a huge serving. I only finished like 4 spoonfuls and more than half was still left. They have a ton of good sandwich flavors, from a chicken avocado to a Thanksgiving sandwich. I'm looking forward to trying more. It looks like an upscale Subway with the Sandwich inventor shirts on the staff, but actually really good. A plus.

If I was Brock Lesnar, they'd definitely have their logo on my butt. Believe that.",1.0

I came across Me.N.U Food Truck when i was checking the list of food trucks in my work area via their website and when this was at Roy Thompson Hall and relatively close to where I work, my colleagues and I decided to pay them a visit.  Since then I came here on 3 separate occasions already!

I pretty much tried everything on their menu and I have to say, ALL of them taste super great, but if this is your first time and you really want to start it off with a bang, i highly recommend their Kimchi Pulled Pork Poutine.  The sauce and kimchi were fantastic, lots of pulled pork and fries were fried to perfection!  All the ingredients blended in so well together!  For just $11, I think the price is very reasonable considering their big portion and delicious end products!

Ball So Hard combo is also another good choice.  A taco and two fried rice balls are pretty filling for a lunch meal.  For the tacos, i recommend doing the pull pork also as it was more flavorful than the chicken and for the rice balls, both choices are good.

"I've been on a bit of a nail tour lately, so I thought it was time for me to come back to one of my Charlotte favorites. Some things never change. I still love this place.

If you're looking for some big fancy salon, then this is not your place. It's in a strip mall on Central Avenue. It's clean. It's not once of those nail salons where you would walk in and get disgusted by the interior. 

When you walk in, someone immediately greets you and asks what you would like. I've never had an issue of a long wait here. I pick my polish and go sit in my chair. Even if it takes a few moments for someone to free up, you get to enjoy the amazing massage chairs and sip on a glass of wine. I'm okay with that.

They have a top of polish and gel options. The pedicure isn't rushed. A good scrub, lotion, and hot towel are all a part of it. My latest visit I did a pedicure and a gel manicure. My total was $55 before tip.

The people who work here are nice. During my visit Sunday, I watched two different extremely rude customers make scenes for no reason. I was about to lose my cool and go off on both of them. The workers just took it in stride and tried to be as accommodating as possible. Granted, I don't know what they're saying when they speak to each other in a foreign language, but they handled it all well. 

Price-wise, it's a solid, consistent spot to get your nails done. It's what keeps me coming back.",1.0

Oh my goodness, they knock my socks off every time! Each slider has grilled onions, pickles and cheese. I recommend getting a side of pepperoncinis as well!

"As you drive through the little town that is Robinson, you happen to come across a promising restaurant that is Cracker Barrel. With the old timber styled building, you can smell the aroma of a nice wood burning as you take your first breath out of your car. Continuing to walk towards the building, you make the commitment to not only your stomach but your soul. You step within the establishment to an amazement that is the Old Country Store, which is covered from wall to wall in purchasable material that ranges from clothing to candy. As you approach the hostess station you are greeted with a friendly smile and a ""Welcome to Cracker Barrel, how many today?"" Step by step you are lead to your table where a caring server meets you to take your order. As you wait for your food you have the option to play checkers or the infamous Peg Game that is placed on each table. (Now for the good part). The food comes out steaming on a classic white platter. The taste of a hearty, home cooked meal that only your grandmother could have cooked is in every bite you take. As you take your final bites, you are left with the question: ""Will I come back to this restaurant?"" The answer is, Yes. You will come back.

"I have been to Anacapa several times for drinks on the patio and food, and have always had good service and decent- and sometimes much better than decent--food. This is a great place for the more 'settled' crowd (you know, senior citizens) in a beautiful setting overlooking the golf course at Corte Bella in SCW. The reason I'm writing this, though, is not because I've had a good experience every time I've been there, but to describe a special event hosted by my 90 years-young Mom for dinner after my Dad's funeral. Mom wanted to treat the extended family to cocktails and dinner so we went in a week or so before to book arrangements. The extremely nice assistant manager described how they would set up the small private dining room (we had 14 and it was just enough space) with Mom's color choice of linens and the selected menu she picked. He gave us the menu so we could take it home to make our selections. It took one more short visit to close up the details. On the day of the event, the staff was very attentive to our needs on the patio for drinks and when told the venue was ready for seating, they had done the room beautifully with gold charger plates and burgundy linens and a beautifully printed keepsake menu honoring my Dad with his name at the top. The waiter(s) were excellent, going so far as to separate food items in little dishes for my nephew who doesn't like to have his food touching on the plate. Salads and dinner were all delicious. Moreover, the price was extremely reasonable (14 people, cocktail and dinner, under $500?? amazing) and staff went out of their way to make everything easy for us. I just can't say enough for the staff and the chef and will think of Anacapa first when I have a future event to host.",1.0

Everything was SO good.  The second time I ordered a fish taco and 18 monk noodles. Amazing!  The noodles were hand cut.  My husband got the Mongolian beef salad.  We rave about this place.

My boyfriend orders the junior sundae every time and I must say there fudge is die for. They have their weekly flavors daily so it keeps its exciting every week there's a new flavor to try.

"My daughter got married at the Montelucia, Paradise Valley, Arizona on Saturday, November 8th. She was looking to rent gold chairs with pads, table clothes, table chargers and etc. Throughout her search she came across this amazing web-site called You Can't Beat This! Party Rentals and Event Decor and how lucky were we! The customer service with Tuby was amazing and so very helpful. If you have something in mind she will help you find it or do her very best to offer you whatever you need and will beat any price. The quality of all the rentals are excellent on top of the service!  With all that goes on in planning an event you can be sure that there is no stress working along with this company. They are hands on and work along with all venues to make it beautiful!  My other daughter is getting married on April 25 at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, Scottsdale, Arizona and thank you to Tuby for providing us for what we need in making sure everything is taking care of on her special day. No need to look any further and highly recommended if needing any party rentals or event decor:)",1.0
"Excellent food, excellent service. The waiters were handsome to boot  We came during the rush on Thanksgiving and even then the wait was only 15 minutes. I never had to wait for my drink to be refilled and we weren't harassed by the staff at all. My mom is a born and raised Korean and she has nothing but great things to say about the quality of the food. The location is walking distance from UNLV and only a 5 minute drive from the strip, check it out!",1.0
"I cannot put into words what an absolute pleasure it was to dine here, but I will certainly try! 

I fell in love the moment I sat down; the restaurant is open & inviting - which is no surprise, as the staff mirrors those attributes themselves. 

Everything about my experience brought a smile to my face - the food was fresh, creative (the staff is constantly collaborating to come up with new ideas), and unbelievably delicious (so much so that I came back the next day to be able to try more while in town). During my first visit I tried the ""Drink Your Greens"" fresh juice, had the Coconut Curry Noodles for my entree & finished up with the Almond Bar. I essentially had the staff order for me - I mean, the owner is hands on in every way, so I figured why not? She led me in the right direction - and I couldn't stop raving about everything to my fiancé. The Coconut Curry was made with zucchini noodles they made to order, and the pineapple cut through the spice perfectly. I was in love with the Almond Bar from first bite; one of the best desserts I've ever had. And, guess what?! I had all this and left FEELING GOOD! Too awesome!

My lunch today somehow topped yesterday. I had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch smoothie and was at a loss for words on how delicious it was. Better than any smoothie I've ever had (honestly, I could have one every day - and the head chef shared with me that he actually does! haha). The Falafel Sandwich was... Well, you're going to think I'm gushing about this place too much, but just trust me... That Falafel Sandwich is unreal. You can tell they use fresh, organic spices (cumin is one of my favorite spices and this completely blew my mind with how good this cumin was). I spent time talking to the friendly team (did I mention how great these people are?) and found out they grow their chickpeas in house! Yeah, each Falafel Sandwich takes three days to make! Talk about a labor of love! 

I could (and will) talk about my time here for a long, long time. It isn't just a ""hidden gem"" in terms of restaurants are concerned - the food didn't just taste good; I didn't just admire the dedication they have; the service wasn't just prompt, friendly and considerate; this place was more than ""just"" a great restaurant... It was an experience that I am genuinely thankful for.",1.0

The lunch and brunch menu looked delicious so I'll have to pass by another time.",1.0
"Country fried chicken was fresh and, french toast was  tasty.  Food is made from scratch and staff is friendly. Our server was the owner or chef's  daughter and was great. Very clean and we were all really surprised how fast food arrived to table. Food was hot and generous portions. Frequent coffee refills. Will definitely return.

My favorite dish is the Mongolian beef. It's one of the best I've had in Vegas. Good beef to veggie ratio. Perfectly cooked. Spicy but not too hot.

I get it on their combo plate special with Chicken fried rice and an egg roll. It's more than enough to fill me up and an exceptional value. The Chicken fried rice is very good and they give you a large portion.

The only downside of the meal is the disappointing egg roll. The filling is mushy and pretty bland. Plus it's more of what I would call a spring roll than an egg roll. 

Service has been quick and friendly. I usually order to-go but the restaurant is pleasant and clean looking.",1.0

When I asked for chocolate frosted sprinkled (for my sons birthday) they didn't have any but gladly offered to make me some right then.

"Definitely a must try. The manchurian Chili chicken was amazing. Rice dishes were good.  Don't go for the atmosphere, go for the food.   I had first went here with a Groupon, but going back without any discount was still worth it.  Food quality is good and price is very reasonable.",1.0
"Went here tonight after finding out this place was very close to my apartment and I didn't feel like cooking. Probably one of the best decisions I have made in a while with my take out. When I walked in the staff was very prompt to fill me in on what they had to offer seeing as I have never been there. Prices were very reasonable. Next time though, I will be getting a Large because of my boyfriend. Originally wanted to get a garlic crust, but they were all out. I guess that's what I get for coming in 30 mins before they closed. So I opted for a Cheddar Crust Chicken Pot Pie. 

Instructions were very easy to follow. Cooked at 400 degrees for about 50 minutes and came out perfect. The crust was cheesy and flaky at the same time...so good! I find myself to be a very picky eater, usually pushing aside vegetables. But with this...somehow I found myself loving everything! Most specifically, I never find myself eating carrots.... and then I ate all the carrots on my plate. Crazy. 

Overall, I will definitely have to make many more trips here to try different crusts. And I am tempting to get the special order X-Large for a party now!",1.0
"I went here with my wife for a spur of the moment date night. The club itself is very nice and the staff was great. We shared the pickle fries and spinach artichoke dip, which were both very good.

"Love this place. I had gone to the NYC location a few years and always wanted to go back, so I was pleasantly surprised to see a location in Toronto. This is a cozy Swedish cafe located near Kensington Market. It was quaint looking spot located in an old house. I tried the Cardamon Spice Latte and Lavender White Hot Chocolate and both lived up to my expectations and were amazing. Perfect blend of flavors in a cup.",1.0
This was my first time eating here however I eat sushi fairly often. The booths are enclosed which allows for some privacy and extra room if your party is small. We opted for AYCE (well priced) as we mostly do when going out for sushi. The fish is fresh and the portions a good size. The service was great and the servers were very attentive however we went later in the night and it was slow so YMMV. Overall a pleasant experience and I would go again.,1.0
"Oh we love pita jungle! Great food, like seriously everything is yummy! I am having to muscles tonight, a special I've had once before. I love the salads and the pizzas.

"Great place! Food is very good. If you are a sandwich person- I would strongly recommend La Jolla or the roast beef one (can't recall the name at the moment). La Jolla is especially good if you are (or in my case with) a vegetarian. Take out the protein and it is a still a very tasty and filling sandwich.

Service is always very good but can be slow on occasion especially during peak times. However it is obvious that the employees always strive to create a positive experience for customers.

One caveat- this is a local place and is not a chain. As a result, there are no $3.99 specials that you would find on the strip. Expect to pay about $12 per plate. Be assured though- the food is worth it.",1.0
"Okay, I am someone who always hand washes my car. It's my baby, and it's old.

I have a bug guard on the front that has been on the car since 1998. I have been paranoid that it will crack or be pulled off of the front if I was to use a car wash. I need not have worried. I unscrewed my antenna, since the sign advises that you should lower any antennas, and put it in the car with me. 

I was cheap and got the cheapest car wash at $6. It's Vegas, and there is no snow or mud...so a simple wash would be fine. There was a lot of soap used, and my car came out looking amazing! Usually in a car wash, you find that there are spots that have been missed. Not this time. I drove it over to the vacuums...which are included at no extra charge...and got out to dry what water was left on my car. Turns out, not much was left. The dryer did an amazing job. I sprayed my tires, and vacuumed a little bit and was off. I love that the spaces for vacuuming are covered. This makes a big difference in the heat. 

I will definitely be coming back to this location. Although it is not a super convenient  location, it is worth the short trek to get my car clean quickly and thoroughly.",1.0
"Love this place.  The owner (we're pretty sure he was the owner) was really friendly and offered us endless samples of the different flavors of ice cream.  They had some exotic flavors - thai tea, black sesame, taro and well as the usual strawberry, etc.  He told us that all the ice cream is made on site and they even have dairy free ice cream.

We ordered macaroon ice cream sandwiches and they are definitely big enough to share.  You can choose the type of macaroon and ice cream flavor.  Wish we had a place like this in SF.  Will definitely be back when we're in Vegas.",1.0

My boyfriend kept insisting we go on this. They have a Happy Hour that's pretty much AYCE mixed drinks (Vodka, Jack, Rum, just basic stuff) for the whole duration of the ride, which is about 30 minutes.

We bought our tickets ONLINE (Saves you $5!) and got there a little early. We only had to share our little pod with one other group, who turned out to be really cool and fun too. Our bartender was awesome, she was super fast with the drinks. Apparently, they're not supposed to pour you shots? But she did it anyways. 

I drank about 2 shots, 4 mixed drinks in 30 minutes and by the time we got off, we were alllll schwastedddd.

I got a large 1\/2 bbq and 1\/2 hot to share with the family. Man, the wings were just like I remember them..
Large crunchy chicken wings sauced perfectly, not like the mushy tiny chicken fetus wings you get at Wingstop. Nothing beats the original; nothing...

I was looking to fill up a candy jar with a colorful assortment for a gift and I was able to mix and match from all the bins in the store.  It was a huge hit!  They have gummy teeth,  skulls and spiders for Halloween. Everything is tasty too. Giant gummy bear on a stick even!  I just love this shop. Great for gift bags or baskets,  stocking stuffers come Christmas. In the quaint downtown Container Park.",1.0
"My fiancé and I visited Burger Royal tonight while on an engagement trip from Ontario. We came because I read that they had gluten-free options, and since I have Celiac, I was down to get a good burger. The staff was bilingual and very friendly. I was delighted to see the ""mushroom kingdom"" burger, we had a good laugh. Unfortunately, they didnt have any more gluten-free hamburger buns in stock. I opted for some sweet potato fries after being told there's no cross-contamination between fryers. My fiancé grabbed a bacon poutine. Again, in a bit of bad luck, they were out of sweet potato fries. They felt bad enough to comp an order of regular french fries for me, which was very sweet! My partner reported the bacon poutine being awesome, citing the delicious cheese curds. We had a great time, very cozy place. If you have Celiac or are interested in this gluten-free options, it might be a good idea to call ahead and ask if they have the buns. 5 stars! Thanks, guys!",1.0
"This is my favorite sandwich franchise so you can imagine how excited I was when I saw that one had opened up on Mill Ave! It's my go to in Vegas when I want something quick and my go to in downtown Disney (Anaheim, CA) when we're all hungry after a long day of walking. 

I usually go for the Veggie or Caprese but I've never heard anyone complain about the taste of any of the other sandwiches. In fact, it's my grandpa's favorite tuna melt...and he loves tuna! 

The sandwiches are moderately priced and they're  pretty consistent with the taste (always a plus with franchise restaurants). With the Tempe location, I really loved the friendliness of the staff. Everyone was available to answer questions and help us find what we needed right away! The location of the actual shop is easily missed as its squeezed right in between two other establishments.

"Had the pleasure of trying the Chili Man with some fun friends the other day.  There was a line, but well worth the wait since Vic definitely entertains you while waiting.  There is also the problem of deciding what you want since the menu is so delicious and you can't really go wrong with any choice - even build your own.

I had the Naco and the Heroin.... both of them were gone in 60 seconds.  Since Vic is a one man show, you can see how much love and personality he puts into all his hot dogs... which is unique when you think of a ""hot dog cart"" on the street.  Definitely a great staple to add to your Uptown Charlotte experience.  

Even after my dogs were secured in my belly, I was watching Vic interact with the customers and everyone definitely walks away with a smile and one hell of a chili dog.  There is a lot to be said in putting pride into your work and it definitely pays of for the Chili Man.  I've never seen a hot dog vendor chop a fresh onion (most are pre-prepared or soaking in liquid for who knows how long), but that's just one of the man details that this man puts into his creations.",1.0
"Shealyn is by far the reason why my husband and I still smile when we think about our wedding. From the very first meeting to the final hour of the wedding, Shealyn truly went above and beyond to make our day special.

Not only is she very organized, she is always 10 steps ahead of any bride\/groom anxieties - especially on the day of the wedding. Her work is flawless and every single guest at our wedding commented on her enthusiastic professionalism and perfect execution. I have no doubt in my mind that my husband and I will be hiring Shealyn again in the near future for our family events and celebrations.",1.0
"Ahhhh...the pumpkin spiced latte has finally went down my gullet and it was not that shabby. Good flavor, not overwhelming and not too sweet like some of the Christmas drinks. The price is way too high and that is likely my one and only pumpkin treat. A grande was about $5.50 with 400 calories. Now, you can almost buy a decent lunch for that price, so coffee drink prices are too high, but the drink is worth trying to savor the taste of the season.",1.0
"One of the nicer airports I have seen. Upon my departing from the plane I noticed a bunch of slot machines in the airport.

At McCarran, by the time I walked up to the belt the bags had already began to come out and it smooth and people didn't hover around for awhile and prevent others from getting their luggage. I also was able to grab a cab immediately after exit. Again, the polar opposite of what you receive here in a NY Airport.",1.0

Literally everything blew me away. But your must have list begins: Amberjack crudo, fanny bay oysters with Ponzu salsa, prime ribeye with waffle fries, shrimp & mint wrapped in cucumber!

We didn't care of the kitchen was busy. We wanted a seat and a drink. The drinks were excellent, and so fairly priced.  Our waitress was very helpful educating us on the excellent sushi choices. We were soo happy with her suggestions. The manager was more than awesome. He overheard us talking about a sticky seat we discovered.  He came to us immediately and took care of the issue. He told us about the duck bacon (which sounded awful to us), and gave us a sample. It looks like a strip of ham and tastes like bacon!!  Very good. The chef came over and told us about his desserts. We opted for creme brûlée. They were out. Better get the ice cream sundae with his absolutely awesome brownie!,  whew!! Made in his heaven. We will definitely be going back. Love the bar area.",1.0

"My favorite local spot! Where to start? Great value, $5 craps, $5 blackjack. Poker $2, $4, $6! The staff is great, and everytime I see them we'll talk and make jokes. They know me, and I don't feel like just another number. When playing craps they'll remind me to make bets I would of forgot about, remind me when a bet falls. (Also tip your table dealers, they deserve it). The drink servers are great always coming around making sure I have a fresh drink (same thing give them a tip they do not miss a beat at the tables). Promotions are great, Snaps is great, just all around great! 

My complaints, smoke EVERYWHERE. There is no non smoking area (other than the poker table in the center), not good for someone like me with lung problems. I hate playing at a table no one is smoking at and right next to me has to sit a smoker. Should be a smoking table and non smoking version of the tables. Like one craps is smoking, one is not (or at least one side of the table is smoking and one is not)

People cashing checks, takes forever! Even more when they're new to the system. There is only one cashier pit and on busy days and pay days it gets stupid long and slow.

The intercom\/pa system. Seriously I cannot understand one word that is said on that thing even when I'm standing next to the announcement!! Either turn the volume way up, or get a new system! And please stop putting your mouth right on the mic it just muffles the already hard to hear and understand announcements (not saying who)

Poker. Seriously advertise this more! Not one or two signs just by the tables, come on you can do better! Put signs by the entrances, hang up signs, make regular announcements. It's sad to see poker only busy when it's a tournament and the rest of the time it's dead!

But this place has one of the best promotions, comps, and staff in the area. And even with the smoking it's still hands down better than the others to me.",1.0

"The Good:
- Very, very good Mexican food. It is absolutely delicious. Though I haven't tried a majority of the food, the chicken and pastor taco mexicas are delicious. The nachos are also very good!
- Complimentary chips and salsa! They give two types of salsa, one mild and one hot. 
- Most importantly, the food is very fresh! It's always made to order, and comes out hot!
- It is very price conscious also!

The Bad:
- It is very, very small. Maybe fifteen seats available at the most, and unless you time it perfectly, you probably won't get a seat. However, they do have take out available, if that option works for you.

Everybody we interacted with in that office has been nothing but friendly and courteous. Their business is growing and I think that is the best testament to their superb professionalism!",1.0
"I love MELT! So glad when the Mentor location opened, closer drive from my hometown of Erie, PA. My favourite sandwich is the Parmageddon, but once in a while I like to change things up. The jalapeño popper is another go-to that's really tasty. Can't wait to be back on the east coast and get my fill again...",1.0
"I have been going to Udupi for over 15 years. Its by far the best Dosa I have found in Toronto. 

I tend to generally get the same things when I go; The masala dosa and the veggie thali. If there are more than two of us i'll add in a second dosa and the mixed appetizers or even an extra main veg dish. The thali varies depending on the day and you can ask what is in it that day in case there are things you don't like you may be able to swap it out. the soup that comes is amazing always. The spice level varies depending on who is the main cook. Sometimes its very hot but generally its spicy but not super hot.

I have gone with someone gluten free and the dosa was certainly not as good. but gluten free is specific and when the main part of something is the dosa best to try some other options as well.

They have some special stuff for kids and are vegan friendly. I would highly recommend the food here.

The decor is a bit unusual. Its a kind of cafeteria style dining experience in that its one big sparsely decorated mostly white room with tile floors and an abundance of tables and chairs. They do serve you though so not cafeteria in that way. They have many wall murals that are interesting to say the least. The noise level can get intense when its full as the sound echo's and reverberates. and often there are kids running around.

the staff is generally quite friendly and when you ask questions they are always ready to help. You could have a very big group here as well as they will put a bunch of tables together for you.

I have once gone on Christmas day and had a wonderful experience. They even have a Christmas Dosa done up like a decorated tree in a case. what more can I say??? this place is really a very special vegetarian landmark.",1.0

"This just became my go-to spot for Asian food in Charlotte. The service was impeccable! Staff were friendly and our food came out quickly. 

We ordered the chicken lettuce wraps and steamed pork dumplings to start. The dumplings were okay; the sauce and filling both could have been more flavorful. The lettuce wraps shone in comparison though. It was a sizable and very flavorful appetizer. 

For an entrée I ordered the vegetarian spicy Kung Pao with tofu. It was a little spicy, perfect for my taste. There were lots of vegetables and it was a generous serving.

Overall, my husband and I were very pleased! our bill was less than $40, including the tip, which is rare for us. We will definitely be going back soon!",1.0
"I like to let results speak for themselves. About two years ago I had a tooth that was literal half gone. Tooth had eroded to the point where I could feel it give when I pushed down on it and I had been without dental insurance for nearly 7 years. When I went to the doctor I was certain they'd have to pull it but the female receptionist was optimistic for me.

Well, about 4 months later I can safely say I have a very natural looking cap that didn't make me want to travel to Mexico for a good price. 

Everything is comfortable, you listen to your choice of music via Pandora and everyone seems very friendly in a very clean office.

"Babystacks is a great place to start off the day - great food and reasonable prices.  Me and the hubby usually get eggs and bacon, which also comes with potatoes (I would recommend the hashbrowns) and toast\/english muffin.  They have a kids menu, and for about $6 you get a small pancake, egg any style, potatoes, and a meat (sausage or bacon) - that's a pretty good deal for kids.  The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!

I would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.

Oh, and I think they have pretty good coffee too - most restaurants I think have really strong and basic flavored coffee, but I've always thought that they have decent coffee here.",1.0
"I have been going to Harbourfront Medical for years...all the way from the Beach. Why? Because Dr. Raddatz is amazing. Thorough, caring and considerate. She is totally worth the trip. They also have a new doctor that works only Wednesdays, he has a great approach and I would see him again in a heartbeat were I not able to see Dr. Raddatz. I have always found the receptionists to be helpful and the nurse\/tech provides excellent care and is efficient.  Having on site opportunity for providing blood samples etc. is great, eliminating the need for an extra trip to a lab",1.0

(Shoutout to Dr Serrano and Dr Day) I was hungry and finally had a chance to sneak in some me time so I decided to take myself to lunch. There's a ton of local eateries in this biltmore-ish area so I was determined to check something off my Yelp! Bookmark list. Urban tacos it is! In a seemingly boring strip mall but beautifully designed inside. The door was open and letting in the cool breeze of the day. I was short on time and didn't want to overindulge so I stuck to my budget and schedule and ordered a Corona 2 street tacos and a half order of chips and guacamole. The service was good. She recommended the green chile cilantro salsa which was excellent and the short rib taco, equally as good.

"All of the yes. Everything I put in my mouth from them was magical. The miso soup was hot and flavorful. The shrimp tempura was crisp and the sauce they sent with it was complex and multifaceted. The chirashi was some of the freshest I've eaten and the forbidden rice was delicious as well. I've always thought I hated wasabi, but it turns out I only hate powdered wasabi - the fresh stuff is delicious in moderation.",1.0

This place was pretty good. My only issue is that there were more beans and rice than there was tacos and I'm not a huge fan of beans even though the beans were pretty tasty. The tacos themselves were really delicious. The workers were nice and the food came out quick. The environment is a chill one. I'll definitely be coming here to try some other stuff!,1.0
"Dr. CHAD Campbell only doc your WHOLE family needs to see. Awesome.  He was on Shea \/ Tatum at PV fam medical e but left last year or two, any my family FOLLOWED him.

"Giving this place 5 Stars again due to the service provided by Larry and the other food-runners. We returned with my in-laws and were seated in the corner booth by the bar. We requested Larry again because he is awesome! The macaroni and cheese is one of my favorite as it is so different from others out there. My wife and I got the brisket  and pork tacos to share plus the sweet potato fries, the fries could have been a little hotter, but they were still yummy. The in-laws got the brisket and it was done to perfection. The only thing was one dish was a little more fatty than the other, as that happens with brisket. We ordered the peach cobbler to share and it was hot and tasty. We will be back! The corner booth is the place to sit as you can see all the different drinks being made.",1.0

As others have mentioned, Alex is a great host! I hope this place does well, its nice to have a real Greek restaurant in town. 
We also tried the feta saganaki which was encrusted in black and white sesame seeds, served with a fig ""chutney"". This was amazing too!  They don't light this one on fire (they offer that one too), and feta is not the norm for saganaki, but, its a wonderful creative spin. 
The small Greek salad was somewhat underwhelming and very small, but, everything else was great and all of the other plates we saw coming out looked fantastic.

"I love this place. I have been here many times. They have a dress code and its not a bad thing- come on, no ripped jeans or baseball cap (Men) isn't a big deal :)This place is trendy with sophisticated decor as well as location. They have a decent variety of small plates, hookah flavors and desserts. It is on the pricy side so expect to spend some $$$ there. There is a wide range of ages you see there so its not just a place for the young or the old. I have tried some of their apps so can only speak for the things I have tried and that goes same for the drinks and desserts.   They do have specials during the week but weekend is reservation based.",1.0

Charming and friendly service alongside authentic and delicious Venezuelan cuisine made with fresh ingredients.

"I don't see why people are saying this place is bad. I got a shellac manicure and a regular pedicure with Andrea and it's been a month and it still looks amazing. The decor is clean and modern but the staff is super friendly and the owner brings in her two small dogs. As a dog lover, I approve. They have an espresso machine so they'll offer you anything you'd like on the house...you can tell the place has a good reputation in the area because I was there for two days in a row and every time there were customers chatting it up with the staff so you know they were return customers. Andrea is sweet, a perfectionist and really wants to make sure you're happy with what you paid for. She only uses CDN products (same company that does shellac) and she won't charge extra for using these high end products. I've had manicures where I've been cut with their little cuticle scissors or times where my pedicure was painful because of the blade thing they use to take off the hardened skin of your foot but not with Andrea. She is so meticulous and she loves what she does. It really shows through her work. She even gave me her card with a 5$ discount for my next mani or pedi with her. Honestly if you're going to get a mani or pedi done go to Larousse and ask for Andrea, you won't be disappointed.",1.0
In love with this place!! I'm half Korean and recently moved here from Hawaii and I am so happy to have found a place like home. The owners are so sweet and the food is delicious.

"I came here on the Saturday night during Memorial Day weekend which any traveler to Las Vegas knows is a very busy weekend in Las Vegas. I and my friends were able to find a promoter to get us in with no cover. Just to point out something... our group had a major girl to guy ratio. 

After a quick entry we found that the tryst is actually a very luxurious and well-kept club which is something that impressed me off the bat. Secondly the DJ plays in front of a beautiful waterfall that just makes everything seems so surreal. They played a good blend of both edm, hip hop, and generally good dancing music. The bartending service was excellent and friendly just be forewarned that just like any other major clubs in Las Vegas drinks aren't cheap... girls do get one free drink however. 

Overall if you're looking for somewhere for you and your friends to come and have a really good time and a memorable experience in Las Vegas without the major cover charge, the hassle of the giant line and just want good music without a specific headliner I highly recommend this place I sure had a really good time! Ahh Vegas always surprises me.",1.0

We went back for the second time to see if it was a fluke the first time (shrimp, potatoes, sausage boil) Tonight, we tried the king crab boil  and the catfish. Both dishes came out fast and were better than expected.  Catfish was a good size with plenty of fries seasoned in a cajun spice. Crab was fresh and seasoned just the right amount. 
We have to give a huge round of applause to our server, Chris. He was happy to be there, checked on us the right amount of times, and made sure we had everything we needed. Great job!

This place has a super thorough collection of hundreds of board and card games for you to try, plus a full bar and food options, all for $5 cover.  It's a pretty popular place though, and we've seen lines of up to 30 minute waits on Monday & Tuesday nights.  

It is a full-service spot, which means there is waitstaff to take your food & drink orders, and game masters to help pick out, bring you, and -- get this -- introduce and walk you through how to play each and every game so you don't have to struggle with the instructions and spend more of your time laughing and strategizing with your friends.  All of the staff there is super friendly and the vibe of the place can't be beat.  

Their menu is straightforward but covers a wide gamut -- they have sandwiches, salads, nuts, olives, gummies, nachos, beer, wine, shots, hot drinks.  Though I can't really speak to the food there, I offer fair warning that their pulled pork nachos ($12 CAD) is easily one of the worst things I've ever ordered anywhere in my whole life.  Like plastic on cardboard, no exaggeration.  But that didn't ruin our night at all; that's how amazing this place is.",1.0

"Clean, relatively inexpensive hostel conveniently located across street from Waverly train station.

PROS
* Inexpensive. Only £9.90 per night for a 10-bed female dorm bed.
* 10-bed female dorm was spacious. Plenty of room for backpacks and to spread out your crap. Also rolling drawer storage under beds where you can lock your valuables.
* Free towel! I was shocked to see a towel on each bed. Hostels in the UK and Ireland normally charge extra for towel rental.
* Free continental breakfast. Not a bad spread consisting of white bread, spreads, cheese, turkey slices deli-style, cereals, milk, juice, yogurt, instant coffee, hot water. Served 7-9am and a good place to meet people.
* Chillout room is a great place to meet people and watch TV or DVDs. Learned from someone I met there that St. Christophers hostels are known for being ""party hostels.""
* Upon check-in, you're given all relevant information regarding check-in and check-out, free walking tour info, map along with your card key.

Now, I have had successful donations and I have had unsuccessful donations.  At one point I had to take a 16 week break.  Things happen.  But reality is what it is.  Sometimes it just doesn't work out for one reason or another.  Back in the day if you had a failed attempt in one arm followed immediately by a failed stick in the other, they'd apologize and send you on your way with a bandage on both arms and no donation.  No need to be upset about it.  It happens.  It is simply fortunate that I can donate.  Many can't but I cant see getting upset about it.  For whatever reason it just wasn't time NH.  Whether it was something in the questionaire or who knows. 

 I have yet, in all the time I have been going there ever felt unwelcomed or unwanted there.  Sorry you prepared so heavily and feel let down.  I can say the staff are all wonderful.

"It's a shame Barrel Junction suffers from a lack of visibility - it's truly tucked away right near the junction of Route 8 and Route 910 in Gibsonia. It's practically hidden behind a barber shop. I think this place would be booming if it had better visibility from the road. 

Location woes aside, I really loved my first experience at Barrel Junction last week. I am currently eating leftover barbecue chicken dip for lunch. That item alone below me away - a cheesy, creamy dip stuffed to the brim with BBQ brisket, bacon, onions, accompanied by tortilla chips, and served in a miniature cast-iron skillet. It's honestly one of the most impressive, and tastiest, appetizers I've ever had. 

Barrel Junction is a neatly decorated bar and restaurant, if a bit dark. It has a stained-wood theme with all sorts of awesome artwork on the walls. I didn't get any drinks from the bar when I was there, but it looked large, and quite busy. Their draft selection seemed pretty big just based on the chalkboard behind the bar. 

Food quality was really, really good. Portions are enormous, or at least the caprese salad I ordered was. It was brought to our table in a metal mixing bowl big enough to wear on your head like a helmet. The flavors all came together quite well, and while the presentation maybe was a little less than 'refined,' I went home with enough salad to pack for lunch the next day. 

I had read some less than savory reviews about service here, but I gave it a try anyway and had no complaints. Our food was served quickly and at the appropriate temperature. 

My only complaints are that I felt some of the appetizers were a bit overpriced, and finding this place is honestly a little frustrating if you don't know where to look. But, overall, I enjoyed the casual atmosphere, and the food was a welcome surprise. I hope this place can thrive where it's at, because it really brings something new to the Hampton\/Gibsonia area.",1.0

Set up an appointment with Marie to get my hair deep conditioned. During and after the treatment she gave me tips on how to maintain my natural mane and give it more diverse looks.

Service here has always been good. I like how they give you a nice big glass pitcher of water with your glasses so you don't have to worry if the server is going to come back to quench your thirst constantly.

"Delicious! I honestly stumbled upon this place completely by accident and was so pleasantly surprised.

I ordered the veggie entree which allows you to pick 4 of the vegetarian options (there are many to choose from including falafel, grape leaves, lentils, tabouleh, etc). My waitress was incredibly helpful as I had no clue what to pick! I was presented with a HUGE plate of food and every bite was phenomenal. I love the ability to pick and choose so that I was able to get exactly what I wanted and sample a few of their different dishes at once.

Service was wonderful - my server Courtney was awesome! I will definitely be returning when I'm back in the area!",1.0
"I kept it simple on my 1st visit and ordered a pepperoni slice with a side of ranch and a vanilla coke. I'm glad I only ordered 1 slice because the slices are huge! They sell 14"" slices and 28"" pies. I was full before I even finished my slice. Other sauces they offer for dipping are marinara and garlic sauce.

They have monthly specials, so that will keep me coming back to try all the delicious combinations they come up with.

"This isn't my favorite cirque show, however, I don't think there's such thing as a bad cirque show. These people are insanely talented and it's obvious how much thought and money goes into producing each and every show. 

That said, this show comes off lower budget than the ones with zillion dollar rotating stages and pools (Ka and O). Each every cirque show is meant to be its own unique variety though, so that's how I saw this one. 

I love the preshow done at all these shows, and the two clowns at this one are really hilarious and involved in the audience. The performers that also do the same around them are great too. 

We saw the juggler mess up on stage but she recovered and that shit is hard so more power to her. She was my husband's favorite of the entire show. I felt like the audience wasn't responding to the entire show like the entertainers deserved but it was a very sparse crowd during a slow season. 

My favorite part of the entire show was the flying duo - the twin blonde guys that are featured on the ticket cover when you buy. Amazing and flawless. 

The people in this show are literally risking their bodies and lives to entertain you, the audience, so appreciate that about them and the fact of how much training and personal discipline this kind of talent really takes before you say you just don't like it. 

The theater is stunning and the seats are comfy - we were six rows from the front in the big sofas! 

I felt the screen was used a lot and wasn't always a fan of how it was used but wow, the main singer was phenomenal - and how she sounds like that while upside down and all around literally blows my mind. How?! I've also seen some talented aerial performers but the ones here such blew the top off any of that, mostly the solo aerialist that did the handstand work. Wow! Amazing acts. 

I've seen a lot of the more circus type acts before - but I've never seen them set up and launch successfully so quickly. Bravo! I was disappointed that the trapeze act would mess up and not try that move again though until succession or even for a second shot at doing it. I can't wait to see the rest of the cirque shows I haven't seen yet!",1.0
"Excellent place to take anyone visiting Madison, food- and location-wise. Great selection of everything great in locally influenced food, but up a few notches in quality from usual bar food.

"Sneeky Dee's, with its graffiti covered walls, booths and restrooms is a fascinating place to visit. A true dive bar known for its Tex-Mex. I'd personally recommend the nachos.

Corn chips piled high with assorted veggies, beans, cheese, secret sauce, guac and sour cream. Awesome!

Our servers have always been attentive and there's plenty of beer on tap along with a full bar with surprisingly good cocktail prices.

This is cheesy, crunchy, salty Tex-Mex that's best shared between friends and a round of drinks. For the experience alone, I'd say it's one of the better places in Toronto. A must stop when I'm in town.",1.0
Solid food and fantastic service. They also have a ton of space so you don't usually have to wait. I've tried the Potato Rosti and the French toast with bacon- both were delicious. Reason why I didn't give them 5 stars is because the portions are a bit small.,1.0
"My wife and I dine out 1-2 times a week and have tried most places in Gilbert so we know what we can expect from a Gilbert restaurant.  I found High Tide on Yelp a few months ago and decided to try it out last night with my wife.  When we arrived, the hostess was very friendly and walked us to the large centerpiece bar where we could watch the cooks preparing various seafood dishes.  About 30 seconds later, our waitress who was very friendly (I think her name was Jen?) greeted us and took our drink order.  Great selection of draft beers and the cocktail menu was very good too.  My wife had the prickled pink which was very good.  We ordered the high tide combo and the calamari appetizer and figured we would just share and graze.  It was fun to watch the chef Roger assemble the combo and pull from the big tray of various seafood kept on ice.  For the price and quality, I was very impressed.  The size of the shrimp were more like small sausages and were amazing as was everything else on the platter and very indulgent.  The calamari was a generous portion and the Old Bay Lemon Aioli was so good with it.  Only nitpick thing I can say, which is really small is when they serve the high tide combo, they should have a 4th small bowl of horseradish and not have it mixed in with the cocktail sauce.  Not a big deal at all though since they brought my wife a new cup. Based on other dishes we saw prepared you can tell they don't skimp on the seafood.  Overall food presentation is very well done.

John, the manager came out and greeted each person sitting at the bar and you can tell he likes his job because he is very good at it.  He was running around the restaurant making sure everyone felt great and cared for.  Every person who we interacted with at High Tide was very attentive and hospitable to us.  Can't wait to come back and try the Cioppino (my favorite) and the Sea Bass. Quality service is a large portion of our dining experience and this place nailed it! Based on our experience with other restaurants in the Gilbert area which are great, this place raised the bar.  You can tell it's a finely tuned establishment and we will definitely be back!",1.0

"I want to move to Vegas so that I can visit this place every week. Many ramen places I've been to have soup base that is too salty, Misoya Tomi's ramen has beautifully balanced flavor and rich soup base made from real miso, which reminds me of the authentic ramen I had in Japan. The service was very quick and friendly. The server took her time to explain the ramen options and the differences in the 3 types of ramen (origin, popularity, flavor...etc.). Great escape from the strip for some authentic and reasonably priced Japanese cuisine.",1.0
I've been getting hair extensions done for a long time and I've gone and seen so many different stylist because some have moved some where not to my standard! But I'm so happy I've found crystal she is the best stylist I've ever had! I've never had anyone do my hair like she did! People where coming up to me asking where I got my hair done all the time she made my Extentions look so natural people thought it was my own hair! They lasted about 8 weeks and I could have probably gone longer but my hair (I did not buy from her) started to get thin!

I love that they have a 'salsa bar' there, complete with to go containers. There are salsas, vegetables and even sliced limes. Limes are a must have in my opinion, as they really make the flavor pop.

My husband got the al pastor burrito, as he had been craving this for a few days. He was really pleased with the flavor. The burrito was also very filling.

"If you want a chance to dine at Inspire, you definitely need to plan ahead and make a reservation during busy periods. I went once spontaneously on Sunday and was told by the waitress that they were fully booked until 9:30pm. This restaurant serves incredible food for a good price, which might just be the reason why it became so popular. 

I've been to the restaurant once so far for lunch because many people were recommending the chicken waffles there. Unfortunately, they did not serve that during lunch hours so I ended up getting the Korean beef sandwich, which exceeded my expectations. The sandwich itself had great flavour, and they don't skimp out on the meat. I added a few dollars to upgrade my side to the pulled pork frites and it was worth every penny. The frites were cut thin and packed full of pork and other flavours that made it so delicious.

"I came here for lunch today with my family for AYCE. It was around 26 per person for the whole day since today is a holiday, but I think weekdays are 20 for lunch and 23 for dinner. The restaurant itself is pretty big too so a large group can also be seated (maybe better to reserve first). 

First I was pleased with the service, everything was pretty quick and our refills were quick as well. I love AYCE both sushi and bbq so I've been to lots of different places, but the quality here is definitely top-notch. We also ordered some samgyupsal, and that is also a good choice for anyone who loves to eat pork belly. 

They have some good side dishes, and overall I think its awesome compared to the price. I've been to cheaper places with some of my friends, but there is definitely a difference in quality as much as the difference in price. I also really enjoy AYCE sushi as well but that goes up to 30 per person on just dinners, so for eating some good quality AYCE meat I think its great. 

Overall I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to eat good quality AYCE meat for a fair price.

"wow, my daughter and I had a blast. Spent 7hrs at wet n wild for an early birthday celebration. Her bday isnt until this weekend but figured we would go before the holiday because I was afraid it would be packed. It wasnt too busy. The lines were decent and because we got there at opening it was awesome parking and well worth our time being there. We went on every single ride at least once andy daughters favorite which was the 'rainbow' slide we went on 5 times with barely any wait at all. Longest wait was probably 15mins for one of the slides. Wasnt bad at all. The food line was super busy right around lunch time between 12-2. But after that rush was over there were no lines for the food or drinks. Almost all of the lounges chairs and cabanas were full but because it was only me and my daughter I didnt need a lounge chair or cabana. I had to go on all he rides with her. Going with a bigger group would be well worth getting a cabana or saving up some lounge chairs for everyone. The locker area was perfect. Easy to use and awesome system they had going on. Wristbands to open up the lockers. Parking was $7. And lockers ranged from $8.00-$12.00 I think. The bigger the locker the most money it was. The smallest lockers were $8.00. And it kept going up from there. Medium and larger available also. They have dippin dots there!!! Omg I love dippin dots. Dippin dots use to be in the malls but now they're just at sports events and wet n wild.  I enjoyed those and introduced my daughter to them. Yummy!! Food was pizza, hot dogs, burgers, chicken casear salad, chicken sandwitches, chicken wrap, and bbq pulled pork. All come with fries chicken wrap came with a fruit cup. They have Icee's, and pretzels, and lemonade for sale st some stands. The lifeguards if you really watch them are highly trained and very alert and literally scan back and forth like robots watching the lazy river and wave pool. I was impressed by the way they scanned their heads back and forth staring at the lazy river. I have never seen that before. They werent just watching they were literally scanning. The stairs kinda sucked going up to the slides. It was never ending stairs...in the heat plus carrying a HUGE float was brutal but I guess thats the price you pay going to a super high slide. My legs will be feeling it tomorrow. They have a few misting devices going up the stairs I suggest that maybe they need more. On the lines waiting for the floats they had umbrellas and some misting devices which was a lifesaver due to the insane Vegas heat. 108 today and I survived 7hrs of wet n wild. My daughter had a blast and we look forward to maybe going again someday.",1.0
This is a great place to eat at it is authentic Mexican food and done right came here yesterday in the evening with a friend of mine and her two kids she's been here before but this was my first time being here and I have to say that I like this place they have a station that you can stand at depending on what you want you tell the cook that's making it he makes it in front of you and your orders ready to go and you can go to the salsa area and choose what kind of toppings you want the people here are friendly it's very clean not sure about the bathrooms because I didn't go into the men's bathroom but judging by how they keep the restaurant clean I'm pretty sure it's the same overall I plan to make the trip here again the only negative about this place is it is pretty pricy especially when your coming with 4 people but that's my only gripe 5 stars for me.,1.0
"I thought of this is a Thai restaurant, but with a limited menu of noodle dishes only. We started with the dumplings and they were okay, but nothing extrude art. I had the Kee Mao with chicken and it was very flavorful, the noodles were large, and boy was it spicy. I would definitely get it again, but lower spice level.  I like some spice and was advised to under-estimate so I went with a 1 on their 0 to 5 scale. However, I'd ask for a 0.5 (if that's an option) or 0 next time so I don't have to drink 5+ glasses of water again.

"Meat & Potatoes, the name says it all!

So after catching a review for this on the food network a year ago I have been going crazy wanting to go here and try the ""Meat on a plate with potatoes for 2"" haha.

So first off let me say this, this place is small, but very nice! The waiting area has very comfortable couches and the waitstaff are amazing.

The seats at the table are tall-back chairs that are quite possibly the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in, after our meal I just wanted to take a nap in the chair.

Anyways onto the food and staff.

Our waiter was awesome, very attentive and left a bottle of water at the table. I love this and wish more places did this. Being able to serve ourselves more water and having you replace the entire bottle is the best idea, wish more restaurants would do this. He had great suggestions, knew how things tasted on the menu and really made our night.

The food.

Well obviously we had the steak for two with steak frites and bone marrow. The steak was HUGE, enough for 3 people!!! It was not only cooked perfect but the flavors were out of this world. It was tender, juicy and was perfectly seasoned.

The steak frites were huge and tasted great but the winner here was the marrow. I LOVE bone marrow. This is like the food from heaven. I love spreading it on bread, or in this case, my fries!

We ordered a few sides including the poutine and fried pickles. So the ""Snacks"" are as big as appetizers but come at half the price. The poutine was perfect. The fries were crunchy and salty, the gravy very meaty and the cheese curds were actual curds! They did in fact squeak on your teeth haha. The poutine was exactly as I hoped it would be.

The fried pickles are chips, but they are THICK and I mean THICK. The pickle itself had an amazing pickling, I'm not quite sure what they used but it was great!

Luckily, that didn't happen and since then Regency Theaters bought it, basically gutted the theaters and put in all new seats and still kept the same prices.  I mean, two dollars everyday except on Tuesdays when the movies are only a buck!! You can't beat that. Concessions have gone up but the quality of the snacks have also gone up. They still have the Super Nacho in which you get extra cheese and I guarantee that you will run out of chips before running out of the cheese. The classic one dollar hot dogs are still good when you don't have a lot of money to spend (probably why you come by to see a cheap movie anyway). The movie sound and look are all digital now so for the money...you can't go wrong!! Anybody who complains that they are not as good as The Galaxy or Regals can go and pay the $10 to $15 bucks a ticket and the $15 tub of popcorn. I'm sticking with Tropicana...especially on a nice matinee day to just chill out. Thanks for bringing it back from almost being gone Regency!!",1.0

"My wife an I are from California, but we have a place in Las Vegas and we needed to replace about 50 linear feet of moulding that was warped by a toilet tank leak. We simply looked up recommendations on the Internet and one was nearby - Future Floors on Dean Martin. We went in and braced ourselves for the impossibility of finding any way to match the 6-1\/2"" custom baseboard. We ended up meeting and explaining our situation to Eric Jordan, the owner. He was a very nice man and he took a look at the sample we brought in. Within a couple minutes he had found the correct moulding. He noted they didn't carry it in stock. But rather than offer to order it for us, he knew we needed to save time, so he sent us to a place where he thought they should have it in stock. He wrote the model number down for us, provided us directions to get to the place and even called ahead for us to make sure they did have it. We were almost in shock it was so easy. Mr. Jordan was friendly, read our situation and helped us out enormously, saving us a lot of time with his expertise. Although we didn't end up purchasing anything from Future Floors, we believe they would be a great place to buy flooring from since the owner is so genuinely helpful.",1.0

"We were in the neighbourhood so decided to try Chipotle for the first time.  It was very busy since it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  Despite the crowd, the line moved very fast.  I had the sofritos burrito.  It was very flavourful with nice smoky flavour.  The hot salsa wasn't stupidly hot but had a nice kick and the guacamole was the best I've had at any fast food Tex Mex place. 

It was pricier than I expected but that is probably the cost for top notched ingredients.  I have not seen organic tofu sofritos anywhere else.  I would have preferred that they grilled the burrito.  Because the line moved so fast I didn't see if there was an option for extra cilantro or jalapenos.  I liked that they had different bottles of Tabasco sauces available for all - original red, green jalapeno and chipotle.

Staff couldn't have been more friendly or helpful. I made a selection from the current brews and went with JauJa. I was happy with my choice but for some reason it did have a slightly burnt aftertaste. Possibly beans roasted too long? I will probably give them another try but if that's how they roast their beans all the time this may not be my first go to coffee shop. I do like that they have a ""secret"" taproom in the back where they brew several beers. Will have to come back to try that out also. It was busy as well though it was barely afternoon.",1.0

The hotel cleanliness I must say is their best feature! There is also plenty of parking. It would be worthy of 5 stars but the room I was assigned had a HORRIBLE view it was literally a wall with bird poop EVERYWHERE! towards the bottom you can slightly see some cars parked but for the most part it was wall and poop outside the window definitely something no one wants to wake up to in the mornings.",1.0

"This place was absolutely amazing! We tried this place because of the reviews from here and we loved it. The staff and the owner are so friendly. Just talking to the owner for a quick moment you can tell how passionate they were to what they were doing. They focus a lot more of their gelato but do have other desserts. 

Their flavored of gelato changes every week. Which is amazing if you're open to trying new things. When we went there we had lavender with blueberry & rose and cream topped with toasted crushed marshmallow which is also made there. Both were excellent! They also offer vegan choices of gelato. Gelato was $3 for a 1\/2 scoop, $$6 for one scoop. I apologize for not having the other prices. Toppings cost extra. Their other pastries are moose cake and macaroons. We didn't try these because they were a bit on the price side for the size.

"Salt Wine Bar is a terrific Iberian tapas restaurant on Ossington at Dundas.   Comfortable ambience with exposed brick walls lines with bottles of wine.  Everything comes as small sharing portions.  Tapas is not normally my favourite style of dining but as Salt it works extremely well.  We've been twice in the past few months and the food and service were terrific both times.  Highlights were the grilled  calamari, the argentinian-style NY strip loin steak and the sea scallops with pork belly.  The bread & olives to nibble on at the start were addictive.  The charcuterie board appetizer was tasty but we felt it expensive for what we got.  The foie gras and chicken liver pate appetizer was good but not memorable.  Unlike everything we ate, the pate had kind of flavourless.  There are so many other tasty choices on the menu that we make a different selection next time.  A minor quibble.  We had a Chilean Carmenere red wine which was delicious and very well priced.  We sampled several desserts.  Creme Brule was very good.  But it was their take on deep-fried donut dough with a dipping sauce that was a major hit.  Even for a non-dessert eater like me, it was incredible.  Service was attentive and professional.  They are trying very hard and doing an excellent job.  Highly recommend it.",1.0

"I have to wonder why New York City doesn't have just one good Cantonese restaurant of this caliber, but it is what it is (as they say here). I went with my family this past weekend on a Saturday evening (Canadian Thanksgiving weekend to put this review in context) and initially had some anxiety as to whether we would even get a table. We walked in and this family of five told us that without a reservation we didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of getting one. They themselves had ordered takeout and were trying to move heaven, earth and a seemingly unsympathetic waiter to get them a table to no avail. I had to start thinking of a backup plan (which meant furiously scouring this app) but to my surprise (and probably to the dismay of that family) the waiters saw that we were three and told us to wait for 15 minutes. Luckily that family had given up and left, otherwise I am sure there would have been a scene. But looking back, another family without a reservation eventually got a table so the comment about not having a reservation may have been a myth. Just to be on the safe side call ahead because this place is worth it.

Now the reviews that dwell on the table cloth a la plastique are correct and the decor ain't some decadent restaurant you'd find in Hong Kong. If that is essential for the dining experience then look elsewhere. I never got the impression that this place was dirty but we aren't talking about a five star hotel restaurant ambiance. It is the food that makes this place worthwhile. I would even dare say I would go to Montreal just to eat here if I was given only one meal (over poutine, smoked meats, etc). Get the hot pot with bean curds and assorted meats. The chow fun with black bean sauce and beef was amazing. If you like Cantonese style Chinese food (which I prefer over Shanghai or Szhechuan), you can't go wrong here. And the price is what makes it so reasonable and worthwhile. The waiter was honest in telling us not to order more than we could eat and that is integrity given he could have not cared, collected on his tip and made us carry multiple doggy bags. If you want good Chinese in Montreal (after you have had the typical Montreal staples) make your reservation today.",1.0

"Overall, a great little store. 

I've gotten to know this Tesco Express pretty well since November, stopping in a few times a week to get little things I run out of, like milk or junk food. This Tesco has it all! Everything I have come for has been in stock every time. And that means something to me.  

Anyway, they are slightly more expensive than other Tescos I have frequented, which from my understanding has to do with the ""express"" part of the store. In other words, convenient = more expensive. Or at least I think that's the logic of it. 

The store itself is clean. There are always several people running around restocking shelves. There is a noticeable security presence at this location as well. Police often park out front. I have witnessed kids attempting to steal and getting busted on several occasions. Hence, why the police are nearby and there is a guard at the door.

The quality of this store is good to me, folks seem a bit down on it for some reason and I cannot figure out why. The place is clean, well-staffed, secure, and keeps items in stock. Isn't that what you want in a store? Besides that, they are open until 23:00, which in Edinburgh is rare as the sun.

"Stopped here for lunch before heading to the airport and this was definitely a good way to end our trip! We started with a wedge salad which was pretty good. Then we ordered burgers...my burger was cooked medium-well and tasted great! We asked for different sauces to try and our waiter had no problem suggesting some and bringing a little extra for us.  We also tried The Fry Sampler with onion rings, skinny fries, and fat fries...they were all great additions to the burger. We ended with adult milkshakes and they were delicious!! Will definitely go back to Burger Bar whenever I'm craving a burger in Las Vegas!",1.0

Came here for dinner on the patio. Great atmosphere  and I absolutely love the patio. They have a massive selection of beers on tap. Which is great for your beer drinkers but they didn't have a cocktail menu for the non beer drinkers. No wine or cocktail menu. Food was above avg. good food quality but lacking in quantity on my sandwich. Could've been a simple mistake but I would get the sandwich again to see if it's the same way. Can't wait to enjoy cocktails on this patio again!,1.0
"Everything about Vegas is over the top.  One of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at Hash House a Go Go.  They are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. I have been to the one in San Diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  Delicious at that.  Going to Vegas, knowing there was a Hash House off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.

We ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  It was milky and ice cold.  The pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  It was similar to the Nutella shake at Burger Bar. The chocolate was a nice background flavor.  Imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. It worked!  Tasty!

The craziest dish I have ever seen was the sausage gravy pot pie.  It had scrambled egg and mashed potatoes which was normal.  This was I guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  The bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  Inside the bowl was massive amounts of mashed potatoes which kind of sucked. There was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    I was looking for more sausage pieces, though there were some.  After a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  I don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  Carb overload is an understatement.

My chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  It had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  The kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the pot pie.  Chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. The eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  Though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.

Hash House a Go Go is a place to go eat.  They make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. This is the opposite of tapas small plates.  You get one big plate, and a lot of it.  The food isn't boring for sure.  They try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. I guess that is the fun of it all.  Vegas is all about buffets, but with Hash House, you will get enough -- don't worry.",1.0

"Amazing doesn't do it justice. But words just cannot describe some moments in life. The eating experience I just had is one of those. I want to rate 100 stars, but 5 is good enough.  I searched ""vegan"" on Yelp, last night and saw a few close to my downtown Pittsburgh location. But Amazing with five stars stood out. So, I have a love\/hate relationship with the Southside. Parking is tough, partying drunk college kids. It's fun though! I love dancing! Today, I decided at noon to stop by and get something for dinner. I currently work 3-11 at a job where food is bleh. Chipotle is the only other option downtown (since they're NON-GMO!!!!!).  I walked into Amazing after reading reviews. Beautiful, open space, well lit, bright, fun colors and decor. Delicious! House made veggie burger, aka Buddha Burger to-go.  It came with roasted seasoned potatoes, sauce on burger, idk what. The best salad ever! Free water with a  hint of lime, dash of Himalayan pink salt whilst I waited. Free wifi. Lovely employees and patrons. I will go back for fresh juices, and smoothies! Thanks  to all the beautiful, perfect souls whom made my day, and meal possible! Heaven is a place on Earth with You Mother Gaia! Fabulous food! Go baby, go, go, go! This is real food. Fresh, local, healthy, truly SOUL FOOD. AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE!",1.0
"I stopped by on Fri., 12\/19 at around 5:15pm with a friend to claim my free birthday milkshake for being on the mailing list (if you're not on it and want a free milkshake on your birthday, sign up!) and to have a snack. I was a bit concerned that there'd be a lengthy wait, but I checked the NoWait app, and to my surprise, it said there was no wait (what?!?).  True enough, my friend and I were able to walk in and get seated right away.

When our waitress came, I inquired about a mint chocolate chip milkshake that I'd seen advertised as milkshake of the week a couple weeks before.  She said they were out of the materials to make it, which was a bummer, since mint chocolate chip is my absolute favorite type of ice cream.  The milkshake of the week for that week didn't interest me, since it involved coconut (I'm not a coconut aficionado), so I decided to order the choco taco milkshake (unspiked--since the free milkshake offer didn't include alcohol) off the regular menu.  My friend ordered the caramel pretzel milkshake for herself, and we ordered the chips and guacamole to split.

As expected, the milkshakes were ginormous and delicious.  They were infused with pieces of chocolate-dipped wafers and pretzels, requiring use of the spoon to eat them, in addition to the straw.  The flavors in both were delicious, with a nice sweet-salty balance.  My only criticism is that there was a lot of whipped cream, which made for a somewhat anticlimactic finish.

The chips and guacamole were pretty good, providing a salty counterbalance to the dominant sweetness of the milkshakes.  The guac had chunks of avocado, and the lime gave the flavor a nice citrusy pop.  While the red pepper pieces provided a pleasant color contrast (see photo), I avoided them, since I'm not a huge fan of raw peppers.

Overall, my friend and I had a good time at this Burgatory, despite just ordering snacks and milkshakes.  (See my review of the Waterworks Burgatory for my thoughts on the burgers.)  I'll have to return again soon to try a spiked shake (such as the burnt almont torte one!) and a burger at this location.",1.0
"Bar Buca is one of my go-to spots in Toronto. Although I have tried all three, this is probably my favorite of the Buca dynasty because it's just so versatile. You can come here at any time of the day (or night) whether it be for brunch, coffee, or some glasses of wine. It's refreshing to have a place where you can go for a coffee past six o'clock. It feels very European. The interior is sleek and modern with high ceilings. The food is simple yet elegant. They have a to-go counter as well. They are even open on holidays! 

Some of my all-star favorites:

--Uove Strapazatte: Mixture of turkey, goose and duck eggs with burrata cheese and truffles, topped with basil and served with grilled ciabatta bread. Spectacular.
---Bombolone: I like them right out of the oven, oozing with lemon & pistachio cream. 
--Zeppole: Again, incredible fried dough filled with pistachio cream 
--Schiacciatas (stuffed focaccias), especially the porchetta one. 
--Assaggi di Pasticceria: two-tiered pastry tower with various goods such as cannoli siciliani, biscotti alla semolina, torta cioccolatino, pizzelle etc. 
--Caprese salad: stylish and creative take on this classic tomato salad where the ""caprese"" is really the sauce.

The seats in the booth are low, be aware, lol.  Other than that,  I couldn't have been more satisfied.

"I've been coming here religiously for my Congee fix the past few years. The real reason why I come is for their Singapore style turnip cakes (+ chili sauce for extra deliciousness). I also really am a fan of their noodle rolls, they make them fresh and you can always watch them make it if you're bored.

In addition, they have a lot of different types of ""snacks"" ranging from deep fried dough to noodle rolls. Obviously, this place is carb filled since its Chinese food, but for breakfast? Who cares?

We got to the restaurant before the 12 o'clock rush, so we were seated very quickly. We ordered a Congee, the Singaporean style turnip cake, plain noodle roll and a deep fried cruller.

"I've always been a fan of the razor because it's inexpensive and pain-free, despite its annoying need of every-other-day maintenance. Meh - the trade off was more than worth it in my eyes.

But shaving my bikini area was a big hassle and NOT as easy as shaving my legs, so last Boxing Day (2014) I decided to take the plunge and go for a Brazilian. Forget about dipping my toes in the water - I'm a tough cookie and figured I'd go all in.

Based on Yelp reviews, I booked Melanie and she was just fantastic. Explained everything to me in detail, had 30 Rock playing and took a break whenever I needed. Because it was my first time waxing (anything), I was unaware you had to trim first, so I'm sure that ramped up the pain level. And though I went in for a Brazilian, I couldn't go through with it and Melanie suggested we stop at a thong-kini instead.

I was all set to see Melanie again tomorrow but because of scheduling conflicts, I had to rebook with Charise. She, too, was simply amazing: super nice, took cues from me in conversing instead of pushing the chitchat, told me why both hard and soft wax are used, and was incredibly quick. I also learned my lesson from the first time and trimmed, and the result was just about as pain-free as one can get from waxing.

So, it's $40 for a thong-kini. Pricey? Perhaps, a little bit. But when I think about not having to bother with a razor anymore and being able to enjoy my thong-kini for about a month, it's well worth it.",1.0
"If you've seen my review on chatime richmond hill, or seen my video rant on it (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C_7wVyrYFZQ&feature=gp-n-y&google_comment_id=z12eyjbzyzm5uh0lh22fjzmpiyn5ijotj) achem, shameless self promotion.. you'd know that I'm not fond of chatimes anymore.

However, this is the only chatime that I'll be happy to go to. The parking lot is a bit small, and I've also almost gotten t-boned when a crazy bitch decided to reverse at 100km\/hr without looking at all. Dear loooord. However, there's also underground parking if you wish to avoid the crazies on a busy weekend. 

The workers here have their shit together and usually move through long lines with ease- which other chatimes clearly have trouble doing. They are also all very nice and friendly, even when they're in a rush hour, again, which other chatimes need to learn from. Chatime bubble tea and beverages are all very consistent and delicious. It's awesome how you get to customize sugar\/ice levels to make a drink to your liking. Some of my favourites are:
- honey oolong milk tea (great twist to the popular original milk tea- no use of sugar, only honey. Tastes better and feels better. No post-sugar depression) 
- QQ jelly milk tea with 30% sugar and less ice 
- Matcha tea latte 

There's not a lot of places to sit here, so usually it's a grab-n-go for me.

"First of all, I love Todd's because the food is excellent, the service is excellent, and it's a fancy restaurant that's locally owned and down the street from my house. I love that they host wine and beer dinners regularly and that the menu is constantly rotating. I also enjoy that Todd has come out and made the rounds every time we've been in. It feels like a true local spot.

However, I have one comment to Todd\/staff. My husband wanted to do something special for his bday this year, so we attended the February wine dinner (apologies for my tardiness in this review). The food was really good (until dessert, which was just ok), but the wines kinda sucked. Also, it was no bargain - at $120\/head, it was one of Todd's pricier wine dinners.

Not sure if it was the fault of Todd or the winemaker, but I think it's tough for anybody to do an entire meal pairing consisting of only zinfandel blends. It's probably my own fault for not doing more research on the winery\/wines to see what we would be having, but I put full trust in Todd. We were treated to scallops (yum) paired with a zin blend (weird). Salad with a zin blend. Salmon with a zin blend, short ribs with a zin blend, and finally a cannoli with a zin blend. Honestly, I tried the last 2 wines just to see if something had changed. I was so so so excited leading up to this dinner. The food and service did not disappoint, but the wines fell way short.

"My husband and I dined at this restaurant last night while we were in Vegas and have nothing but good to say about the restaurant, the service, the food, the drinks and most if all the compassion of all of the staff that were working last night.  We had a very unusual experience and the entire staff came together to help us out. 

It was our last night and we wanted to ensure that we dined at one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants before returning home. We are huge fans of Gordon Ramsay.  We had just selected our food and drinks when my husband had a sudden nosebleed and had to leave to go to the washroom.  The drinks came.... I placed our order........the food came.......I tried to eat  my chopped pub salad (which was delicious).....and my husband still wasn't back.  Our server VERY discretely asked if everything was ok and when I explained the situation he offered to go check on him.  He alerted his Supervisor who also discreetly offered assistance.  After 45 minutes, when the medical situation was under control we thanked our server and as we were getting ready to leave the Manager also came by to ensure that everything was under control before we left.  The restaurant was very busy but the Manager spent considerable time to make us feel comfortable and valued.

driving from LA to Vegas this was our first stop to get food. Heard so much about the buffet so my family and I had to try it out. We did not stay at the hotel, but it is really nice inside, they had it all decorated for chinese new year, it was pretty neat. Anyways back to the buffet ! Unlimited complimentary wine and mimosas... can I get an Amen ?! haha they also had so many selections of food, I felt like I was dining at the united nations for a moment ! Mediterranean, Thai, Italian, Mongolian, American, Soul Food ?! and many more, wow the buffet here has it all. But not only did they have a great selection, the quality of the food was worth paying for. The deli meat that they had tasted fresh and not store bought lol, the crab legs, the shrimp, so much seafood !! my mind was going nuts! but it tasted so fresh. My body hates me for this but they had a big tub of melted butter on the side for the seafood, yeah this place gets more than a 5 star for me.

"I was driving by and saw the banners for Grand Opening of this new Salon.  Since its so close to my house, I dropped in to make an appt for the next day.  The owners did a great job of designing and building this salon.  Some cool unique features like a granite nail bar and all new spa chairs.  
I know the trend these days is GEL nails and they have all the goodies for that, but I prefer standard acrylic.  Lynn listened to all my requests for length and shape and gave me exactly what I wanted.  She is super talented with 3D art and she talked me into some subtle 3D add ons which I love. I have very small and tender nail beds and she was super gentle and artistic with my nail creation.  
Sammy did an expert lip wax and again was perfect and gentle with no pain.
I was glad I asked about lash extensions as they offered me a grand opening special price to try them.  Carrie did one of the best lash extensions I've ever had.  Not too delicate and not too full and fake.  Just the right amount of length and curl and fullness.  They are holding up well too.  I would have paid more than double for this application any where else.  
Overall I felt like a queen with 3 skilled technicians catering to my every need, and competitive prices to boot.  
I did 4 stars instead of 5 as the ambiance was a bit quiet.  I prefer a bit more music and lively ambiance.  But the salon is clean and beautiful.
Lets face it nail salons are a dime a dozen, on every corner.  But give this new place a try as I feel like they put a lot of thought and effort to do things right.  Everyone is sweet and skilled and these guys deserve a chance to show you what they can do.

I tried the burger (no cheese) and fries and this was seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had. The meat was gloriously juicy and beefy. The homemade 1000 island dressing was tangy and delicious. And the soft bun worked to hold everything together. The fries were quite good as well.

I can see why this place is so popular and it is a very small venue so make reservations or be prepared to wait even on a Tuesday.",1.0
"Love this place!  We go here on Sunday's to watch the football game.  Awesome friendly staff, fantastic drink and food specials too!  Where else can you get a $4 bloody mary with a snack to go with it!!  I try something different off the menu every time I go, and have yet to not like anything they have!  And a MAJOR Thank You to Bill the owner for hosting our Steelers group!  We appreciate you!!",1.0

"Five star food at two star prices, what more can you ask for?  Don't let the fact it's in a strip mall fool you, this is a very nice restaurant, albeit smallish.

"4.5 stars! These guys make the best coffee in the neighbourhood in my opinion. Bonus points for roasting their own beans.

I come here quite regularly as I work down the street. Even though it is farther than the other coffee shops in the area, I am willing to go the extra block as the coffee is delish. My preferred drinks of choice here are the lattes and cortados. Only drink I've had here that I wasn't a huge fan of was the Iced Latte, but that might just be because I should have asked for skim milk (I find it's too much milk flavour otherwise). Price wise it's fairly reasonable for the area. Plus they offer double shots of espresso for drinks at no extra cost, so if you like it strong this is the spot! 

Food wise I recommend any of their daily baked bars (rhubarb was amazing!), tarts or the almond chocolate chip biscotti. Not a fan of their croissants unfortunately - I prefer a more flaky texture, but they are huge! They also have mini pizzas and quiches for those looking for something savoury. 

Lots of seating available (there is more in the back). Free WiFi. Never too noisy here too so I'd say it's a great spot to have a meeting or work away.",1.0

"Let's be honest, I want to be proprietrix Jessica's BFF.  From her amazingly talented hubs, Chef Luca, to her world travels and taste in wine, she is the girl to know.  Everything we tasted was beautifully presented and delish.  The atmosphere oozed upscale and even the babies having dinner in the back room were chic.  

The wine is hand selected and pairings are encouraged.  For special events, reserve the Chef's Table with friends or try a blind folded meal.  Great for private events, large groups or an intimate dinner.

"I initially found Michael on Avvo.com searching for asset protection attorneys in las vegas, nevada. He was one of many that I decided to contact regarding asset protection. He was surprisingly prompt with his responses and was easily reachable via phone, unlike the other attorneys that I contacted for an initial consultation. He also has several tips under his belt that others did not even know existed because they are so new that other older lawyers would care less to learn. His recommendation\/referral to his go-to banker also made things easy. I could have gone online and used legalzoom.com  or rocketlawyer.com, but that would have been a huge mess. There's more to asset management than just using pre-written legal documents. Looking forward to further services as my business grows and really appreciate the prompt responses from Michael. Do you own research to see if he's a fit for your endeavors, but I would not even hesitate to recommend him to my friends and family.",1.0

"I stumbled upon New York Cafe for a quick lunch on a Monday.  By quick I meant my parking meter was expiring in 40 minutes.  I ordered an In-House Roasted Beef Sandwich, no fries ($7.25).  It turned out I didn't need the fries.  The sandwich was a half submarine.  The roast beef was moist and fresh,  It was approximately half an inch thick.  The gravy was salty, making it tasty for dipping.  The bun could be fresher though.  In all, I enjoyed the sandwich.  It was good diner quality food at food court price.  It made a satisfying, delicious lunch.  I won't mind ordering it again.

The services was great.  There was only 1 waitress, and she was a real pro.  She wore a big smile.  I was greeted and seated promptly.  I told her I was in a hurry.  She acknowledged it, and a glass of water appeared on my table lighting fast.  The roast beef sandwiches arrived within 10 minutes.  When done, I asked for the bill, and it arrived within 3 minutes.  I walked back to my car, and the meter was not expired yet.

A few things I would recommend, the Maggiano's Salad with a delicious house dressing and crispy prosciutto, the mussles with red sauce that is spicy and sweet and makes you want to pick up the bowl and drink it! The flatbreads, bruschetta, sausage and peppers, stuffed shells and chopped salad are also top picks. 

Even if you are feeling like you need to unbutton your pants as the server asks you if you would like dessert, say yes!! We ordered the mini sampler and every little delectable sugary bite of creme brulee, apple crostada, chocolate zuccotto bites, tiramisu and cheesecake were perfect.

"Reading the reviews for this place cracks me up, mostly because they are all true, the 1 stars and the 5 stars...too funny. 

Yes, the biz operates in a very counter intuitive manner, I mean come on, cash only (they do now have an ATM at the front, after 70+ years in biz...), no restroom, the employees are anything but friendly, even when they call your number, they say ""24"", not even ""number 24"" or ""now serving..."" just the number, and in such a disgusted tone. And nothing but outside seating in the scorching heat (although they do have misters)? 

But really, would any other tactics do this place justice? The place is nasty, in a nasty part of town, what, should they have spent some money unnecessarily, given the place a little spit shine, made it pretty, trained the staff to be more chick fil A like? No across the board, their biz is perfectly in line with the totality of their circumstances.  

Now, where I do disagree with the 1 star reviews is the food. It may be nothing more than ""glorified fish sticks"" accompanied by ""watered down ketchup"", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried. So five stars for the food! 

My wife gets so angry because this is my chosen place for birthday lunch each year. I must admit, there is a component of nostalgia to my five stars and that would be due to the re-enactment of cherished moments of my youth (as I shed a lone tear...) because Pete's was one of the few strong holds that continued to offer Dr. Slice after many others stopped. Anyone remember Dr. Slice? How they ever stopped making that, I will never know.

My girlfriends that live in Buckeye had been here before, and wanted to take me and our other girlfriend while we were out visiting, and I'm soo happy they did!  What a cool, unique little spot!  The perfect place for lunch and margaritas on a hot Arizona afternoon!  

This is a huge restaurant, and when you walk in they have a nice little area with palm trees and a walkway that leads you to the main restaurant and their duck\/turtle pond!  Its inside this little courtyard, and the seating is all around this neat pond area.  There were lots of mallards around, and also at least two different species of turtles sunning on rocks and swimming in the water!  Also they had a little station where you could buy feed for the animals, just put in a quarter and you get pellets to feed them!  When we did this, we saw there were also huge koi fish living in the water as well!  Very beautiful and large fish, really cool to see!  

Anyway, about the restaurant...we asked to sit at a table by the water, so we waited a bit, but decided to go to the bar and get margaritas...they were REALLY good!  My margarita was definitely top notch, and it was perfect to chill in this nice little room by the bar while we waited for our table.  Once our table was ready, we got chips and salsa, which were also very good...I really liked their salsa especially, it tasted like it might have been homemade?  I ordered their Plato Burro, fried, with chicken, and it was good.  Came with rice and beans, and did have a lot of chicken in it which was nice.  Typical Mexican food, but good!  Our server was also very sweet and friendly, and was quick with drinks and food as well!

Visited phoenix first time and decided to visit this sushi restaurant based on others review. Definitely a good sushi restaurant. Quality tasting fish and not fishy at all. Portions are generous. I ordered 5 piece nigiri plate w\/ roll and gf order spider crab roll. Highly recommend the nigiri plate for those who enjoy raw fish and dislike eating imitation crab\/fried ingredients. The raw fish was served well thawed that it tasted creamy ( cuz we all sushi eater should know that raw fish must be frozen first to kill bacteria and thawed enough that you can taste the full texture and flavor of the fish w\/o the fishy flavor). The servers were very attentive as well as the chef. He gave everyone a complimentary seared tuna and fried yellow fish tempura which was delicious. Experience was excellent and if I were to visit phoenix again I would definitely eat at this sushi restaurant.,1.0

"Connie is great at what she does. I have been getting my hair colored for 10 years and she did one of the the best root touch ups ever & definitely THE best in the states! She matched the color perfectly and you can't even tell where my natural black roots (a little over an inch) had been after she was done, which is how it should be! 

I have gotten color and root touch ups done at various salons in New York City (where I'm originally from), 2 other salons in Vegas since I've moved here, and in Taiwan while on vacation. Needless to say, I have encountered my fair share of colorists \/ hair stylists. The absolute best color \/ root touch up I've had done was in Asia in Taiwan, but I don't think it is fair to compare since they tend to have better and higher quality products there. Connie is definitely the best I have experienced in the US.

I found Connie on Groupon and even though her cut, color, & deep conditioning deal was sold out, she offered me a great first time customer deal ($65) and opened early just to squeeze me in for a Saturday AM appointment when I called to inquire & schedule on Friday!

The cut was great and above average as well...I would say an 8\/10 and one of the top 3 cuts I've ever gotten. I asked for layers to lighten up my hair a bit since it was super heavy, thick, and tangly from growing it out for my wedding for the past year. The layers and style look great but I do feel she took a little too much off with the layering. However, that is my fault for not stopping her and communicating better since I did say I felt my hair has gotten too thick and was weighing down my head a bit.

The icing on the cake? Connie is super friendly, down to earth, and positive. She makes you feel like an old friend the way she engages you in conversation without it feeling fake or forced as is often the case with salon service providers. I will definitely be back! Thanks Connie! :)",1.0

I ordered the fish tacos which were delicious but wish they would have come with a side. My husband ordered the burger which was on the small side for his liking. The fries on the side were a divine throwback to my grandma's homemade fries. All in all a nice place. Not kid friendly. Prices are high for lunch but considering the area, I guess it's normal.",1.0
"Awesome! I took my husband here for his birthday. I made a reservation a couple of weeks in advance via OpenTable. It's cool that they have the people dining on a lower level than those drinking\/eating at the bar so everyone has a view of Pittsburgh. It was a clear night so we could see Pittsburgh's beautiful skyline even though we didn't have window seating. You will be stuffed by the time you get your entrees and even more so before you leave with the popcorn and bread to start off before your meals! Nonetheless we ordered the charcuterie to start off with and everything is from local\/Amish businesses - delicious and then my husband had the pork chop which was ginormous! and I had the duck which was tenderly cooked, it melted in my mouth with each bite. I wish we had room for dessert because the options looked good but we received a treat to take home from the pastry chef - a piece of toffee bar. Modern vibe which makes Altius standout from the other places on Mt. Washington - a place for something special or a night out on the town!

The only downer was that I called the day of to see if they could accommodate two more people and the person on the phone seemed rude about my question but it might have been that there was a lot going on.",1.0

The cut and color are amazing. I came in with a VERY rough idea and a couple of pictures. He and I chatted about what I was looking for, then I let him run with an idea we discussed. I was excited before he was even finished and that NEVER happens for me with haircuts.

"Basically like all the other Winking Lizards (check my review of the other WL for more detail), but this one is probably my favorite. Great location, right off the towpath. Nice outdoor patio with great scenery. They also have a cool little cellar bar that is usually open, but can also be reserved for private parties.",1.0

"Just got a ""new"" Jeep Cherokee (new to me anyway) and it is due for an oil change\/30K mile service. After being quoted an absurd amount of money from the dealer I started what I expected to be a tedious search for a local, honest and knowledgeable shop. I stumbled across USA Auto Service on Yelp and called Chris after seeing so many positive reviews. The price he quoted was extremely reasonable and the lobby is filled with long time customers and referrals from long time customers. I am very satisfied and am confident that I have found a place that I will return to time and time again!",1.0
The chicken teriyaki bowl I ordered was more than enough and really good. The flavor was good and chicken was cooked perfectly. Stopped in for lunch and the wait only a few minutes which is great!

"I just happened to run across Jeniza one morning when I was wanting a manicure and it is about 5 blocks from my home.  Mary was the tech there and took me right away.
I have been to many salons both expensive and less expensive and never had such a perfect manicure. My nails are thin and fragile so she was very careful when trimming and filing and  I usually have to go home and clean up the polish but her job was perfect. I have never had anyone that paid so much attention to detail.  Her pedicures  are  also ""spot on"".  I see her every week sometimes my nails still look good but I love visiting with Mary.  She is such a good person  and I truly appreciate the way she has made my nails and feet look.  I have found a home.

I got four different pastries- a caramel and dark chocolate tart, which was perfect- not too sweet, and beautiful; a lemon meringue tart, which was lovely; a cannele, which the friendly man who packaged up my treats helped to pronounce properly (my French is pretty much non-existent); and a delectable croissant. Then, as I was signing my receipt, the cashier suggested I take a sample of their marshmallows. I decided on the spot to buy a bag of the vanilla marshmallows, but he suggested I try the raspberry. Totally amazing! I whipped out my credit card right there and bought a bag. I wish I didn't live 4000 miles away, because I already want more!",1.0
"Still my favorite Mexican food in the valley. They have unique family dishes that you will not find in any typical Mexican restaurant. If you are looking for the basic burrito, enchilada, or chimichanga...do not go here!!! If you are looking for traditional regional flavors done right by the family that owns the place, then do come here and you will have some great food. I have been a fan since the first time I went there and will continue to visit when I am in the area. For all of you nay-sayers....wake up and enjoy some traditional Mexican food and get rid of those Taco Bell mentalities! Los Sombreros knows how to cook god food!!!",1.0

"Whenever I visit Vegas, I always make it a point to try a new burger joint.

B&B is a burger restaurant with a beer garden.  A fairly decent selection of craft beers, but I came here for the burgers.  And a solid burger, it delivers!

They have a handful of burgers and I opted for ""The Morning After"" since I have an affinity for egg on my burger.  Who doesn't love egg on their burger?!

Good burger overall.  Patty cooked to order.  Well possibly a tad rarer but that is fine with me just don't overcook it!  Good meaty flavor in the patty.  But the truffle aioli was the clincher and tied everything together!  All the different parts worked together wonderfully!  Just ask my stomach!

My only complaint?  The patty was smaller than my liking.  Only a 6oz patty...  For me, an 8 - 9 oz patty packs the right-sized punch of flavor.

Good burger but still not worth a repeat visit anytime soon with many burger options in Vegas.

Everything came out really well it reminded me of McCormick and Schmicks. It was cooked to perfection. Also tried the Gumbo and it was spicy and good but I think the clam chowder is much better. They also make a great bloody mary, the spice was good but they came in short glasses.",1.0

They also left me sitting and soaking in the bowl for over 30 min before someone started my service. This is why I didn't give 5 stars. However, I absolutely loved the finished product and artwork.  They also have a photo book of nail art you can look at which is great.  Price is great too!",1.0

The guys running the place are really easy going and there's this sense of community among its people who are here just having fun and playing boardgames and video games. We saw how comfortable people were in exchanging hellos and introducing themselves to others at different tables. Very nice vibe here, all in all.

"Big flavor. Big portions. Head to Island Flavor Express!

People who lived in Hawaii are blessed that Vegas is the 9th island. You don't have to go far to get some Island grinds. The newest addition to Henderson is located in the shopping area on Eastern Ave & Pebble. 

Same owners as Island Flavor on Durango, they are a casual place-order\/pick-up order or take-out service style restaurant. The staff has been incredibly friendly on each visit and the place is clean and simple, with about 6 tables inside. 

Food I've ordered:

Furikake Ahi Poke
Hawaiian-Style Poke
Kalbi Ribs
Furikake Chicken & Shrimp

Furikake Chicken - Let's cut to the chase. I don't even eat chicken. The batter and glaze they use is insane, I couldn't help but try a few pieces that were just crumb batter. OMG. Sweet and salty deliciousness! My boyfriend and toddler loved it, too. I tried the shrimp version, and they over-fried it, so I wasn't as happy with it. 

Poke - The portion they give are great. The fish is cubed into good sizes. However, I can't say it's the best I've had. The fish tastes good, but I prefer the poke to have been marinated longer. Melt-in-your-mouth kind of poke...

Kalbi - Ridiculous portion and the meat is tender! Look at the posted pictures below.

Desserts - They have a rotating selection found in the fridge by the door, so you can self-serve and take it to the counter. I have yet to try any, but I've seen Chantilly, Haupia, Guava Chiffon, and Coco Puffs. They also stock Hawaiian Sun canned drinks.

Look at their chalkboard for their daily specials. They serve Lau Lau on Fridays and I've seen Mahi Mahi and Kalua Pig posted, too.

This has become one of those regular stops I'll make when I want some quick but tasty Hawaiian eats for the family. I'd love it if they could start serving oxtail soup and malasadas! That's the only thing I can say they are missing. But I'd highly recommend stopping by if you're hungry in Hendertucky!",1.0
"This is the second out of what will be MANY times ordering from them.  Got a pepperoni pizza and two sandwiches for delivery at 11:30 pm last night.  I don't remember the pizza being so amazing last time but wow, we devoured it!  Just perfect amount of everything (although the bf was just certain I ordered extra cheese.  Nope, it just came that way).  The sandwiches were had today and WOW.  Tons of meat inside and what makes a sandwich an awesome sandwich of course is the bread.  The rolls they use, actually the whole style of the sandwich reminds me of how they come back in NY.  Open late, super fast friendly delivery.  Tip the awesome driver!",1.0

"One thing about Burger King that is great is that they serve ""Veggie Burgers"" that are actually quite tasty. They sometimes have you pull over in order for them to actually cook said burger but in the end it's worth it. Their whopper jr's are good and their fries aren't too shabby either. I feel they excel in burgers. Their chicken tenders\/nuggets and sandwiches could be better but are edible to satisfy a hunger.

I was once given free cinnamon rolls (or something like it) because I was in a drive-thru for longer than expected. That was a pleasant surprise!",1.0
"I've finally had the chance to get back to this place and try the full menu. I, unlike others here, am not all that familiar with the chef who runs these restaurants. I will say that my last meal at his fancy and pricey, L'ettoille was pretty terrible, and although I've tried Graze twice, I was not all that impressed. James Beard or not, you have to bring something more impressive to those two places in my opinion. They appear to be resting on well-established reputation than on truly excellent dining experiences. This place, however, I'm in love with, and feel that this is indeed this chef's forte. This restaurant has a local farm to table angle which is unusual for this type of cuisine. 

On the most recent visit we brought a party of four which allowed us to try numerous dishes. The restaurant itself is divided into a casual noodle bar with a view of the hard-working kitchen, and a more formal space with a full Asian-fusion menu with Korean leanings. 

We started with two table snacks, the spiced peanuts and the beef jerky. We were all craving more of the peanuts very quickly. The jerky was delicious and had a nice spicy bite to it. I've had Thai beef jerky at other places and I'd say that this one could be a little less dry. It was delicious though. These were paired with a couple creative craft cocktails that would, on their own, bring me back.

We moved on to:

Kohlrabi Salad - carrots, cherry tomatoes, apples, long beans, shrimp, herbs, peanuts, tamarind sauce

Kohlrabi is a somewhere between a turnip and cabbage and is also known as ""German turnip"" or ""turnip cabbage"". This salad was delicious and had us all scraping up ever last bit of it. One thing that should be noted in the description is that the shrimp are the little dehydrated shrimp that you find in Thailand. They add a nice, salty punch to the salad. This was sort of a creative twist on a Thai green papaya salad.

Next up:

Cheesy Ddeokbokki - rice cake, lap cheong, Bandaged Cheddar, Pleasant Ridge Reserve, crushed egg, kimchi, gochujang

One of the most unusual dishes I've come across in a long time. I'm a huge fan of Pleasant Ridge Reserve cheese so had to see how it was incorporated into this dish. This was a hearty, cheesy tribute to Wisconsin by way of Korea. Really good, and bravo on the creativity shown.

Bibimbap - meats of the day, vegetables, rice, fried egg, ssamjang, served in a hot stone bowl

Perhaps the most recognizable of Korean dishes, Bibimbap is a heated stone bowl filled with rice, veggies, meat, etc. An egg is then cracked over the top and cooks by virtue of the heat of the dish itself. This one was spot on with super fresh ingredients. Delicious. 

Pork Curry - spicy red curry, beans, pickled garlic, crispy shallots

Wonderful, although I did add a bunch more spice using the unique Kim-Kim sauce they keep on hand. I would prefer that they ask how spicy I'd like it. This was too tame for our tastes.

We cooled our mouths with some wonderful homemade soft-serve ice cream in unique flavors like balsamic and basil. 

Service was a bit too casual (as in the waitress didn't know the menu well and was a bit scarce). 

Overall, BRAVO. This one hits it out of the park. When back in Madison, I'm heading right back here.",1.0
"Just moved to Ohio from California, so I've tried many high end sushi spots. I have to say this place shocked me so much because the quality and the flavors were phenomenal!!

"I guess this is my local, so I can't believe I haven't reviewed it before now. This place ain't fancy, but it fits the bill if you are popping in for a pint. I usually have a Foundry cider which is on tap. I have only eaten here once and it was on a Monday night for their wing special. I think it was $6 for a pound of wings which I thought was good value, and most importantly, the wings were tasty. The atmosphere is laid back unless there is a live act which can get a little busy and loud though it is still a preety decent venue.",1.0
This place is a must try. I would say it's a bar you can bring your kids to if you have any. The service is great the food is better. Me and my girlfriend got pub fires with cheese and bacon to share. I got the Angry tiki and Chili dog she got the Pot roast and Big Ben  all on beef franks. The food came out in no time and with a bill of only 35$ including a beer it was a great price. They also have a massive beer cave in the back. Next time I stop in here I have to bring a group of friends so we can all try one another's food.,1.0
"I was craving some cookies, and I found this place on yelp. I purchased their vegan chocolate chip cookies, organic sugar cookies, and pecan chocolate chip cookies. They were all extremely good.

"This was my second time in two weeks visiting this restraint and I had a blast. My first time was on V-day and I absolutely loved the lobster salad appetizer, it has roasted hazelnuts in it, yum! I got scallops for an entree and they were okay but not better than the lobster salad. My second visit I got the roasted vegetable salad and I must say it was one of the most elegant plates I have ever seen. The beets, watermelon radishes and feta\/yogurt\/pine nut puree was to die for!!! Again, the entree, trout dish, was not as good as the appetizer.",1.0

"Came here for dinner with my wife and daughter. It was delicious. We were quite hungry and ordered lots of food for the three of us to share. Spring rolls, fresh rolls, chicken satay, papaya salad, stir-fried red curry with peppercorn, bell pepper, onion, green bean, basil, seasoned veggies, and chicken (H 4), and Beef Ta-Krite, a stir-fried beef with lemon grass, chili paste and string bean (H 6). Everything was SO good, but the spring rolls (and yummy sauce) and H 4 stole the show. Highly recommended! It is a tiny, family-run restaurant run by super nice people. We will definitely be back.",1.0
I like authentic Mexican Food since I am Hispanic. I have to say that Barrio Queen exceeded my expectations. I had the chile relleno and I absolutely loved that they didn't bread the chile poblano. It was filled with veggies and the flavors were a delicious combination. Atmosphere was great and the service was outstanding. We will continue to go there.,1.0
"5 Star Rating for Best Way To Move!
We hired Best Way to move a home in Toronto, the move was from Thornhill to Richmond Hill. They called ahead to confirm the time of arrival, showed up on time and the 2 gentlemen that came to do the move were very professional and organized. The move went smoothly, all as planned and we were very happy with the service. We will certainly use them for future moves.",1.0

"Woodlot is always in my top 3 in Toronto. I would recommend it to my friends, parents, colleagues, and a perfect stranger. I love everything about it. Being seated in either the chefs table, which is literally in kitchen surrounded by pots pans and baking trays, or upstairs in the intimate and cozy dining room, you feel at home. The food is always a 10 out of 10. My go to is the flat iron steak and the pork chop but I like to dabble in the separate vegetarian menu and pretend I'm Italian by ordering a second course of mouth watering pasta. Their wine list is often an interest read, I like the tenacity of the sommelier to pick wines that are out there, interesting and from regions you didn't even knew had great wine. Service again is always fantastic, consistent. 
If you haven't been, you must, you won't be disappointed! Thanks for some of the best meals of my life Woodlot :)",1.0

"I finally got to experience the wonders that is The Yard. I attended an event for the PT profession here and I had a great time. To my understanding, The Yard itself is the area where there is Corn Hole, Pool, Jenga and all the other games. Culinary Dropout and Barrio Urbano are two different restaurants that are attached to the Yard and you are free to move about the entire complex and order food while sitting outside. Pretty nifty concept if you ask me.

There were multiple bars around the entire space so it was not too difficult to get a drink. The food and drinks were good and everyone had a lot of fun mixing and mingling. My only complaint is that the parking sucks. Your options are valet, limited street parking adjacent to the restaurant, or parking in the other small lots across the street. If you luck out with a parking spot great, otherwise you may have to brave a sprint across 7th Street hah. Definitely a spot to check out and a place that I will visit again.",1.0

"Guaranteed Dental Solutions are the best group of people I have ever seen in a dental or medical office. From the moment you call to the dentist, and even checking out I have never meet finer people. They work with you for everything. I have a great fear of dentists which is pretty common, but the receptionist was wonderful and spent time talking to me and making me feel comfortable. After making the appointment, I told my husband about them and he decided to go with me. I had my teeth cleaned by another fine person who made me so comfortable, and then saw the dentist. He was so gentle and never made me feel bad. He listened to me and did not try to push a more expensive way down my throat. He gave me my options and that was it. I spoke to the woman who then takes care of pricing the work you need and they made it work for me, I was in tears. When you realize you can actually afford to get work done that you have been putting off. After my whole experience my husband then booked his appointment, he was so impressed. If you are hesitant or worried about payments don't wait another minute go and see them, best decision I have ever made.",1.0

She's always looking out for me, and thinks about things that I couldn't even dream about, considering my weird financial situation and whatever things I seem to be getting myself into.

My colleagues brought me here when I was on a work trip and I loved the concept. I believe there is a hotel upstairs? Don't quote me. I got a bowl of Chipotle Carrot soup and the Truffle Mac n Cheese. It was PERFECT since it was Toronto wintering pretty hard outside. I added Sriracha to my mac and it was the best decision of my life. I was pretty stoked that they had Sriracha in the first place. I was expecting some Tapatio (ew). The service was ok. Not great but not bad.,1.0
"The view is absolutely breath taking! Watching the sunset over the mountains while having a decadent dinner was super romantic. 
Chef Mel greeted our table and the service was superb. The servers were as excited talking about the food as we were to eat it. 
We started with the foie gras. It was perfectly seared and the savoriness was nicely complimented by the sweetness of the peach pound cake and rhubarb chutney. 
Next we got a seared scallop, compliments of the chef and servers. It's hard to find well executed scallops and these were superb! The sear on the outside had a nice crispness. 
I had the Chilean sea bass. The kitchen definitely knows how to cook their fish. It was moist and flakey  with a good char. The potato risotto was on the cusp of being over seasoned but was silky and melted like butter. 
My partner got the cut of the week which was a bone in filet. It was cooked to perfection. The squash and mole complimented it well. The lobster mac and cheese was made with havarti. It was deliciously creamy. 
We got the chocolate soufflé for dessert. My partner really loved it. I am not a fan of chocolate but I can only imagine it's the stuff chocolate fanatics dream about.

"Amazing experience. One of the best things I've ever done.
My adrenaline was pumping for hours after this experience. 
The instructors here are really great. They first take you around the track twice in a Porsche Cayenne to show you the turns. Then you get in the car of your choice to do your own laps.

A few initial tips:

* Go early.
* Play Gran Turismo before you go with the car you want to drive (good practice)
* Make sure to do 10 laps. Anything less is just not enough.
* Make sure to be prepared to do an extra few laps for a little more money after you're done (good day of deals to add more laps)

I had Kenny as my instructor and he was great. He was giving me tips the entire time, yelling out how to go faster or slower based on the turn and adjusting my driving as I go. These guys must be even more nerve racked than you since they could be dealing with horrible drivers. Thank god I'm a great driver! I was almost too careful in the beginning and the instructor said to go even faster which I did. Somewhere along the line, I got my track laptime down to a minute and a second with the Ferrari F430. If I do this next time, I'd like to try the Lambo and the GTR.

"No one does Tuesday nights quite like Postino. The Tempe\/Annex location is a prominent social hub as evidence by the inclusive crowd (coworkers, significant others, prominent fixtures, etc.; seriously, Chris Newstrom, was that you sitting across the bar?!) who have made the weekday pilgrimage to the Annex. Even from a distant parking lot you can hear the muffled chatters of people rubbing elbows with one another. 

Inside, the atmosphere is fast-paced yet intimate and evocative. Do yourself a huge favor: situate yourself at the bar, get cozy and ask for Mark (great server, bartender and all-around nice guy).

Selecting a bruschetta board is largely preferential, but try the smoked salmon with pesto, as well as the brie and apples paired with a cabernet sauvignon.

The Il Bastardo ($6.99) sandwich was good but simple.  I think I would go for something slightly more complex next time.  I will say the prices are a little high considering the size of the sandwiches, however, for the more obscure options, it seems to be worth it.

"If you're in The Beaches and looking for a great little take out place, you can't beat Delina's. The restaurant itself isn't much to look at - it is pretty spartan, but is clean and has a couple of tables to eat at. The food, however, is great and reasonably-priced. A wide variety of middle eastern dishes are prepared freshly on the premises. As a vegetarian I am thrilled at the number of yummy salads and vegetable dishes they have to offer. And the rest of my family quite enjoy the different shwarmas and other meat and fish dishes they have on the menu. The serving size on their mixed plates is pretty generous. The owner is a lovely, friendly, hardworking lady who creates all her dishes from scratch. I would recommend giving it a try.",1.0
"I was nervous to walk in here because it was buzzing and obviously the ""it"" place near Eaton but I was looking for a fresh salad so I gave it a shot. The hostess was incredibly friendly and made me feel completely comfortable. She offered a sample of the house wine while I looked at the menu and made it clear that even though I would be taking up valuable real estate on the patio--the last table (and it was for four) that I was most welcome. Wow! The quinoa salad was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced for the quality, quantity, and freshness--I could not finish it. I would go back and highly recommend this high-energy spot.",1.0
"My GF, sister, her boyfriend, and I came here to watch Block 16 perform and we had an absolute BLAST. Not only was the music amazing (a WIDE variety of music that got everyone up and dancing or head banging at one point during the night), but the service was beyond what I expected for a dive bar. Our bartender - Penny, I believe - was the most amazing bartender I've ever encountered. She let my GF try Crown Royal Apple and an IPA before letting her decide what she wanted. When we asked if the bar sold cigarettes rather than having to buy them out of the machine (we didn't have cash), she gave us her pack instead. Oh and they serve Micheladas, which is this Mexican girl's dream!

The waitress from our table was so much fun. She would come serve us, go dance across the dance floor and hit the next table. And she was an older woman, which made it even more fun. She took really good care of us. Truly, we enjoyed our time. I'm hoping that Block 16 will perform there more.

"Food was great!! Both had the $8.99 Soup, burger and cookie special. The tortilla soup was SUPER! Burgers were hot and yummy however messed up one of the orders slightly.

We got the sundae bar as well to split one and it was fully stocked with serve yourself scooped ice cream and a mixed bag of condiments.  Cookies were fresh and chocolate melted in your mouth. 

Only complaints are that one burger didn't come out as ordered with requested toppings. Also our server spent more time chatting with friends and paying attention to a business meeting eating in rather than us and we were seated first. Didn't bring my Arnold Palmer to the table until after I reminded her, even though the other table was served three times.

First off, the decoration of the place matched my dream condo : wood, bricks, and green plants. It was beautiful, very modern! Loved it!
The crowd there was all business people, seeing as we were there for lunch and it is located downtown.
The service was excellent; we didn't wait too long for our plates, compared to other restaurants in the area that have a very slow service during lunch hours because of the rush. The waiters were very friendly, with smiles on their faces the whole time. We were thanked by three different waiters when we left!
The lunch menu has nice options at an reasonable price and they come with a bowl of salad and a bowl of noodles to start. I took the Jatoba salad which was very good; the salmon sashimi in it was very tasty. My boyfriend had the beef teriyaki on rice and veggies; it was really good and cooked perfectly. I have to say that I preferred my boyfriend's dish, but it might've been because I was very hungry and wanted some meat. Anyway, we exchanged our plates with each other halfway through, so in the end, I was satisfied!
The dessert menu looked really good and creative, but it was too pricey for a lunch so we skipped that part of the meal (anyway, I had already planned a dessert for the birthday boy!).
I will definitely come back for supper to try different dishes and all the desserts!

"First time visiting this place after hearing about it for months. For ambiance, I would give this 5 stars. It's small, intimate and has a downtown charm to it. I would add that it's self-seating and we arrived at 7pm on a Friday night. We got a table right away but it was at the bar where my wife and I were outside and our 2 friends were across from us but inside. Still kinda fun!

The food was perfect. We built a meat and cheese board and they have great options, very comparable to Postino, if not better. We also ordered the Italian combo flatbread which was perfect. Their wine list is better than Postino and I had the Malbec. For dessert, my wife had the gelato with dulce flavoring and it was divine. I ordered the tiramisu. They only had one slice left (this was around 8:30pm on a Friday night so slightly disappointing). I share that because my friend's husband wanted one too. We ended up sharing it and our server added a candle after we all joked about the two of us sharing an intimate slice of tiramisu.

"YUM! Their omelets are huge (6 eggs). You can get a baby omelet which is half the size, but it's only $1 cheaper so definitely not worth it. I would suggest just sharing the regular sized omelet. (They charge $0.95 splitting fee which is definitely not bad.)

Omelets come with homemade chips (YUM) and choice of bread. Choose the pumpkin bread!! So good!

Omelets are about $10-$12... But are HUGE and shareable. 

KITCHEN SINK: omelet with basically everything besides the premium items (seafood, avocado, etc). This was really really good!!! And even included chilli which made everything better. GET THIS. 

LOBSTER FEST: omelet with lobster, cheese, and avocado. The lobster was really good and they are definitely generous with the lobster. However, I wouldn't order this again. Lobster is a pretty bland flavor in general, so is egg.... Making the omelet uninteresting. The individual components of this omelet were good, but all together, it didn't fit well. 

JACK OF ALL TRADES: burger with guac, lettuce, tomatoes (also comes with homemade chips but no bread). Surprisingly really good as well!!!! I liked this better than my lobster omelet. $10",1.0

Much like Coldstone, you pick which ice cream you want and select different add-ins.

They have a live band area, daily specials, and roughly 15 different Fat Head brewed beers that change frequently...everything from drinkabke, lighter brews to 9% ABV ""knock you on your ass"" beers. Bumbleberry is a crowd pleaser and it come with fresh blueberries which are an adorable bonus. Seasonal  Spooky Tooth is a ""punchy"" imperial ale with a hint of pumpkin pie. How could you go wrong with a beer named Spooky Tooth?!

Food is phenomenal, and reasonably priced (around 10 bucks for an item) Something for everybody from healthier, contemporary items to pizzas and gormet burgers. All home made in house. 

The only con is that it can get pretty busy, and the small area fills up fast, so get there early for dinner if you have a bigger party or don't want to wait.",1.0

"I used El Cheapo for the first time to move from condo to condo in downtown Toronto. They arrived when they were supposed to (I had the first move of the day) and were very understanding as I ended up having elevator issues in both the condo I was moving out of and the one I moved into. One mover was even trying to help me deal with the elevator problem at the new condo which was nice.

I got 3 guys for the price of 2 (it was the first day on the job for one of them). Overall, I thought they were quite efficient and even with my elevator problems it only took 1h45m from start to finish. Without elevator issues I would say it would have taken 1h15m to 1h30m.

"Aw Yeah, my reaction when I heard they were adding a Henderson branch of Navy Fed. I was introduced to this Credit Union 5 years ago. I was with old Wells Fargo, that charged monthly fee to keep my money in their bank. So it was a no brained to go with Navy fed which required no monthly min balance and NO FEE's to keep your money in their bank :D. When I moved to NV I was saddened to find out that the closest Navy fed was in North Vegas. So I was doing back flips when they announced that they were opening one right down on Sunset. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They have a FREE coinstar type machine that deposits your spare change right into your account (with no fee).

I take my dog here for daycare, and every time I pick her up she is happy and tired, just the way I like her. They also give me feedback if she had a exceptionally great day or if she had an off day, so I know they are diligently supervising the pups in the daycare!

For all you plus size girls looking for a wonderful place to go for some very intimate services I highly recommend Salon D' Shayn and seeing Courtenay Weitzel. I'm a bigger girl and would love to get Brazilians done on a more regular basis but it has been so hard to find a place that I really felt comfortable. Courtenay made that experience amazing for me. Not only was it way less painful then I thought due to her techniques but she was so friendly and talkative she made me feel completely at ease. I am in love with this place and finally found some where I can truly walk in and have no embarrassment or concerns. I can not praise the service or Courtenay enough. THANK YOU!!!,1.0

He served me one drink months before and he remembered who I was, to some that may sound creepy but to those of us who do this for a living that is being great at your job!!

"Recently, Matt repaired my carbon fiber road bike frame.  It was a small nick on the rear dropout on the drive side.  A local bike shop recommended I try a local ""Phoenix Frame Repair"" shop, when I mentioned I wasn't willing to deal with the hassle of stripping and shipping the bare frame.  When I compared pricing, Matt's pricing was comparable to those in California, except not strip and ship fees.  This was over the phone estimates.  I spoke w\/Matt on the phone and he sounded sincere, plus he said won't need to strip the bike as the damaged area appear small and out of the way (I sent him photos.)  He met me in a local shop near where I live and I gave this stranger my beloved bike without a receipt, just a hand shake outside of an unknown bike shop (to me)!  It's like the old, old days when business can be done with a hand shake and not feel like you'll be taken for a ride to the bank, or worse not get your little steed back. A few days later, Matt send me update on the assessment before the actual repair (agreed time for the following Friday so I can ride it in the weekend).  His assessment was a minor repair and paint for a fraction of the original quote!  I was very happy!  That Friday, I picked up the bike at his shop, a bit of a drive, but not too bad. I couldn't tell the repaired area, except for a slight difference in the paint -- difficult to match.  I was extremely happy with the work Matt had performed!  I have been riding my bike for several weeks and can't tell a difference from before the repair.  I still talk about his quality of repair whenever the subject of cycling comes up, or when talking about excellent service and integrity, etc.

"I usually go here for lunch with co-workers or for a quick bite after work.

Pros:
+ great slice of pizza
+ large slice for decent price

Cons:
- no great sitting down
- slices vary in size

Food: (4.5 stars)
Amazing thin crust pizza.  I have been there a few times, and they were always making fresh pizza.  The slices are large, 2 will get you full, 1 is enough if you are looking for a slack.  The whole pizza is around $20 and it can feed 4 adults.  
Note that if you are getting slices, since they do everything by hand, the size of each slice will be different.  


Service:
They accept credit cards, and are friendly.   Since there is no waiter service a bit harder to give a detailed review of the service.  Never had issues with anyone working there.  


Ambiance: (2 stars)

Short menu but packed with flavour. 
Adequate wine list with many wine by the glass. Amuse bouche, complimentary from the kitchen that changes frequently. What's not to like about this place? 

My only critique would be that the menu is short ... Almost too short, only 4 options for both starters and entrees.

Friendly staff and excellent food! Hugh portions, food came in hot. We started with the ""bread in a cup"" that was so yummy it had a cinnamon roll like texture! I had the steak and eggs chilaquiles, steak was a pretty good size and a perfect medium rare. Chicken and waffles were yummy too! Best piece of chicken I've tasted in awhile. Large piece deep fried crunchy coated chicken breast. This place does breakfast right. I'm assuming this is family owned which is great because they really care about the quality of the food.",1.0

My best friend and I are regulars here and we absolutely love it, I recommend it to any sushi fiends like myself.",1.0
"My family and I come here often for shabu shabu. It's tucked away in the same plaza of SF market and right underneath Bazic. The layout of the restaurant is somewhat off. All the tables are scattered everywhere, but it's nice to be able to sit at a 8-top table when it's only the three of us. 

Service can be a hit or miss. The times we've been there, it's been a miss. The place was busy and attentiveness lacked so much that we got up to get our own condiments that we asked a few times for. Sometimes, even getting a menu could take a awhile. There was also a time when they forgot about our rice and I waved my hand in the air, but the staff that looked dead at me just didn't care. I was like damn he's faking the funk game is stuuurdy, real sturdy. It can get frustrating at times. When the service is a hit.. it's a wonderful experience here. Everything comes all at once, drinks are refilled, rice is given without being asked. So it's all about chance here.

We usually get the Kobe Chuck, hungry portion that comes with a small amount of sliced white onion, mushroom, tofu, cabbage, broccoli, green onion, and udon noodles. I love their dipping sauces which are a ponzu-based sauce for your veggies\/noodles and the goma sesame-based sauce for your meat. I add the minced daikon, garlic, and green onion from the condiments selection to my ponzu sauce to intensify the flavor. I also add garlic and green onion to my goma sauce to give my meat the same effect. Delicious. If you don't get your white rice or condiments by the time your meat and veggies are done.. Ask for it! 

I highly suggest to avoid the soy milk broth. There isn't any flavor whatsoever and it's so translucent that it's almost all seaweed broth with a sake shot of soy milk. I was looking for more of a heavy cream based broth as in all soy milk not half or a shot of. I stick with the Spicy Miso Broth, which has the most flavor from the three of Seaweed, Spicy Miso, and Soy Milk. 

The technique for shabu shabu is to you its own. I prefer to use half my tofu\/cabbage\/mushroom\/broccoli portion, all my white onion\/green onion, and save the udon noodles at the very end. While the veggies are almost done, I swish one by one my Kobe Chuck slice, then dip it in the goma sauce and get a veggie.. dip it in my ponzu, then combine both (meat\/veggie) with my white rice and there you have the magic of shabu shabu. Lastly, I save my udon noodles for the broth that had everything boiled in it. Think seasoning the broth for a soup ;)

Shabu shabu is soul food at its best. I always leave here with a smile on my face. It's therapeutic, yet fun at the same time. Love the music they play here. Top 90's, Reggae, and some old school like Sinatra got me movin' while I'm swishing away. Keith Sweat - I'll Give All My Love To You... Ready For The World - Love You Down just to name a few. Dining here with music that I love is a plusplusplus!

"I've used Active Renter for the past two years. I have a few rentals here in the valley, and decided to use a property manager to help me with the properties. If you're looking for a property manager. Rich Hoey is your man hands down. He gets thing done and takes away the headaches from the property owners. 
 If you're a renter looking to rent form Active Renter. Please remember this is a business. Just like renting from an apartment there will be a lease and different deposits. Just like any other business. Unless your renting directly from home owners. This protects the owner and that's why we hire them.  

The complaints I see are from renters. Some of you forget that the owners are vested in these property's. We depend on the rent as our income. You don't pay your rent, I may not be able to pay my mortgage on the property.  My properties are my retirement. I really don't want to lose then to someone that wants to not pay.
I've hired Active Renter to take away these headaches, so I don't have to do credit checks. Deal with AC problems, or leaky sinks or collecting the rent. That's why I hire Active Renter to do these things for me.

"Ughhhhhhhhhhh. I wish I was able to comment on other reviews. 


Yes this place is chipotle STYLE.... But 100 times better. And just in case all you yelpers didn't know... Chipotle was previously a subsidiary of McDonald's. Last time I checked McDonald's isn't usually the healthiest choice out there. 

Honestly I come here at least once a week. I can't say enough good things about this place. My 2 year old son doesn't like meat. But every time we get the fish from braddahs he eats it all!! And some!! Food is always fresh, the staff is always friendly, portions are always large and the price is reasonable. I've been going here religiously for over a year now. Chipotle has never tasted the same.


For those who say the food is greasy here.... You probably got the pig. Which is not greasy but fatty. Because it's PORK. And it's slow cooked.

This is the only one I go to because we always receive the best customer service and our food has never been wrong.
On this night my friends and I went for a quick meal before going to piranha. We ordered the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta (I HAVE to order this every time) it has a little spicy kick, the chicken, shrimp and red bell peppers are what makes this dish my favorite. I can't get enough go try it. I believe it's $15? I also ordered a raspberry mint patron drink. Very good but I wouldn't recommend it with the pasta- too much acid. This drink was $10 probably would've been cheaper to just get a drink at the casino! Lastly the only flaw I have is that if you don't sit at the bar when they have their half off drinks, you don't get them- unless you walk to the bar and pay every time. They should just make it half off no matter what I'm sure they would sell more!
Lastly I want the endless appetizers back!",1.0
My wife and I had dinner on a Tuesday night and were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding service. I ordered the flat iron steak and my wife had the salmon. Everything was cooked exactly as ordered and was delicious. The steak was one of the best I've had at that price range (under $40). My wife's salmon was the best either of us have ever had. The entrees took longer than expected to come out but our server took care of us by comping a slice red velvet cake for us to share. We will definitely be back.,1.0
"I originally started with a three star opinion but I'm hopeful about this place enough for a bonus point. Three stars on a clearly popular and well done spot seems harsh.  But here's the deal.. A cocktail menu at a restaurant needs to have drinks I can sip on with my meal. I ended up ordering the Ruby Queen--beets and vodka, mostly--and I have no idea why I thought that would work out well.  It was super vinegary; I was not prepared for an entire rocks glass of that (although of course I still drank all of it eventually). The cocktail menu is rough on Station for me. Most of it is creative, but includes negroni, manhattan, things that shouldn't take up space on the six or seven option menu.. Especially when there are some expectations from Grit & Grace's super extensive (and delicious) list. Yikes.

I've been eating small basket tastings from Station for the past year at every local function and was always a fan. That has not changed, but I get less excited as the night goes on here. +1 and I spilt the heirloom tomato salad.  It was complete with the super acidic earthy vibe (AND ALL THE DILL!) I've had at each preview but with a pretty little presentation. It was enough to buffer as our food took a little extra time.
My crispy chicken was good.. Cooked well. Tender. But I'm a gal for seasoning and wished I had some Trader Joe's 21 Salute on me. That's a little disappointing. Luckily, the lil' dirty bread pudding had enough flavor in a gooey little square for the whole plate.
+1 had a burger that he was waaay too into. What else is new. The fries which I stole all of were great though (like, really really great).

I'm definitely coming back to the bar (one of my fav 'tenders is now here!) to give the menu another swing--I'm sure it changes often enough--but might give the food some time before trying again before taking another Gamble (get it, get it). I'm sure this is going to grow to a favorite.",1.0

"We noticed Spoon from the street when we were visiting Edinburgh. It was Burns night and it looked busy and fun and they had nice Art Deco windows and old lampshades.  We came the next day and had the chicken and clapshot and the celeriac, potato and parsnip gratin. I admit I was a bit underwhelmed when I saw the menu (and the lack of meat options) but the food was so delicious I'll happily eat my words. The savoy and red cabbage the gratin was served on was crunchy and buttery and although the gratin looked small it was really satisfying and the rustic menu felt wholesome in a non-holy way. The decor is fun, higgledy piggledy charity shop chic - if you're lucky enough to find a charity shop full of Ercol :)",1.0

The talent was outstanding. The band is comprised of ex members of well known bands. My favorite was the female singer. She has an edge to her voice that fits perfectly to rock music. I will be checking to see if she does her own show somewhere in the future. While it got off to a slow start, the band of accomplished musicians warmed up quickly to Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Hendrix, and more. Lucky for us we saved a few bucks getting a 50% off local deal but at any price this was an enjoyable show complete with special effects and dancing in the aisles.",1.0

"I love coming to fogo to get my meat fix on. Been here a few times and just recently figured out that lunch can be had for 30 vs 50 for dinner for all the exact same foods, but the only problem is that it's difficult to go back to work when you're fighting a food coma! If you've never been the red\/green card controls whether the servers come around to give you meat or not. 

Fogo has tons of cuts of beef, pork, lamb, and chicken! My favorites are the beef ribs that you usually have to request, the filet mignon\/rib eye, and lamb chops. I usually skip the chicken and pork cause they are not always super tender and every time I've had the parmesan pork it's been a little tough. 

The salad bar is well stocked as well with various cheeses and and cured meats and smoked salmon as well and provides a nice break from the meat. They also have a few hot items on the side such as the pao de queijo (cheesy bread) that is awesome and I really enjoy the caramelized bananas and polenta as well!",1.0

She helped me design something over the phone that I hoped my daughter's teacher would love.

"For all the thin crust lovers out there, this is your place! For the deep dishers...you probably will not enjoy this place.  The crust is perfectly crisp and thin, with a nice crunch with each bite.  This is like the subway of pizza...you go down the line and pick your items. For $8 you can put ANY TOPPING on your pizza and as much of it as you want!  The service is amazingly fast, with the pizza coming out in less than 10 minutes. I mean really, where can you find such an offer?!  I opted for two sauces on mine, herb butter first and then alfredo on top.  But really, you can split the pizza in half and have two totally different sauces....the options are limitless.  I can't remember the exact combo of all the veggies and meats I put on there, since I got a little greedy and picked almost everything.  Like other reviews, yes they are a little skimpy with the ingredients at first, but I just asked them to put more of whatever I wanted.  They were happy to oblige, without any complaints.  The only one minor issue I had was with the sausage.  I like Italian sausage with a little pepper\/heat, but the sausage here seems a little bland.  I honestly can't wait to come back, thin crust pizza is my favorite and now I can have it my way every time, without paying extra for each additional topping!",1.0

Located in The Cosmopolitan, and offering a lunch deal long-hailed as one of the best in the city, it was finally on Saturday afternoon that I sat down at a posh four-top in the center of Estiatorio Milos and with both old friends and new gathered 'round telling stories of food and travel one only wonders why it had taken so long to finally stop by.

Formally decorated, with white tablecloths and good cutlery surrounded by an airy Mediterranean theme with balconies overlooking The Strip, it was after a small mistake at the hostess podium that seats were located and although service seemed stretched and perfunctory due to the noon-time crunch the three course format plus one supplement proved timely in presentation - each plate arriving with precise plating and appropriately temperatured, the pasta particularly notable as it was served still-steaming hot.

Beginning with crusty bread and fresh-pressed olive oil rich with grassy funk, it would not be long before Milos Signature appetizer would arrive and although seemingly nothing special in its ingredients the crispy layers of eggplant and zucchini were simply irresistible surrounding a core of tangy  tzatziki while four pockets of lightly battered Kefalograviera proved a significant upgrade on any other local 'fried cheese.'

With three of us opting for the $10 upgrade Octopus at course two while the fourth instead invested in Meze, suffice it to say that this is one place where the upgrade is well warranted and with each bite of charred cephalopod tender beneath the blackened grill marks both onions and capers served to compliment, rather than overwhelm - a rarity for both ingredients, the olive oil infused with their flavors immediately commanding more crusty bread.

Again biting on the upgrade, this time $15 to put a whole lobster atop the aforementioned house-made noodles, it would prove impossible to find fault in either the portion or flavor of the tender crustacean's flesh and although simple grilled fish generally is not my thing, the Mediterranean bass was also exquisitely prepared while shrimp were unfortunately overcooked and overwhelmed by sauce, the large-grain cous-cous instead stealing the spotlight on a friend's plate.

To this point more than a little impressed by Milos' cuisine, though a bit off-put by a frequently empty water glass, dessert was a simple decision between three options and with two opting for tangy Greek yogurt draped in fruit myself and one other opted for the dainty walnut cake, itself texturally compelling and just-sweet-enough while the mint tinged ice cream proved a pleasant juxtaposition in flavor despite a texture slightly marred by some sort of binding agent or gum.

Undoubtedly a lunch bargain, particularly given its location and dinner time price, Estiatorio Milos is one of the rare places where refined food can still be found for lunch on Las Vegas Boulevard - a veritable steal for the $25.15 three-course prix-fixe price (excluding upgrades) in pleasant environs that feels miles away from Sin City or the Casino floor.",1.0
"This place was delicious. Typical family style Chinese place where you order three or four things and share everything. We had orange chicken, fried rice, and cashew chicken, all of which were fantastic. 

We also had wonton soup and potstickers. The potstickers were perfectly cooked for my liking (tender with a crispy side) and the wonton soup was full of good stuff, rather than a bunch of broth with a few pieces of chicken. 

The staff was helpful and quick, despite being busy. (We went on New Years Eve so there was a lot of takeout orders).

They seemed to have an efficient process for the takeout line, but we really enjoyed eating in because they brought things out right when they were ready. They were staggered in timing which was nice.

All in all, it was a fantastic experience. They deserve the 5 stars.",1.0

I don't specifically have a favorite because all their foods taste amazing but there kabobs are definitely worth it all. Sadly, I don't have a pictures of my food to share with everyone because I instantly start devouring my food when i get it before I can even take a picture. I know some people say the service here is quite slow and not the best but in my opinion and experience the staff and service has been absolutely wonderful to us. The only bad thing is that the wait time for our food is sometimes long but the food itself makes up for it. Overall, I highly recommend this place and you definitely get your money's worth of food!

"We went for a Monday night happy hour at the bar.  This location opened in the last week.  The space is very similar to other Uptown locations.  It's a big, clean space with a bunch of windows and a lot of gray.  There's a decent sized bar on the far wall with a kitchen behind.

I've never been to the original seasonal Dynomite in Playhouse Square but have had a couple burgers at the Progressive Field stand.  They've been well-done but tasty.  This location has a full bar as well as an expanded menu with sushi.

I didn't really get the happy hour. There was a discount on well drinks and wine but I wanted a beer with my burger.  The ""happy hour"" beer was a $4 Sapporo... same price as the menu listed.  The friendly bartender agreed they need to work that out.  I would let that go because of what followed.

We started with an order of $5 buffalo wings.  Three tender complete wings, with flats and drumettes attached, coated in a buttery buffalo sauce- they were delicious and a great value.

The burgers... Awesome...  Each on the menu is a gourmet concoction, most named after other Bruell endeavors. We had a Kafeteria and Cowell and Hubbard.  I ordered mine mid rare and that's how it was delivered.  The beef was top notch but what made them to me was how the ingredients worked together.  The sauces on each were outstanding.

The $8 burgers were a decent size, not enormous but just enough for a meal.  Other sides are a la carte.

This is, quite literally, the single luckiest thing that has ever happened to me in my entire life. The chai was the best I've ever tasted, and the sandwich was prepared on the most incredible bread.

They have really great sandwhiches, soups and sides,  my favorite is the macaroni salad, also they make a delish Italian sodas!

But out of the many times I've been to this place I've gotta say that the lamb pulled noodles is hands down the cream of the crop. The soup base is rich and definitely the most flavourful out of all the ones I've tried.

"I usually get my salad fix from Earth (formerly known as Toss't) but after reading the reviews here, I decided to give Simple Ingredients a try for lunch today. I was greeted warmly when walked into the little place and I didn't feel rushed as I looked over the menu to decide what I wanted. I was feeling more in the mood for salmon than chicken so I choose the Super Foods Salad with the tomato basil dressing. The people behind the counter were personable and while I my salad was being made, I learned that this place is owned by the same people who own Sal's.

As one other person on here pointed out, there is no seating in Simple Ingredients (part of what makes it so ""simple"" I suppose) so I took my bagged Super Foods Salad to my office and enjoyed it at my desk. My first impression was how fresh everything in the salad tasted. The tomato basil worked well with the spinach, kale and edamame and the serving size was just about right. I was really surprised by the slice of bread that I got with the salad. It seemed stale... very uncharacteristic of the rest of the meal.

It seems to me that there are mainly two salad joints in the Downtown area both competing against one another: Simple Ingredients and Earth. Let me contrast the two. 

Simple Ingredients seems to have slightly fresher produce than Earth does; but only very slightly and maybe I just caught them on a delivery day. Earth on the other hand offers strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries, something that I really enjoy with my salad and I kind of missed them today. I think you get a slightly larger serving of salmon and it comes in one piece at Simple Ingredients but I like the way Earth crumbles it up for you. Also, Earth applies and mixes the dressing of your choice for you which is good if you're going to consume the salad shortly after purchasing it. Whereas Simple Ingredients gives you a tub of their dressing and you can apply it when you see fit. Good for those purchasing now for later. 

Both places have their pros and cons but all in all they both produce a very good product and there's enough of a market with the Downtown crowd to support them both.",1.0

"A very cool new coffee shop enters the already strong Edinburgh coffee scene. Bare brick walls, a healthy option of cakes, loud music on the stereo (but a lot of old school stuff, which I like) and friendly baristas that have a taste for waist coats. Nice. Oh, and good coffee, of course.

I know they have beans that aren't Artisan Roast or Square Mile (both of which are awesome beans, but what Edinburgh doesn't need is another coffee doing the same as all the other coffee shops). They get their beans from all over, I wish I could remember where, but I know the baristas are passionate about coffee, tasting, and latte art particularly (one day I got a wee rose in my flat white, very cute). Basically, they do good coffee, they're passionate about coffee, and they're bringing something to the Edinburgh coffee scene that's a wee bit different bean and taste wise.

They also are now doing milkshakes and iced tea through the aeropress (I think?) They get their cakes from an amazing bakery, their soup and sandwiches are from Union of Genius, and they have free wifi. These are all good things.

I like it a lot here. It's long and narrow with bare bricks, but the big window half way down brings in natural light, and the happy tunes make it a happy place to be. Nice wee addition to the South side!",1.0
"This hidden gem is wonderfully delicious. Ordered from appetizers to entré. Everything is great. Great service, great food, great environment. Can't complain about a thing here. Even their bathrooms are sparkly clean. Heard They're moving to another location soon or renovating. Better call ahead and ask. Duck confit and their pasta in beurre sauce is mind blowing. Worth a try If you're in the area. Something different for date night.",1.0

I had a craving for pizza after I was done with work, so I dragged my boyfriend with me to Giana's.  This pizza shop is a cute little joint, it reminded me of some of are smaller ones we have back in NYC. We ordered a pie, and it was ready fairly quick. The pizza was pretty delicious, you could tell they use a good quality cheese and dough, plus their tomato sauce was flavorful.

"As the Duke, I can't go on without writing a review about all the amenities this gym has to offer.

LVAC North located off the 215 and Durango and is one of the top gym facilities in the area. The new gym is clean, with sparkling new machines with the latest and greatest technology. Some machines even create a rocking momentum making workouts more enjoyable. 

The main feature on the first floor is the swimming pool, (yet to be open) men and women's restrooms with steam room, showers, and saunas. A designated workout area closed off for women only, a large room that coordinates group workout classes and food service located behind the front entrance. I have yet to sample\/try the food they sell. As a bonus, a Yogurtland is situated on the west side of the building. Also, for a $12 fee LVAC offers daycare with cameras in bathrooms where parents can monitor children and have a sense of relief knowing their children are in good hands. 

The second floor offers tons of free weights, cardio equipment, racquetball and huge TV screens. A running track is available, making it worthwhile to run during hot summer days. (6 laps = 1 mile) In addition to the group workout room downstairs, there is another room upstairs. The classes offered in both rooms are helpful with motivated instructors and create high levels of synergy. As a personal favorite, the group classes motivates me when I feel unmotivated.   

Overall LVAC has more benefits than negatives. Yes, LVAC gyms can get hectic, people don't wipe down gym equipment, but in comparison to other gyms it's has more to offer at a reasonable price that won't break the bank. 

Finally, additional services like towel service and personal trainers are provided at an extra cost. One of the biggest complaints LVAC is notorious for are complaints about contracts and monthly dues. To avoid that battle, I paid my membership up front therefore avoiding a contract altogether. It has turned out to be a better deal for me.",1.0
Wonderful customer service.   On time and did an excellent job with repair and installation.  Definitely will use when we do our bathroom remodel.,1.0
"I needed a new mattress, so I headed over because I saw a sign advertising a sale on queen sized mattresses. I'm on a budget, so this sounded like a great plan. I went in, and the salesperson was helpful and not at all pushy. I tried out the inexpensive model, and it felt pretty good in the store, so I bought it. I was in and out in about 20 minutes. Delivery was scheduled for a window between 9 and noon a few days later.

When I bought the mattress, I was told that I had 100 days to try it out, and that if I didn't like it, I could return it and would get a refund, minus a $150 restocking fee. The delivery drivers came right at the beginning of the delivery window and were done in just a few minutes. They were polite and professional.

Unfortunately, mattresses aren't always as good in real life as they are in the mattress store. After a few weeks, I decided that I didn't really like the mattress. I went back to the store to arrange for a return. Since the mattress was really inexpensive to begin with, I would have only gotten a few dollars back after the restocking fee. The salesperson worked with me and was able to discount the restocking fee so that I still got back about half of what I paid.

The delivery drivers came the next morning, once again at the beginning of the pickup window, and hauled the mattress away.

Even though I ended up not liking the mattress, the entire process was hassle-free, and I feel that I was treated like a valued customer.",1.0

"Yum! I have been wanting to try this place forever but I don't go all out on breakfast (and sweets) too often, so I had to find the perfect time.

I am from LA but I have NOT been to the original - shame on me, huh?
This one did not disappoint, though. The portions were RIDICULOUSLY huge. I got the room service pancakes (something like champagne, chocolate, strawberries) and they were amazingly delicious. Did not even fit on the plate. I also had an omelet with a baked potato in it, which was a nice savory contrast to the sweet pancake breakfast and also just as huge. The prices were very reasonable and service was attentive. It is a bit loud inside, but not necessarily a negative.
Oh, our table also ordered the red velvet pancakes, which were amazing. They had the signature red velvet frosting on them (cream cheese) and were so much like dessert, it was unbelievable. 
I would definitely recommend  this place, particularly if you are feeling extra hungry, or maybe, hungover. I didn't get any, but I saw a few people with pitchers of drinks and I was a little jealous :P",1.0

"I can't recall how many times I've been given the run around by mechanics throughout my life. I'm sure a lot can relate.  This Independent owned Midas. The Manager Keith,  The Amazing Mr Mike.

Keith and Mike will not bullshit you. Had my alternator on the brink of destruction that could of landed me stranded. They saw this while fixing my broken AC unit and showed me what a good alternator is supposed to look like, and then showed me what MY alternator looked like.

We started with the Hot and Sour soup. It was filled with lots of pork and other goodies in a rich broth.  Absolutely delicious! 

Our main courses were Mongolian beef and Sun Devil chicken. The chicken was my favorite- lots of slices of chicken breast with bell and jalapeño peppers in a delicate yet spicy sauce. The beef was loaded with tender slices along with onions and scallions in a flavorful brown sauce. Yum!

Complimentary fried won ton strips with sweet and sauce as well as a bowl of hot mustard were provided as we looked over the menu. The owner also brought us two free egg rolls part way through our meal.

Last time I shared the profiterole dessert with my friend and it was quite tasty. It had popcorn in it, which added an interesting flavor and nice crunch.

"Le meilleur brunch de Montréal

Oui je proclame L'Avenue comme étant le meilleur brunch de tout Montréal. Et à y réfléchir, je dirai même le meilleur brunch de ma vie. 

Aucune réservation possible, s'applique la loi du ""premier arrivé, premier servi"". Toujours le line-up à l'entrée, mais bon ça vaut définitivement le coup de patienter. Une fois à l'intérieur, un autre univers s'ouvre à toi. Un mur en briques recouvert de graffitis colorés, une moto et un scooter suspendus juste au-dessus des tables, de la musique vive et rythmée. Et le clou du spectacle: des toilettes éclairées à la lumière bleue dont les murs sont aussi recouverts de graffitis.

À revoir: Les serveurs sont pressés et peu aimables, et l'attente pour être servi est scandaleuse. 

Le menu peut s'apparenter à un livre, compte au moins 10 minutes pour assimiler. Beaucoup de choix, tous plus appétissants les uns que les autres. Et quand enfin vient le moment de déguster, c'est la consécration (considérant le nombre d'épreuves pour y parvenir). Un effort notable est fait sur la vaisselle de tendance moderne et sur le dressage des mets tout en relief, ce qui décuple l'envie. Un positionnement plutôt rare: les plats offrent de la quantité ET de la qualité, non mais c'est fou ça ! Tout est succulent et en toute saison, même les fruits (dans une région où les fruits sont insipides, ça relève carrément de l'exploit). Des associations osées, des goûts marqués, des assaisonnements équilibrés. J'apprécie particulièrement les pommes de terre rissolées bien relevées qui sont un exemple pour la société.  

Mon coup de coeur: ""Steak & eggs"" 2 oeufs Oméga 3 pochés, émincé de steak de bavette Angus Black et champignons réduit dans une sauce chateaubriand et nappé d'hollandaise épicée, accompagnés de patates rissolées avec brochette de fruits.

And the pinwheel steaks (when available) are awesome! And try the store-made meatloaf!

"If you don't want to faint from sticker shock at Crop Bistro, Crop Kitchen is a nice alternative. You'll probably average about $10-$15 less per person at Crop Kitchen. I came here with a large group of friends and had a fantastic time, mostly because the ambiance is perfect for a faux-fancy night out with buddies!

The service was unbeatable with informed and funny waitresses, totally armed to deal with the never-ending-questioners-about-menu people in my group and the vegetarian and vegan folks' requests. 

I enjoyed that the daily specials were projected high up on a chalkboard. I've always hated listening to waiters go on and on about daily specials--who has that kind of attention span to listen to every spice and garnish used in a dish? I'm a bigger fan of reading the specials for myself. 

As for the food, it was pretty darn good. I had the Fire Roasted Uku special of the night. This fish was FREAKIN AMAZING. It came with lentils and tomatoes soaked in a coconut curry. DELISH! The fish was pretty mild, so it's perfect for those that don't like strong fishy flavors. The curry was the perfect balance between sweet and savory, and the portion size was just right. Definitely a hit! I also sampled some of the eggnog bread pudding that a friend ordered and thought it was creamy and decadent. Definitely wished I had ordered it too! 

The only reason I'm not shelling out 5 stars is because my drink, the Uptown Punch, was just a downright disaster. I was expecting coconut and pineapple flavors and instead was greeted with a heavily alcoholic concoction with little to no flavor.

"I love a good dosa. And I am slightly biased towards South Indian food, it's my favourite. Tanjore does dosas very well, and I think is run by a South Indian family so the food is very authentic and perhaps almost as good as you'd get in Mysore or Kerala.

Dosas are large, thin, crispy pancakes made with lentil and rice flour (so they're gluten free). The best, more traditional one, is the masala dosa made with potato and onion and spices. I had the mysore masala dosa, which had the addition of some spicy red tomato sauce along with the potato. And the dosa my friend had with paneer and peas was really delicious too! The meat ones, like lamb, are also great, but I find Indian food to be really satisfying when veggie, all those good spices!

The dosas come with some coconut chutney, coriander chutney, red chutney (not sure what the ingredients are but its good!) and sambar (a small lentil-based veggie curry). The whole platter will cost around £6 - £7 and is incredibly filling and satisfying!

The restaurant is small, the waiters friendly and it was bustling and a happy, tasty place to be on a Sunday night. But I would recommend booking! We hadn't, and had to wait 20 minutes for a table (although they were very accomodating in trying to find us one).

"I can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review about this place.  As I write this review the word PHENOMENAL keeps repeating in my mind.  I live in southern California, yet I make it a point to dine at this place any time I am in Vegas.  We have great dining options in San Diego County, yet we always reserve a special dinner for Andiamo.  What makes Andiamo so special?

Customer service is the first reason that comes to mind.  John was our server the first time we dined here and did a great job.  We had the pleasure of Carl helping guide our second meal here and have made it a point that he takes the reins of every dining adventure at Andiamo since then.  With his knowledge and passion for food and wine Carl has the ability to make our dinner an epic one.  Impeccable service, a great sense of humor and an attitude that makes us feel comfortable and welcome.  The hostesses Roxanna and Elma are always sweet and very accommodating, even when our party is running late.  The manager Ulisis makes it a point to visit with us at least once every meal.

Now for the tasty treats that encourage us to eat until it hurts...

Drinks: Great wine list with enough variety to accommodate anyone.  Bottles 212, 234 and 226 were very good.

Appetizers were great.  The fresh bread with eggplant caponata is a must try.  Over the past few meals we have ordered the imported meats and cheeses (Great with wine), crab and lobster ""Louis"" (avocado mousse ties this together perfectly), steamed mussels (light and just enough white wine and garlic) and sausage and peppers (very tasty with al little spice).

Salads were great.  Tried the table side Caesar (very lightly dressed) and Martha's Vineyard salad (bold flavors).

Entrees have been phenomenal.  I have tried several steaks, and all have been cooked to perfection.  I always pair them with the balsamic glaze and chipollini onions.  I have also enjoyed the veal osso bucco, veal all' Aldo and Sea Scallops entrée.  Lobster risotto, Fruitti de Mare (So much shellfish) and tortellaci have been my wife's favorites.

Desserts are ridiculously decedent.  From the Andiamo Kit Kat to the must try Italian wedding cake.

"J, myself and the two dogs had a great morning of hiking around Calico Basin but came out starving. Thankfully Lazy Dog is super close by and has a great outdoor seating area that's dog and human friendly :) We frequently order a few small plates\/appetizers to share and today was no exception. They have a great selection of those so it was easy to make that call.

The hostess initially wanted to seat us directly next to a table with a small, white dog who yapped a bit when we initially walked up. We asked to sit a bit farther away. I've read about this happening in other reviews too. Our server was Derek. He was a bit preoccupied cashing out other tables before getting to us, but it was understandable and actually appreciated by us. We had a bit of time to look over the menu without feeling rushed (because I really don't like that!).

We ordered the Shrimp Ceviche Tostadas, Chicken Lettuce Wraps and Sweet Potato Tots. J also ordered an Arnold Palmer and I actually ordered a drink for once- the Jamaican Lemonade, a recommendation from Derek.

The Arnie P was below average. It seemed like the tea was un-sweetend, which is fine, but unknown until the first sip. J wasn't impressed. My Jamaican Lemonade was delicious and a real treat for me! There's a lot going on, but the flavors come together nicely. I thought it'd be coconut milk based, but it came in a little shooter and you squeezed it in (or maybe you're not supposed to?) and gave it the perfect hint. 

Tostadas were decent, not a whole lot of flavor going on. I wish they had put some kind of salsa on the side. We probably could have asked, but they already give you full size Sriracha bottles if you ask for the sauce (!!!!!) and I was content with that. CLW were awesome too. I didn't try to sauce that went with it, but they had great flavor, as did the cucumber salad that came with it. Tots were a solid choice as well.. But they are just tater tots so not a whole lot to say there.

All in all, it was a great meal after time well spent over at the basin. I even forgot my portable water bottle and they were sure to save it for me in case I remembered! We'll definitely be back- Thanks again, Derek!",1.0
"This is a nice little place with great empanadas. They have a variety of savory and sweet offerings -- the sweet ones have an option to add ice cream and chocolate sauce. They appear to have several kid- and vegetarian-friendly offerings.

We have lived in Mesa for a long time, but this was our first time here. The location is a little off the beaten path, but we agreed that is was worth the trip. There isn't a lot of parking in their lot, but we went there when it wasn't very crowded and did not have any trouble.

As some others have reported, I think a normal person can probably eat 2-3 empanadas for a meal -- I'd suggest 2 and +1 for dessert, especially given the interesting dessert options. For the savory options, I also recommend using the salsa verde that they give you. It just seems like the right thing to do to brighten them up a little. Maybe not the Hawaiian one, but the others for sure. My kids had a bean and cheese and a cheeseburger empanada and enjoyed them. It was a nice touch that each different kind came in a little paper bag that was stamped with the type. They all look the same and that keeps things organized. If you order multiple of one type, you get one labeled bag containing several of that type. 

I had the Pernil, which contained some roasted pork that was very good -- moist and tasty, especially with a little hit of the salsa verde. I also tried the Boricua, which had the same pork, but also rice and some kind of peas in it, I think. I liked this one the best. I had the platter, and found the rice to be cooked well, but a little boring (salsa verde to the rescue!). The fried plantains were perfectly cooked and very tasty. 

For dessert, we split the Fig, Cheese and Caramel (Well, that one ended up being all mine since everyone else thought it sounded ""weird"") and the Ruiz's Pieces with ice cream and chocolate sauce. The Ruiz's Pieces is Nutella and peanut butter, and I have to admit it was the star of the show. The Fig, Cheese (Mozzarella) and Caramel was good, but I didn't think the flavors blended together as much as I would have liked: the ingredients were stacked\/layered in the empanada with the caramel on the bottom, figs in the middle, and cheese on the top. It was definitely worth a try and interesting, especially if you like something a bit off the norm, but it was a little challenging to ensure that you got a bit of each filling in every bite.

Also going with two can be better as to order different main courses so you get to taste more. But the stuff Quail is king. I'd order that again and again. Let your date try the other haha.

Fast forward to about 15 minutes with no one coming back to the tables about beverages or my question about the wine. All of sudden, one of the main courses arrives and she leaves before we have a chance to ask what happened to the appetizer. Couple of minutes later the second course arrives. Upon asking she says the appetizers are being made right now and will come out when they're ready. Good thing we didn't order dessert because that might have come out first! After we are halfway through, the appetizer suddenly shows up. We finish everything and half of the plates are cleared away and 10 minutes after that third and final course shows up.

"I would love to give this more stars, the food is good but used to be great. Not sure if they changed owners or what the problem is but the last 3 times we ordered it was delivered and was not right. One night we had to call back 2 times as the calzone dough was raw. Each time they say ""would you like us to remake it""...well um yeah that was our MEAL! Then they always want the wrong item back, kind of insulting like maybe we are lying to get free food. Not aware of any other delivery place that does this. Spoke with the mgr this time and he did remake it and said we could keep the mistake. At this point we probably won't order again, 3 strikes your out. Bummer because they do have good pizza.

"Unbelievable...the first time we came here we had a horrible experience where we had someone name drop the owner of the casinos to get in on their reservation on time when we had been waiting for ours for 35 minutes. After my yelp review I was contacted and comped a meal which I really appreciated. We have since come back and had no issues until today when I talked this restaurant up to our closest friends only to have a waitress who doesn't come to the table, won't stay for more than a second, didn't ask how our food was, and what's going on with every person who works here not knowing anything about the menu? I gave this place a second chance and clearly there is a lack of direction, training, passion or even an ounce of consideration for the customer. You're in Summerlin which is probably on par with the strip on what you expect when you drop $200-$400 on a meal. There shouldn't be any issues when you're paying  $16 for an omelette that comes out bland and boring. I'm embarrassed that we brought them here to this. We won't be coming back off of shear principle. Things need to be fixed or this will be the next restaurant to turnover quickly.

"I wouldn't come here to satisfy your Taiwanese cravings. When you first enter, it is as if you entered into a sauna. You sit yourself down and find yourself taking off your layers as you look at the menu. My friend and I ordered the Pork Bone hot pot and the beef noodle soup. The pork bone hot pot was meh. The soup was not as rich as I had anticipated. The contents within (potato, tomato, pork, napa cabbage, crab chunks, and mushrooms) were soft and unflavorful. It seemed as if it was a jumble of left over\/ frozen meat and veggies. The beef noodle soup, on the other hand, was delicious. The noodles were thick and al dente. It seemed home made because the strands were not uniform. The beef was tender. The soup was on point. This place offers a ""sauce bar"" consisting of sesame sauce, taiwanese sauce, chili oil, cilantro, and garlic. It was very limited and the ingredients did not appear to be fresh.

Hmmm.....only about 4 tables had customers. Last night, 9\/15, we went for an anniversary dinner. My meal, hangar steak, was ordered medium and it came out very rare and cold in the middle. It got sent back, and it came out about 8 minutes later the same, only slightly more done. By this time my husband and child were almost done eating. I sent it back again, and it came out cooked properly but the garnishes were dry and basically substandard. We got the same answer from our waiter...""we are short handed in the kitchen"".  The manager came out and apologized profusely but my evening  was ruined by this point. They tried appeasing me with a half pour more of the wine I ordered.  They removed the entree off our bill and gave me a coupon for money off our next meal there. Won't be a next time.

"Very expensive for what you get. I work in the mall, so it's very convenient to eat here, and pretty quick too. The staff are very competent and polite. However,  it's about 10 dollars for a regular sized bowl of noodles with no additions. If you do decide to add chicken, it is very very obviously frozen and tasteless. The texture is plasticy. I ususally get the steak stroganoff, which is hit or miss. I really love it about half the time, and the other half it tastes bland. They do have Sriracha sauce out and available, which is nice.

When we asked the concierge,  he said that he had no information and we needed to get in line of the guest services. I'm sure he could have pulled up the account to see what we had with our room. The couch in the room had burn stains and noticed something on the bathroom walls...something hard and white. Not sure what it was, but imagination can run wild. The only good thing about the hotel is the cleaning woman. She made sure everything was cleaned and we had clean towels. She could have told us that clean towels are somewhere and to get it ourselves, but she did her job not like anyone else I did mention before. If you don't mind a 2 star hotel and  clean towels everyday this would be perfect. But just down the strip not even a block away, there are other hotels.......WAY BETTER.",0.0

We left a call back number, etc. We got there at noon and the employee taking out order was clearly new and had no idea what was going on, ""I didn't even know we were having a challenge till like yesterday"". The manager was very rude and said ""you wee supposed to call"". We told him we did, and I saw our name, number in our party, and 12pm written on their paper. He told us it would take 40 minutes to cook, which is understandable, but defeated the purpose of calling the day before to tell them how many were coming and what time we'd be there.

"What a scam.  Never order the 89 install.  Better yet don't buy here go to Home Depot.

"I understand purchasing a car is never a great process and can be very frustrating.  This is the 6th car I have purchased and I have never had such a terrible experience.  The purchasing of the car was not too bad but it was the aftermath that earned them a 1 star rating.

A few days after purchasing my car my tire started losing a little tire pressure.  I filled it up and then a few days later it went completely flat as I was driving. I go to change the tire to put the spare on but find out the the jack that was provided with the car was completely bent and unusable.  I had to get a ride to a store to get a fix a flat that lasted until I got home.  After putting the fix a flat in, I notice that the hole in the tire was over what looked like a patch or a defect.  I called and made an appointment to have them take a look.

At the appointment, the sales person initially told me there was nothing they could do about the tire, but they could replace the jack.  I said ""Are you kidding me???"" I have had this car for less than 15 days and it is obvious that you sold me a bad tire, but still she would not do anything.  I cannot believe that the tires and jack passed their used car inspection.  I have 2 young kids and they sold me a dangerous car to drive and then said they could do nothing about it.

We then proceeded to speak to a manger.  His name was Mike Conway and he is amazing.  He helped in every way that he could and made us feel better about the situation.  As we were talking to Mike, the sales person ran up and told him to not worry about it and that she is taking care of it.  All of the sudden, now that she saw us talking to a manager, she wanted to help again.  She ended up replacing the tire and quickly rushing the car back to us.  We explained that we didnt want a quick job done and that we want the car fully inspected before we will drive it again.  We got a rental car and left.

The car was finished 2 days later with a new tire and the car was detialed thanks to Mike.  Mike explained that they did sell us a defective tire.  I still cant believe this was not caught during the inspection.  We inspected the car ourselves and find that the jack they gave us, does not fit the car and now its just rolling around in the back seat.  The other 3 tires have very little tread and the new one has full tread.  The car now pulls and does not drive as nice. We are goin to have to purchase 3 new tires less than a month after buying the car.  To top it off, when we picked up our car there was a giant 10 inch tear on the back seat where the seat is sewed together that was not there when we dropped it off.  My wife and I were so furious when we picked up the car, but decided instead of dealing with anyone else at this place again, we would rather pay for the seat repair ourselves and just be done with Courtesy Chevrolet.

I would advise anyone with kids to never purchase a used car at Courtesy Chevrolet because they obvioulsy do not do very good on their inspections to make sure the vehicle is safe.  I felt that every person we talked to was either trying to blame us for the tire or just simply rush us out of there.  They already made their money off of me and they wanted me gone.  That is how I felt.  The sales person told me that the reaon the jack was bent was because of the way I jacked up the car.  I told her in the nicest way possible that I never used the jack and that it was too bent to even attempt to lift a car.  I was sold a car with a defective tire and a useless jack and the only person to aknowledge that was Mike Conway.  I hope he can one day find a job somewhere else where he is not surrounded by rude and incompetent people because he was the only good experience we had their.

The souvlaki (I ordered pork) was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of char, but could have been more seasoned (more lemon, more herbs). The Greek salad was decent, with a good amount of feta. However, the feta was quite mild and the salad could have used a touch more salt or briny-ness from the feta. Also, the cucumber and tomatoes were cut on the larger side and, as a result, a bit unwieldy. The star of the dish was definitely the tzatziki, which was perfectly balanced in its creaminess, yogurty tang, lemony acidity, garlic, and herbaceous-ness.

With respect to the service, we were promptly greeted at the door and seated (we arrived towards the end of the lunch rush).

Who the heck serves crab on a particular weekday? Weird. Also we had to pay 2 bucks per person for tax. Again, huh? I have used a Groupon voucher before at other restaurants and don't remember ever having to pay sales tax because it is usually already included in the voucher price.

As usual, any time we do up a buffet, we grab a plate and do a little scoping around. Some things looked ok. I came back with a couple slices of ummm well done rare prime rib? Let me explain. The outer part of the meat was so well done that it was actually crispy. The inner part was blood red. I think what happened was that they cooked it at a really high temperature so it looked like it was done from the outside. I don't think they even bothered to use a meat thermometer. If you refer to my pic, my description is 100 percent accurate. Im a carnivore so what they did to that poor peace of meat was pure travesty. Only bright spot was the outer crispy part was mainly seasoned fat which was surprisingly good because raw meat does not have any flavor. And no, I did not try to eat the super red bloody middle part. Well, maybe a little bit of outer part next to it that was medium rare. Still no flavor. 

Wow. I cant believe I just wasted a whole paragraph on improperly cooked prime rib. In other news, we also tried some of the Chinese items like Kung Pao Chicken and Chinese Spare Ribs. They all tasted the same. Dry and rubbery. There were pork spare ribs which looked like it gave me hope but it turned out like the rest only this time they tried to smother it in barbeque sauce. imagine barbeque flavored chewing gum. They had some bacon mac n cheese in a separate little bowl which I thought was kind of cute. Only problem was that the so called bacon part of it was just a couple sprinkles of imitation bacon bits. The cheese sauce itself was watery when you dipped your spoon towards the bottom. The elbow macaroni was surprisingly cooked all the way through.

For those that aren't familiar with the Mongolian style of cooking you basically get vegetables and seasoning together in a bowl. Then you give it to the cook and tell them what type of meat you want cooked with it on a round table type of grill. I put garlic and some chili seasoning on there but still could not get any flavor out of it after the first bite.

Dessert? Maybe it should be called deserted because it looks like the employees just threw some cream and sugar together and put it on display. To play it safe, we got the crème brulee. Its basically flan that has the top glazed with a torch. Unfortunately the top part of it was the only part that was cooked. As soon as we stuck our spoons into it, it was very watery and didn't have any kind of consistency all through out.

The one bright spot from our experience was that our server Rosa was excellent. She consistently filled our sodas and took our plates of mostly uneaten food away. I was thinking she was going to say something about our wasted food but I think by now she is used to seeing people not even try to finish their plates. We gave her a 10 dollar tip because not only did she give us good service, we felt bad for her for having to deal with cleaning up all this bad food on a nightly basis.

In the end, the only things worth mentioning that didn't disappoint were the crispy seasoned fat renderings from the prime rib and our diet cokes which I was surprised was not flat at all the way things were going. The only thing that I can think of that would be worth the price we paid would be that if you were an alcoholic then the all you can drink wine and beer would be right down your alley. I don't drink so im not really sure if getting wasted at a buffet is something special. Bottom line is I DONT RECOMMEND EATING HERE EVEN IF IT WAS FREE! Shame on the Palms for letting a piece of dump like this exist in such a nice casino hotel. Memo to whoever from the Palms that might respond to this. Go ahead. I would like to know your explanation as to why the food here is so horrible. Oh, and don't bother offering me a comped meal. I don't think I can eat there any more because me and the misses are now traumatized and might need therapy. If we do, maybe you guys can foot the bill. That's the least you can do.

Yelp 2015 Review #31
529 overall",0.0
"Not wanting to drive an hour back home after going out I searched for a hotel in downtown or southside. Noting the positive reviews I selected the Hyatt House. Also, the price seemed pretty good relative to other higher end hotels in the area. Since I read about the $14 parking ahead of time on other reviews I just opted to park on the street. The hotel itself is pretty nice and my room was very large, modern and snazzy looking. Upon showering, I did notice some marks on the glass shower door as well as a piece of hair. I should have brought this up to management, but I was more concerned with getting ready to go out for a night on the town. My sleep was very good as my bed was comfy and the AC worked great. The next morning I went to the continental breakfast which I found to be decent and admittedly a fair step up from lower end hotels where I've stayed before. Linda, one of the staff working in the breakfast area was fabulous. She complimented me on my shirt showing her Steelers knowledge and pride and also went out of her way to get me cereal after they removed it due to closing time. If I could write a separate review about her I would. Digressing, my breakfast was between decent and okay. Since I was paying almost twice as much as I'd normally pay for a hotel I wanted to use the pool as I would then feel I truly got my money's worth. As I was walking towards the pool barefoot I noticed the floor was pretty dirty especially around the breakfast area. This may not have been unreasonable since there were a lot of people there, but still it made me wish I hadn't left my slippers in the car that was parked several blocks away. Upon arriving at the room where the pool was located I saw a sign that said closed for maintenance. I asked the reception how long they'd be closed and they said he had just started to work on it. So I never got to use the pool.

All in all the hotel isn't bad. The location is great, room is large and comfy, and pricing is relatively good. However, I still think that for over $200 a night I should have access to all the facilities and my room should be spic and span clean, which admittedly I should have brought up to management. In any case, I could see myself staying here again but not without trying out the other hotels in the area first.",0.0
"Awful venue. Their staff were cold from before we entered the door. The place is outdated and your shoes stick to the floor almost no matter where you walk.. 
I waited 5 minutes for this one bartender to serve me, and instead serves the two ladies next to me who were not there as long.. I didn't say anything, but the two women pointed at me, saying I was first. The bartender said ""I'm the bartender, I decide"" and served the two ladies.  When I was served, my change was put in two different spots and I was shorted two dollars. When I protested she contacted security, who told me I had to leave. They started push me towards the exit, and as I tried to explain, they told me I could explain outside..
I went to the lobby where he was joined by a second security guard, who then grabbed my hand and took my drink (I had only had 1, and the 2nd one was full) and told me to keep walking. I asked to speak to someone about what happened but instead was put in a headlock by the first guard, and the second guard grabbed me as well. They forced me out of the building, as I yelled ""stop! I'm not resisting!"" several times, and I wasn't. I never raised a hand to them. As they were doing this, they ripped my shirt. It was humiliating and I couldn't believe what was happening. I will never go back here.",0.0
"We generally try all independent brunch places on weekends to support local chef's. We are sorry to say we will not be supporting them again. Our wait wasn't long and the server was fine. However eggs benedict was TERRIBLE. Absolutely no flavor in the hollandaise  sauce and the meat had less. Come on meat in the south without flavor seriously.  Now this might not be what they are known for and you are thinking why would you go here if that was your order however when you go to a place that specializes in variety plates someone in the party might just want classics. I had the lemon poppy seed French toast. Very over powering and sweet. Even for me who will go out on a limb and try creative plates.
OH coffee was good that is why the second star.",0.0
"This place is quite nice and has a nice modern interior design. Very inviting and the server that we had was helpful in terms of the menu. 

Their bread is awesome. Good for sharing.l and as a starter. 

Prices were affordable, not too bad. Then I got the chef's special. I was really contemplating getting the Mac n cheese and I should have done that because the chef's special was not so special at all. The battered fried fish was smokey and way way too salty!!! It was horrible. Each bite I took, I had to down it with water. I wasn't the only one who found it too spicy. A couple of people on my table who ordered the same thing had the same comments about. Anyway, it wasn't a big deal. I tries my boyfriend' s grilled octopus and it was delicious. Great bold flavours in there and the potatoes were delicious with it. Lastly, we had the poutine pizza to share and it was AHH-MAZING.  That one I was really happy about.

I would definitely come here again to try the mac n cheese now since I didn't get it last time. But for my first experience, it was decent. Just really disappointed  about the chef's special. I'm going to give them another chance to redeem themselves by trying it out again and going for their best dishes. Hopefully my rating will change for next time!",0.0
This place is amazingly consistent and unfriendly service not even one single goodbye as our six party group leaves.,0.0
"Decent ESSO compared to other gas stations in the area.

But there are 3 major drawbacks:

1) They mix water in the windshield cleaning fluid. So when the temperature is around freezing or below, the windshield service is useless!

2) Only pumps 1 through 4 which are right in front of the cashier's station are open to pump first-pay after 24hrs. The rest of the pumps are set to pre-paid between 10pm & 6am!
Either open them all like Petro-Canada or have the cashier take payment through a stupid hole in the wall like at most Shell gas stations.

3) Given its location at a major intersection and with the T&T behind it, it's difficult to get in & out any time of the day or night with the sheer volume of traffic, and be prepared to be cut off by rash & reckless drivers while you line up behind a car to pump.",0.0
"I have been going to Evviva for over 3 years now, 1 to 2 times per month. My last visit left me wondering if I will ever go back again. The servers were abundant and quick; the kitchen was painfully slow. I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich on RYE. My wife ordered side pancakes and side bacon. After about 25 long minutes our simple meal arrived. The pancakes were cold and my Montreal Smoked Meat sandwhich was served on toasted white bread. When we commented on the pancakes being cold they were replaced in a few minutes which was good. When I asked whether the kitchen ran out if rye bread our server apologized and said she would get me a side of rye bread. 10 minutes later, still nothing. Our server was shocked that the rye bread hadn't arrived and checked with the kitchen. After 5 more minutes I received toasted marbled white bread (ribbons of brown colored bread in the white). Ridiculous!! I said nothing, ate the smoked meat, left the bread and concluded a very disappointing breakfast.

The manager was present and never once came by to appolagize or even adjust the bill. The manager looked different from before as did a lot of the serving staff so I can only conclude that the restaurant is under new management.",0.0
I was a huge fan of this location until today. Do not shop here unless you want to be degraded and humiliated. I was escorted by an employee to return a small box (shoe box size) that was was full of the 12 packages of the product I was going to buy (only 15 small packages fit in a box). Watch out for very rude employees and don't try to take any of the boxes!,0.0
"Bar staff is friendly and most the staff I have spoken with are nice enough. HOWEVER for a market already saturated in BBQ spots the food here lackluster at best. Some things are good (ribs, pork rinds, beans) some things are NOT pork is bland, bread pudding is hard & most sides unimaginative. 
    Also the owner doesn't seem very friendly. I heard a bartender told not to give out samples of beer. So they could push flight sales. Well for a place with a large selection to force people to buy a pint or flight, to try a beer they may not even enjoy is not a good business model. 
    Zoe is a great bartender. There is also a SOLID brown liqueur selection and great craft beer menu.

"Horrible horrible customer service.  They missed pieces of my furniture,  informed me quite late about the confusion,  gave the driver my wrong address even though they had the right one on file, gave me a call ten minutes before delivery even though I requested thirty minutes several times, delivered broken lamps, and ultimately customer service was unwilling to even accept the issue and almost had a lady yell at me not to argue and read the terms and conditions. I wanted to go back there for my dining sets but not going back. Very disappointed because the instore people are really good. Customer service needs a make over. Once I get my furniture I am done with Ashley for good unless their furniture breaks ( can't imagine  my night mare if it does to get customer service to fix it ).",0.0
By far some of the worst Nachos I have ever had. I would have had better nachos at a run down tweeker 7\/11. I am pretty sure I just gave myself food poisoning.

None of the cheese was melted and they used can nacho cheese also.. you can totally tell the pulled everything out of a can.,0.0
"This place gets so much hype on Yelp that my friends and I decided to try it. Sam's Cafe is super cute-looking from the outside. But that's where the good stops. Well, the waiter was really nice. But other than those two things, I see no positives about this place. The food was floppy and soggy and the utensils were not washed well... Maybe we ordered all the wrong things, though we did order the vaunted French toast,... Seems like that could be a possibility seeing that this place has 4 stars.",0.0
"I keep trying this place, hoping it could get better but it hasn't yet. I've had so many items and they are all just ok. Two weeks ago I went in for a breakfast sandwich and after a 15 minute wait I finally got my sandwich. When I went to office and unwrapped my breakfast, I saw 1 egg, covered in pepper (so much that it looked like cigarette ash), with LETTUCE AND TOMATO and the smallest little piece of cheese. Now waiting for 16 minutes wasn't great but getting LETTUCE and TOMATO on a breakfast sandwich?? I didn't ask for lettuce and tomato and this isn't listed on the menu. Why would it be? And all the pepper and the tiniest bit of cheese?? I will pay for quality, freshly made food and I'll even tolerate so-so service but I can't deal with really terrible food.

Spent A lot of money on a Penthouse loft and the room was horrible, wall paper were peeling off in the bathroom and the carpet was wet. They say someone overflowed the bathtub and flooded the place. At least fix the problem before the next guess. So the apologized and invited me back this year to make up for the problem, great right that is a good move until they check me into an suite that had dog urine on the carpet, and they moved me to a lower floor but took them over a day to move me and did not tell me how long it would take we will call you when its ready, 5 calls and 3 visits to the front desk the room was ready at 3 pm the next day waisted the whole day for these people.

"We used this space to host our child's dedication party early this year. The guests loved the food. Although some (including my family and I ) thought the jerk chicken was salty. 

The food was generally good. I would rate it about a 3.5 or 4. 

But this rating is based more on the use of the space. We would rate organization a 1. The space was not ready as was promised by start time. In fact it was still in a mess from the party the night before. When we got there, we had to wait for one person to do all the cleaning - that included mopping and reorganizing the furniture. The balloon decoration I was promised was not even kept. 

The worst part of it all was that 90% of our guests arrived while the cleanup and setup was still taking place.

"Had a Living Social voucher with Megan. It was a great deal - $65 for haircut and partial highlight. First issue - she asked if she could cut, color and then send my daughter home wet. While I thought it detracted from the whole salon experience of leaving looking like a million bucks, my daughter (14) didn't mind. She wanted a shoulder length haircut with ombré. Megan agreed. Fast forward 2 hours - hair wet as a mop, my daughter is done. The length looked cute but the hair appeared pretty dark for an ombré. My daughter said Megan was super nice so I generously tipped her on what would have been the full price. As her hair dried, as I suspected, it was not  ombré. It was subtly highlighted. It looks nice IF that had been what she wanted. It just wasn't. It's so subtle. If the voucher didn't cover an ombré, I wish she would have just told me. But since we had an expectations, unfortunately the experience fell way short.",0.0
"Sip was like a first date... I had high expectations and when I got to the spot, I thought the concept and ambiance was cool! I could totally hang out here! We ordered our food: two vanilla lattes (one with almond milk), double stacked pancakes and the chorizo burrito. The employees were friendly and they tell us they've been open for two weeks. We sit down and I started looking out the window, picturing myself sitting at the patio (on a nice day) with my vanilla latte and chorizo burrito loving the idea (at this point, I did not receive our coffee or food yet). 

So after ten minutes or so, we get our coffee and food. The vanilla latte seemed a little bland so we asked for a little more vanilla. The chorizo burrito was good, but it was the spiciest burrito I've ever eaten and trust me, I like spicy food. Even the hubs said it was really spicy and he loves spicier food than me. It was so hot, that I could only take two bites. My mouth was on fire and I was moving on to the pancakes. The problem was that my mouth was numb from the spice, that I couldn't even taste the pancakes or the syrup so I can't even tell you if I liked it. We leave...and I was at a lost for words because I have no idea if I like Sip or not. 

Should I give Sip a second date? I noticed they have happy hour and live music on certain days so I'm keeping an open mind to come back to see if there could be something more than a cool concept and ambiance for me.

My final straw was how they handled her final days.  She became suck again from her renal issues, this time quite suddenly and more intense.  It was bad.  I knew she was dying, so when I called for an appointment I was crying and I guess this freaked them out.  When I arrived I saw a make vet (PS I never saw the same vet twice here.). The guy hydrated her and said she's be fine in a day.  Since she was SO sick, and it was a Friday, I questioned this because she was suffering a great deal.  I was told she'd be fine and to take her home and let her sleep.

By later than night she was shivering and wetting herself, something she had NEVER done.  When I called for help Saturday, they had no vet on duty and told me I'd have to wait until Monday to see one.  I took her to the Champaign Emergency Vet who did a blood text (The douche at Caring Hands never bothered!!!!), and confirmed my suspicions that she was indeed slowly dying.  We elected to euthanize her and end her suffering.

My theory with The Caring Hands treatment?  They didn't want to deal with a crying male owner on a Friday when they told him they had to put his cat to sleep and decided to let me go, KNOWING it would be someone else's problem over the weekend or my cat would suffer more, but eventually die.  This is regrettably the only explanation of their behavior and it sickens me that I trusted them for a minute.

The one and only gal working the register was making the shakes - so that was a real problem.  Meanwhile, the person running food was just standing there - she couldn't have run over and helped? One employee was walking around - not sure what he was even doing because the tables were all dirty.  I got a napkin and cleaned off a table for myself.  Seems like they could have used their people better.  And the guy in the kitchen yelled something - not sure what it was, but sounded angry.  All the employees were not very friendly - until we were leaving.

^that was my initial feeling prior to dining at the highly anticipated Zin burger. I dined here opening week, and again three days ago as a second chance in hopes the kinks would be worked out. Not so much. 

The servers on both occasions seemed unfamiliar with the menu specifics and lacked the confidence and personality I am used to from the other Fox Concepts. 

Both visits I ordered the same thing....sweet potato fries and the garden vegetable salad. The fries keep this review afloat. They are perfectly crisp, and the dipping sauce is nothing you would expect but everything you would want. Yum. Order two servings. 

The garden vegetable salad has all the makings of a vegetarians dream, with the added bonus of the almighty quinoa to boost the protein. Too bad they DRENCH it in salad dressing. I had to actually spit it out because the dressing was so potent. Pools of it in the bowl and the spinach looked like seaweed from being so wet. I asked to have another one with out the dressing and it took them 25 minutes to bring the new one. The manager didn't verbally address me, or the soup....I mean, salad. She did comp the salad, but I have no incentive to go back for another round of this. My husband is probably accurate when he said ""you can't order a salad when you go to a burger place"".",0.0

The waitress came by several minutes later and took our drink order.

We arrived early but at the time of our reservation we were told, outer table would be ready in 15 minutes. Instead of apologizing she intimated it was our problem! When we were finally seated, the hostess had us hold our drinks, at which our guest spilled most of her drink by the time we arrived at our table! 5 star- no one has a tray to carry the drinks on?

"Rude. Wow. Pizza was a disaster. Sauce guy was rude, slopped sauce in the middle and over one edge with 1\/3 of the pizza... No sauce. Very skimpy when asking for ricotta, even with it being the only cheese requested. I asked for more and got no response, just a pile of ricotta smacked onto the pizza and it was then passed down the line. Well, thank you, sir. The next girl asked what I wanted. I said basil. She then asked if that was all before I even had a chance to ask for anything else. I said no and asked for garlic. She grabbed a handful and it ended up in three piles (big piles) on the pizza. I kind of chuckled and asked if she could spread it out a bit. Again, no response, she didn't want to spread it out so I got just another pile of garlic and an evil look. Two incredibly rude employees and a crappy looking pizza. I should've taken a picture, but instead I stood there for at least 2 minutes before another guy asked me if I would like anything else. I politely explained that it was a disaster and when I asked the girl to change the garlic it did not work out for me, among other things. At this point I didn't even know what to do, this was a first for me. Obviously these ppl could not have cared less. I told the man that I did not want it and was going to leave. He asked to remake it and the girl that messed part of it up gave me a very evil look and made some comment as well. This place is similar to Blaze Pizza. The idea is the only thing similar though!

When questioned the cost, he described the work as, ""a full rebuild"".  I also asked him to quote me a price for replacing the entire toilet.  He quoted $318 labor only to remove and install a new toilet.  I ultimately decided to replace the toilet since we have had ongoing issues with leaking.

"My wife and I stayed at the Mirage from 11\/25 - 11\/27. I've been going to Las Vegas since 1971, and my wife and I actually lived in Henderson (next door to Vegas), but it was our first stay at the Mirage, even though we've eaten there many times in he past.

The room was nice and overall, very comfortable. The bed was comfortable as well, which is important to us.  That's the PRO!

The CONS were the buffet and the casino areas.

The Mirage, once upon a time, had a really fantastic buffet, and I would have rated it 4 - 5 stars at one time, but not anymore! The buffet this time around actually SUCKED! No longer any pride in food preparation.  Even their prime rib was horrible and without any flavor at all.  The ONLY redeeming items were their desserts! VERY SAD!! I had heard this from a close friend of mine who was there this past August, but I just assumed that maybe they had just had an off-night. She was 100% correct though!

What REALLY upset me the most however, was that they weren't serving Alaskan king crab legs.  When I had checked the reviews on the Mirage a couple of weeks before we went, there were many places that weren't serving the King crab legs, but it stated that the MIRAGE WOULD BE SERVING THEM. So just to be on the safe side, I called the Mirage about them and they connected me with someone at the buffet. The person I spoke with GUARANTEED me that they would be serving them. GREAT!

When we arrived on 11\/25, there were NO Alaskan king crab legs to be found.  I asked our server if they had run out of them, and she said that they weren't serving them at all.

One of my co workers was sick and to clear congestion i typically go straight to a spicy Korean soup of sorts to get me breathing normal again.

"Chef Zenbayashi from the original Curry Zen decided to take on a difference concept of restaurant service, self-service curry. Instead of being seated and having a server serve you like at the original Curry Zen, Curry Zen Express wants you to order at the cashier and seat yourself.

When I received my order, I got the right portion of rice, curry, and chicken katsu. However, my friend got approximately half the portion that I had. They should be more consistent in their portion sizes. The curry wasn't as flavorful as the original Curry Zen, but it was okay.

"Their pizzas are generally pretty great, but with recent shake-ups, they're driving their vegetarian customers away as well as cutting corners in general.

I've been slightly obsessed with La Fav since I discovered them a year and a half ago. Their pizzas have been beautiful and delicious, and their delivery service prompt. I did develop a habit of heating them in my oven before eating, as they stay very true to their Italian style and so lose their heat quickly. A quick ten minutes in a hot oven is enough to reinvigorate the pizza without overcooking it. Careful, though, they sometimes stretch the base so thin that even moving it to an oven grill leads to gaping, soggy holes.

There was a Portobello branch up until recently, but that seems to have gone now. There are also several Vittoria (the parent company of La Fav) restaurants in Edinburgh I didn't know existed. I have a feeling they've been expanding really, really quickly over the past few years and that the expansion didn't go so well. Portobello branch is gone, and their sauces on the side have taken a turn for the cheap and nasty. I'm talking about their garlic mayo dip (MAYO? Ew. Sour cream, please) as well as the spicy sauce that comes with their sweet potato fries.

Generally speaking, they've always had a tendency to undercook their calzone. I can forgive that, because when they're cooked enough, they're delicious. Way too often, they come to us with almost room-temperature centres. Not that it matters to me anyway, since they've removed their vegetarian calzone and don't allow you to REMOVE toppings when you customise your pizzas in the order menu. A friend of mine loved their veggie lasagna, but that's gone as well. What's happening?

I can understand the lasagna. I can't imagine they make each lasagna from scratch for every order. However, the pizza? Is it really THAT much to ask to replace the meat with some other topping and keep it on the menu? I guess so.

Last time I ordered, the order took 1 hour 20 minutes to arrive (took 1hr 40 the time before) and when I called them after waiting for an hour, they said it was in the car and would be another five minutes. That's five. Not twenty. When it arrived, at least the pizzas were good. The Fire and Smoke is a new addition to their veggie range, and it's a welcome change from the New Vegetariana, which is the only other one that appeals to me and even that's quite a boring one.

Oh, and last time I tried their sweet potato fries, which have previously been delicious, not only was the sauce dreadful, but the fries themselves were soggier than a sock left out in the rain.

So years ago my then wife and I travelled to North Africa on an impromptu vacation to go and get some sun and discover some exotic culture. Tunisia to be exact. Only days into things, she wakes up shivering at 5am in tremendous tremors and cold sweats.

The resort doctor calls it a ""flu"". No one has a flu like that. I don't trust him and get us on the first plane out. We stop in Europe and the city hotel's doctor (who it turns out is also originally from Tunisia) also says it's ""some type of flu"". I decide to pack our stuff to the US ""where they have real doctors"".

We land in Phoenix and head to ""world famous"" Mayo clinic. At the time we were barely 30 years old, so Mayo had quite a hard time even allowing us to book an appointment. Never mind that at the time I was lucky enough to have one of the world's best full coverage insurance plans available on the entire planet. The card from the plans gave them phone numbers to call to have, get this, a full bank guarantee on any procedure they deemed necessary. Any. So what do the Mayo people say? We cannot accept you.

My wife is in tremendous pain and these people will not see her. It didn't matter if we had money or not. Back then I could pay any amount they wanted. But this so called first world facility will not see us. I even offer to prepay anything they want. No can do.

After being physically turned away, I call them on the phone and somehow speak with someone who thinks we are worthy of their consideration. Amazing. We get an appointment.

I drive my wife to the appointment on the day. We are subjected to more humiliations. Can you even pay? What can you pay? Etc etc.

The appointment takes place. We see one doctor. Then another who it turns out is the head of the department. A grey haired, older fellow clad in a white medical outfit. From behind his large luxurious desk, he starts to pontificate. Speaking to my wife he says: """"Ma'am, I don't find anything wrong with you. Therefore, I don't think anything IS wrong with you"". We can't believe his statements. That very morning I had had to bathe her and carry her so she could make it to the car and the appointment.

I ask to have another doctor. We get a young gal. Her first comment is ""I don't know what is wrong with you, but I'm going to try my very best to find out"". Multiple batteries of tests later and many weeks of tremendous suffering later, the answer comes back. She calls us to say this:

""The results came back. You have a rare form of typhoid"".

Typhoid.

The head of the department just days earlier had said he didn't think anything was wrong with her. Nothing was wrong with her according to that 'great professor'. Yeah.

The admissions office had refused to let her be seen when we first contacted them. They had refused to see her. She had typhoid and could not be seen.""0

These people believe we are there to serve their needs. It is not so. It's the other way around. Time to put in place modern programs turning medical bank account emptying from a wild west zoo where the little person is milked with no limits and mistreated to a modern system where *they* help people and have to publicly post all their rates. Not the other way around.

"I just called and a sweet lady answered and was saying they don't charge for an estimate for recliner repairs, abruptly someone else gets on the line and interrupts our conversation. He then says look at our website for an estimate for fabric. I kindly informed him I'm calling for recliner repairs. He then says, take pictures of it so they can see the problem. However, I kindly again said I don't believe pictures will help, when I look at the recliner, it looks as if there isn't anything wrong with it. He immediately tells me I'm going to take over 3 hours in repairs for labor to fix it and it will cost me over $350. My thoughts....how do you know what the problem is and the length if tone to fix it, when you haven't assessed the problem in person and I offered to bring it in. He says, yep, that will be at least $350 to fix. I said thank you and have a good day.  Honestly, this wasn't at all what I was expecting.

"My husband and I stopped here after coming home from vacation. After a long flight, we were starving and this was one of the closest places to where we parked our car. From the outside, it doesn't look like much. And it isn't much on the inside either.  However, I don't care about appearance as long as the food is good. I ordered hot bbq wings with fries, he ordered a chicken parm sandwich. It just so happened that the kitchen made too many deep fried pickles for someone else's order and so we got a complimentary order of those too. I thought the food portions were large, especially the fries. The wings were ok, not my favorite. The chicken parm sandwich left a lot to be desired. Although, a place called ""Wings, Suds and Spuds,"" you probably shouldn't order a chicken parm sandwich. As for the deep fried pickles, they were pretty ordinary.

When planning my 5 year old daughters birthday I thought Pump It up would be the perfect venue. WOW. I have never felt like I have wasted my time, or my money, more. 

i had ordered 6 pizzas through PIU to be ready when all of the kids got there. The party started at 7, I waited until about 7:30 until I said anything... 
First of all, the staff was so rude. You would think that people who are in the business of hosting parties would be hospitable. WRONG.  I had the ""pleasure"" of meeting the manager. When I asked her what the status on our food was it was almost as if she rolled her eyes at me. Our food didn't get there until almost 8:00! An entire hour sitting in a room with 15 hungry kids waiting... and not even an apology. 
It doesn't stop there. 
Once the kids went into the jumping room, I was nervous for their safety the entire time. Their employees were standing off in the corners having their own conversations... Not interacting with the kids, or making sure that they're safe. I would understand if these were older children, but 5 and 6 year olds?! REALLY?! I even saw 1 young girl on her cellphone!! I said something to the manager who was there and she said she would correct the problem... Which never happened.

Came here for summerlicious for lunch with a group. Server was very friendly and attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. And I love the vibe of the restaurant - spacious and rustic feeling and clean. However, the food itself is a bit mediocore. The waitress said the meatballs were home-made so I ordered that (outside of the summerlicious menu). I was expected a bunch of meatballs but instead it was just one large one. Looked more like an appetizer and not a main. It tasted okay but definitely overly garlicky. The mains for the summerlicious menu were okay - no one at my table was too overly impressed with them. I did enjoy the desserts however (tiramisu and chocolate jar cake).

My friend bought me a Groupon for a ""classic blowout, hair therapy treatment, and a five-minute scalp massage"".

When I arrived, I asked for my hair to be styled with big waves which the stylist said would take too long since she would need to blowdry it and then style it. So, I was given the option to have my hair either dry styled or shampooed and blowdryed but not styled. Well, since I wanted the hair therapy and scalp massage, I opted for the blowdry.

What a waste of time. There was no massage, it was the fastest, most rushed shampoo I have ever had, and I didn't get my hair treatment. Then, she blowdryed my hair as promised, but that was literally it. Normally this would include a round brush or paddle brush to at least make it straight and styled. Nope, it wasn't even dry. She kept asking me to run my hands through my hair to make sure it was dry - I guess she couldn't tell on her own. And she declared me finished with still damp, still wavy, and unstyled hair.

Then came the kicker. I hand my card over to pay and the receptionist (a man but I forget his name) informed me that they would be adding gratuity and told me how much I was to pay!

"Sometime before June 5th, 2014 ( I paid for services on June 5th per my receipt) I brought my Springfield 1911 GI to Wild West Guns for some gunsmithing. I had t hem install the following: Slide stop, barrel bushing, firing pin stop, thumb safety, disconnector, sear spring, hammer strut, refit the barrel and perform a trigger job. I supplied all of the parts myself, I only paid for the services. . I had already had a new sear, hammer and beavertail grip safety installed, however the nothing had been tuned. 

All of the parts I bought were the hammer forged \/ bar stock type (parts from EGW, Cylinder & Slide, Harrison Design...) that needed to be hand fitted by a gunsmith. When I got my pistol back the first time I complained that the trigger did not feel very good (it had some creep). The gunsmith said that I just needed to shoot it and it would get better. During my first range trip with the gun I discovered that the hammer would fall forward by itself and fire the weapon when I moved the safety from ""safe"" to ""fire"" position. I brought it back to Wild West Guns who verified the issue. The gunsmith took it in the back for about an hour and fixed the problem. I am not sure if a trigger job was ever done to the pistol in the first place. Regardless, I was given an unsafe pistol and that is unacceptable. I was given the pistol back and it no longer had the problem, however I still did not like the trigger, it was better than before but still had some creep. I told the gunsmith that I wasn't satisfied and I was told again that I just had to shoot it and it would improve. I was kind of annoyed because I paid a lot of money for the new parts to the pistol and I expected it to have a very clean break. 

Its been about a year and a half, and I have fired about 3000 - 4000 rounds through my 1911 since it was worked on by Wild West Guns. The trigger still feels the same as it did when I got it back after the safety issue was fixed. Also, since ever since I got my pistol back from Wild West Guns I have been experiencing failures for my slide to go into battery. I'm not sure what the cause of this is but I did not have this issue before I took my 1911 to Wild West Guns. There is also a small scratch on the frame near the slide stop that I noticed after I got my gun back. Its not an ""idiot scratch"", its in a slightly different area. I detail stripped my 1911 and I also noticed that the hammer strut has carved out a divot on the inner portion of he beavertail grip safety and I am not sure if this is normal.

"This is in a good location because there's no bubbletea place close to it - you'd have to go to Markville Mall for their Ten Ren's or to Pacific Mall otherwise.

The place itself isn't particularly large but it's never full so I guess there's that.  It's very clean, for the most part and somewhat loud, obviously depending how many people there are.  I wouldn't go there with a group larger than five, just because of how limited seating is.  I'd appreciate if their staff members checked up on you to make sure everything's okay (when you dine in).

There is also take out if you don't feel like sticking around - for food and drinks.  I believe they do give you a 10% discount for bubbletea take out too, which is nice.

The menu is pretty large.  Lots to choose from for a meal or just for dessert.  I'd recommend going elsewhere for a meal but you should be fine if you're there for bubbletea or to hang out with friends.  I've had a few different meals there for dinner and I can't say that I was a fan of any of them. Their desserts are alright but you could find better quality desserts elsewhere.  Their food in general's not that great and too expensive for what it is.  I'm not a huge bubbletea fan so I'm not really in a position to judge how it tastes.

Once I went there at midnight for grab a drink (when their closing hours were 1:00) and they said they were closing early since they only had one customer.  Really weird reason to close early.  That annoyed me a little.  Another time my girlfriend paid $21 for a $6 order and the guy working there only gave her back $5.  Took him a while to figure out how much he was 'suppose' to give back in change - isn't that what the cash register's for?

I went there last month with my girlfriend and she made her order and the person at the cashier walked away without taking my order.  This was followed up with no one else in the entire store taking my order, even though I was clearly waiting for such at the cashier.  About ten minutes later, after my girlfriend got her order, they finally took my order.  That's almost as bad as taking someone's order during dine-in and not taking the order for the person they're sitting with.  This has happened three times now, which is unacceptable.

Parking's usually pretty easy to get to.  If there's no spots in front, you can easily get a spot across the parking lot - a little walking won't kill you.  I do like that the parking lot's road is really wide - which makes it easy to get around people who are dropping people off on the side there.

We were there for dinner, so maybe it had been smoked quite a bit earlier in the day.  Regardless, it was not great.  The Texas toast was really just thick sliced bread.  But the plus side of dry, cold pork was that the bread didn't get soggy in the box.  I had beans which were still a hair underdone.  I also tried the slaw which I  didn't like at all.  I expected mayo based or at least vinegar based, but it tasted like it was dressed with nothing but oil.  Why my husband opted for the Kraft mac 'n cheese rather than trying their baked version, I'll never know.  But even that is much better when you make it at home. 

On the plus side...excellent potato salad.  Mayo dressing with just a hint of mustard, not like the overly sweet crap you get at the deli.  Smore dessert was yummy.  Staff was awesome.  All very polite, and they pack to go orders in front of you, so no surprises when you get home.

Based on all the other positive reviews, I would like to try going again sometime. Maybe lunch would be better.  And maybe I can get my car washed, too.  God knows it needs it.",0.0

Went for a regular manicure, as I have an event after work and felt my nails could use some colour.  

Didn't realize that Polish'd only does ""dry"" manicures.  So no soaking, no warm cloths, etc.  You're given the choice of lotion OR a scrub.  I chose the scrub mostly because after being filed and buffed, I really thought my hands could use a wash!  So they lead you over to a sink, and you wash your hands there at the sink with the sugar scrub, and then back to the chair for the polish.

The chairs are uncomfortable... you want to sit high up at the counter, but you can't without jamming your knees... so you have to sit much lower than feels right.   (I should note that before they started, they were one chair short, and despite having an appointment, they asked if they could start me on the bench under the polish selections....  being pregnant and uncomfortable, and having an appt, I hesitated until they noticed a proper chair was coming right up, so I luckily got that....).

The 30-minute manicure was rushed and over in 20 minutes, and I was then ushered back to the bench while they powered through others.

I appreciate a place that is efficient and quick for a lunch-hour place... but I've definitely had better $25-manicures.

Oh - and I used a $30 gift card, and was left with $4 or $5.   I asked them to use that to tip the girl, and was told they can't tip off gift cards.  Hmm... so I had to pull that money out of my purse, and now I'm left with $4 or $5 that I might never use... Didn't seem fair.

Stood there for 5 mins with 2 customers behind me then was told there is only one line! Stood there in the only line for another 25 mins to pick up a package that wasn't delivered during the hold and was asked the most STUPID question of ""did you check your mail today""?!!!! So she checked the back for a second time and even after giving her the tracking #, she said the post man delivered all mail and packages already? She even asked if I wanted to speak to a ""supervisor"" and I said yes, and after being gone another couple of minutes comes back and says there is no supervisor and took my name and said someone would call me back! Like all negative comments previously written, this is by a MILE, the WORST post office I've ever been into! And to no surprise no one has called me back and I don't know what's going on with my package that has no ""updated status"" because I'm sure this post office doesn't have a clue!

I got the beef brisket and flank soup, and the meat was nowhere near as tender as it should have been, and definitely had a weird color. Hubby got the beef combination and in his words ""WTPho is WTSuck."" The broth was very plain.. Had to add tons of sauce and sriracha to give it any flavor. Needless to say, next time we're craving pho it won't be satisfied here.

Maybe I just got the wrong menu item, I will definitely be back and willing to give the place another chance but I am not a fan of their flatbread. I got the Margherita as a takeout order and it was just full of grease. Maybe I'm just a red sauce lover but it was pure olive oil and garlic. Not my preference by any means. The place itself is much bigger and open than I was expecting. As with a lot of downtown chagrin restaurants, parking wasn't the easiest but they do have a separate lot in the back. Not enough for the number of patrons by any means though they do offer complimentary valet. There's a glass blowing shop right next door which I think is awesome! You can watch the blow glass through huge windows as you wait to be seated. I personally don't like the look of the weird fence at this place but hey, to each their own.

"We have been looking to get a new roof for about a year now, we had several quotes.  Local contractors and a couple of bigger businesses like Weather Seal.  The quotes varied like crazy!  Weather Seal came right in the middle and had a much better guarantee than the others, as well as offering financing. 

Our sales rep was nice, spent a lot of time with us and answered all of our questions without making us feel rushed or pressured.  After signing, we were informed someone would call us to get it scheduled and the work would be done within 4-8 weeks.

A month went by and we didn't hear anything, which worked out well for us because we wanted to pay a few things off before having to start paying on this.  Another week or two went by and I realized they had never called to schedule.  I was only worried about this because we had a vacation planned and wanted to be home for the install.  When they did call, it was to let us know that they would begin work in 3 days and that the dumpster would be dropped off the day prior.  

The dumpster did deliver, however they dropped it at the back of our house outside of our fence and probably the farthest possible distance from the house that it could be.  Granted, we don't have a drive in the front and it didn't personally affect us... I felt bad for the guys working.  They had to haul all the old shingles back there through our yard by hand.  We ended up borrowing a wheel barrow from friends to help them out.  In addition, they didn't even know it was there since it was out of their sight - they wasted a lot of time ""waiting"" when they could have been cleaning up.  

Weather Seal had also told us that the shingles would be dropped off the day prior which didn't happen - the truck ended up dropping off around 1pm.  Again, more wasted time for the poor roof crew.  They did the best they could but still didn't finish in one day due to it getting dark... they had to drive all the way back (I think they said 3 hours) to spend an our or two finishing up the next day.  If they would have known where the dumpster was and the shingles been delivered on time, it would have been an easy 1 day job. No personal problem for me, just felt bad for the guys because they were really great!

I couldn't believe how great of a job they did cleaning up when they were done.  We didn't find any nails or anything.  The roof looked great.  Now onto the gutters.  These were different subcontractors that came out, I believe two days after the roof was installed.  We didn't know when they were coming, they just showed up and luckily we were on our lunch break and were home.  They needed power to run their equipment which they would have no access to if we weren't there.  

The gutters look good however, the did a HORRIBLE job cleaning or maybe I should say they did an AWESOME job NOT cleaning.  Our dog came in with a nail in his fur and we found 7 nails on the ground where they removed the old gutters.  Our air conditioner, grill and window sills were covered in all the grime and debris from the old gutters.  They didn't even make an effort to make it look presentable like the roofers did. 

A day or two later, they called to schedule someone to come out so we could sign the final paperwork.  We couldn't get a time figured out on the phone as my husband and I both had to be there so she said she'd call back.  Less than 48 hours later, she called to let me know that the guy would be over in about 2 hours to get all the paperwork signed.  What?!  We had to leave work to go home and meet this guy on short notice.  He did show up on time though.  When we expressed our concerns about the wasted time, bad communication and showed him pictures of the mess left behind he was very nonchalant about it.  Basically that it happens.  I get that, but clean it up.  He said he would go out there and clean it up himself IF we wanted him to, not really offering it up you know.  It's not a cheap thing that we had done, that's why it matters that we aren't out there cleaning up afterward.  We're going to be making payments on this for years to come. 

The way the company was portrayed to me, at least the impression I got when we met with our salesman, was that everyone that came out to work on the project was their direct employee.  Turns out that a lot of subcontractors were used and perhaps that's why the communcation was so bad between Weather Seal and us and Weather Seal and the subcontractors.  Overall, the end result of the work I am happy with it all looks great.  I haven't had it long enough to speak to how it holds up during heavy rain or any issues regarding their warranty.

Would I recommend them to someone?  No, probably not at this time.
Would I use them again?  Maybe.  I think if they got things straightened out regarding communcation and cleanliness I could give them another chance to prove themselves to me.  I would prefer to talk directly to a Weather Seal employee rather than subcontractors as well.",0.0

"I had quite a bit of work done on my BMW M3 with the previous owner.  After Kent, the new owner took over, I got flyer in the main informing me of the owner change with a coupon for a certain % off.  I was in need of the expensive valve adjustment so I went and had that done.  I talked to Jason about also replacing the rear quarter window exterior lower molding.  He said it would be no problem.  A tool that they use of the valve adjustment broke so I had to go back again for the valve adjustment after they got a new tool.  I didn't complain about this as it cost me more for a rental car.  After getting the car completely done, I noticed a small scratch creeping out from under the new molding they had installed.  Unfortunately, it was right where you would always see it on the drivers side.  Kent and Jason were very accommodating, calling over Enrique who did the work which he then said he may have done it.  At that point Kent told me to go out to a body shop in Mesa which he has a relationship with and get them to take care of it.  Kent assured me that they are BMW certified and all.  After following up several times, finally I learned that Kent was not willing to pay for whatever Red Mountain Collision wanted.  At that point, Kent told me he would look into finding more of a ""touch up"" guy to do the work.  After following up twice, he still had not found anyone.  What a surprise!  I then found a place I had used before recommended by Chapman BMW, Ultimate Touch Ups.  I got a quote from them and again he was not happy with the price.  Next he got some buddy who was a custom car painter to attempt to repair it there at Autobahn.  I rented a car.  Apparently, that didn't work and they took the car to some other body shop and got it fixed.  It looked great except that when the stuck the new molding back down, it was off by about 1\/4 inch to the front of the car and caused interference while opening and shutting the door.  When I showed Kent this he got belligerent.  He made comments about how my car wasn't perfect anyway and couldn't believe I was complaining about 1\/4 inch.  Hmmm... hope that wasn't his attitude while my valves were being adjusted!   It was a very awkward moment, myself and Kent arguing while Jason, level headed, was trying to calm the situation.  Eventually I just said I would take care if it myself.  And by the way, I'm looking at the car rental receipt right now which was $140.00 which I didn't have the heart to ask for at that time.  Kent is a not the right person to deal with the public.  His technician, Enrique used something metal to remove double face taped molding which was absurd.  If the couldn't do the job I would have done it myself but I would have used a plastic putty knife with some Goof Off and taken my time.  Now, I noticed that rusty water was running out from under that molding.  I bought a new molding to replace myself since it wasn't positioned correctly and underneath I found that it is gouged in several places down to bare metal.  I guess they did the bare minimum job to repair it.  I have pictures but do not see a way to attach them.  I wouldn't recommend Autobahn to even haul an outhouse down the street.  Here is an email from Kent when he was complaining about how much the touch up work would cost where he through in a comment about how I got a discount using the coupon he sent to me as if I shouldn't want my scratch fixed because I got the discount.  This is what you are dealing with folks!  He's quoting a discount on a $900 valve adjustment job.


Hello Rod,
Thank you for getting an Estimate for the chip repair.

I have a copy of the Original Repair Order and the total cost of the Left Side Window Molding was $146.57 and that's Parts & Labor (B1 Gasket Rail $28.84, B1 Outer Weather Gasket $46.48, Labor $71.25).  Also noted on the Repair Order #12579 I gave you a $150.36 DISCOUNT.

Hi Kent\/Jason,

I went to Ultimate Auto Touch-Ups today and got a quote which is attached.  I feel comfortable what they are going to do and believe they can get it back to nearly how it was before it was scratched.  However, in order to do that, I will need to remove the trim under the left side quarter window that you replaced.  Ultimate doesn't want to deal with removing that trim and since it is attached via adhesive, it cannot easily be lifted to get any paint under it.  I'll install a new one once the paint is completed.

She rolled her eyes at me and then proceeded to mutter something in her first language that had all the other techs giggling. Granted I know I look like I am 15 (actually almost 30), but it is still no way to treat a customer who wants a pedicure with a little extra. To top it off, my toes look terrible.

What I didn't care for was the food.  While they have a fairly limited menu to begin with, it was even more limited due to the fact their fryers were 'broken'.  Nearly half of the menu items we weren't able to order so I just ordered the O.G. Grilled cheese sandwich with the house seasoned chips (since fries were not available).  The grilled cheese lacked any gourmet aspect and the house seasoned chips were simply cheap store bought chips and sprinkled with pepper.

Their area of the strip center is full of litter, as their customers discard packaging on the sidewalks and parking lot coming out the door.  An unsavory element hangs around the store entrance late into the night.  It appears they resell cigarettes purchased on the reservation (to avoid the taxes legitimate businesses and smokers have to pay).  This is not a suitable business for this neighborhood center.

"While this hotel is amazingly located right in the middle of everything, with an amazing casino and food court, it is in need of room renovation. We paid $25 extra per night for a ""view"", which included a partially obstructed view of the Bellagio fountains BUT more so a direct line of sight with one of the Bally's towers. While we had an amazing time in Vegas (and enjoyed the casino floor of this hotel and its location on the strip very much!), the room quality was very poor and has not been renovated for 10+ years. Our room looked more like a motel 6, with wallpaper pealing, numbers falling off the outside, and patches in the carpet (not what I would expect from a place with such a high scale casino anchoring its hotel). From someone who stays in Vegas frequently, I would recommend the recently renovated Linq for the same price over this particular Caesars property. If only I could combine the casino quality of the Paris with the room quality of the Linq, then I'd be happy! Long story short... Don't pay for the ""view"" option on the standard room. I hear the ""red"" rooms with a view of the Eiffel Tower and pool are an excellent choice but can't speak to those from experience.",0.0

"So disappointed in the service. They have teenagers running the shop. When I went in to look for a cake for my husband and they had no suggestions.  When I asked to sample the cake I wanted to purchase she told me they could not. How do you expect to have customers spend 40 bucks on a cake but can not sample it. I'll stick with kreative cupcakes from now on!!! 

So this is the managers response. ( captioned below) They only had two selections for men one football cake and one golf! The manager was is the back of the store but claims he over heard the conversation. The young lady stated they sample cakes every hour and they also have mini cakes as well so why not sample a small price of cake for a paying customer. $ 40.00 is already pricy to not taste the cake you are going to purchase. Seem like their customer service model needs some work. Also I am not sure what ""private for now"" but ok lol 
The proper response should have been ""I would love for you to try our amazing cakes. let me know when you are available to come in so I can make sure that cake is on sample."" ( but like I said need more training on customer service skills) 

""Hello KS
I recall your visit very well as I was sitting at my desk behind the cafe doors when you visited and thus I overheard the entire exchange. As you know, but neglected to comment in your review, you were offered a sample to try, but you declined because it was not the flavor you wanted. You were treated kindly and with respect by our GSR and offered multiple options for your husbands cake. Also, as I am far from a teenager in age and was there, I know teenagers are not running the shop. I was the person you spoke with when you called back to complain. At that time, I also apologized for your experience but tried to explain why we can't sample more than one flavor at a time. As I see this, for the simple reason that we only sample one cake flavor at a time and it didn't happen to be the flavor you wanted to try, you have chosen to give an intentionally harmful and distorted review. People love our cakes because it is simply the best cake they have ever had and our GSRs always treat our guests kindly, respectfully and with warmth. Having said that, I also know we won't please everyone so I sincerely hope you find what you're looking for elsewhere. I will leave this response to you private for now.",0.0

"The only reason I'm writing this review is because their service has definitely declined recently. A few of us went in 45 minutes before Iftar. The two of us that had arrived placed our order and told the server ""please come back when our other two friends arrive to take their order as they are fasting as well"". The other two came after ten minutes and the server was no where to be seen. She never checked up on us even once until one of us had to get up physically and ask them to take the orders. The fact that we had arrived 45 minutes early, yet the server didn't have the courtesy to check back even though we mentioned we were fasting is a bit ridiculous. At this point, two of us received our food and the other two didn't get served until 9:30 HALF AN HOUR AFTER IFTAR EVEN THOUGH WE CAME EARLY???? They didn't even seem apologetic and we literally had to get up two times to say ""hey we're fasting can you guys see where our food is"". The fact that they prestige themselves as a halal restaurant yet they couldn't even offer a glass of water or an appetizer (like other restaurants definitely do if their service is slow (read: bad) was highly disappointing. I've been to a plethora of restaurants in the GTA and I've never felt this way before. I get that it's a lounge and it's meant to be laid back and laissez faire, however, I feel that that should not take away from the professionalism and customer service of the restaurant. In addition, we had like three servers, which isn't what you expect in a ""higher end"" kind of place. It kind of felt like everyone was all over the place and could not care less about the customers. This kind of attitude is okay for the shisha lounge area, but I don't believe it's suitable when you're actually there to dine and sitting in the dining area. At the end of it, we had all paid our bills and didn't receive a receipt - at which point we realized we all paid a lot. Between the four of us we paid around $140, which didn't make sense considering the food and shisha we got. We decided to do the math and realized that we had all been overcharged. At this point, I decided to call them and let them know, but the ""manager"" gave me attitude, instead of being apologetic. We trusted them enough by not asking for a receipt, yet we felt like they exploited us. They charged us 15% gratuity on everyone's bill even though it was four of us - on top of which we also tipped. The biggest issue here is not about the few dollars in change, it's about principle. The server should have at least let us know before charging us for gratuity that is supposed to be charged on five people or more (so the guy on the phone claimed) WE WERE ONLY FOUR. I'm sure the server could count to four lol. On top of that, the service was way below average so we were nice to even give a tip. At any restaurant I've been to, they let you know beforehand about gratuity, instead of just charging you. We weren't even supposed to be charged it.... 

That being said, the shisha was good, so no complaints there. I would only recommend this place for shisha, not for food. The management should really think about creating some sort of an organized structure, instead of being so laid back in their customer service and attention to detail while charging people.",0.0

Here's the thing with SanTan: They're consistently inconsistent. (Which has been consistently mentioned in many previous reviews.) On a good day, they're firing on all cylinders, the service is good, the beers are good, and the food comes out tasty and nearly approaching its frankly ridiculous price point. On a bad day, they're slow and inattentive, the food's barely edible, and the beer is disappointing or short-poured. 

Even on their good days, though, they're a little shy of great. We're talking, after all, about a brew pub where you have to ASK for the seasonal specials. Go anywhere else and the first thing they pimp is whatever's new and interesting. Go to SanTan and you probably won't even know they're running seasonal brews, seasonal food, or a new pilot series beer.

The location is great. It's near public transportation, and near enough to interesting things that I spent a couple of afternoons just walking places from the hotel. The rooms were quite nice, attractive but a little dated.

One elevator, out of two in the building, didn't work the entire time I was there. I saw a few reviews mentioning this on Yelp before I went, but I didn't think it would be a big deal. It actually is a big deal because of the nightclub on the roofdeck. There was a twenty minute wait Saturday night to get on an elevator filled with drunk glittery people who rolled their eyes and muttered obscenities because they had to stop at my floor on the way up.

The rooftop bar and club is the part of my stay I feel weirdest about. As a guest, I was allowed use of the bar and rooftop deck. On Tuesday my beau and I sat, drank, talked, and enjoyed the view until, without warning, they kicked us out. 

The waitress suddenly decided to tell us that every table was SUPPOSED to be marked reserved, even though none were, and even though she had been serving us for an hour and a half where we were sitting without objection. The people who had ""reserved"" our table had just arrived, she told us, and so we had to go. We were nicely but not fancily dressed, but the people getting our seats were ostentatiously wealthy, which I think is why we were asked to leave.

If she had told us right when we sat down that the table was reserved, that would be one thing. What stung was the painful obviousness of the lie. We complained at the front desk, and the bar manager said he would refund our drinks for that night, but then when we examined the bill at home, we found he had not. (After complaining again over the phone they did remove the charges.) I know this seems nitpicky, but we paid for that room with the understanding that we would be allowed to use that beautiful rooftop bar.

"I went into the salon today with a coupon for a fill for $12.99. As soon as I sat down the woman told me my total would be $18. I presented the coupon and showed her that it said $12.99 for a fill. She said it would be $16 because the coupon only gave a $2 discount. I asked why the coupon did not say ""$2 dollars off"" instead and she made me move to her husband's station. He is the owner and told me that this time the fill would be $16 but next time I came in he would do it for $10... I asked him if he saw the coupon and he said yes but it would be $16 still. I asked why he wouldn't honor the coupon and he ignored my question but told me to come back so he can do it for $10. I asked him to give me back the coupon since he would not honor it and he said it was gone. 

This was annoying. Why advertise one price, not honor it, then offer me a cheaper price in the future upon my return? No consistency whatsoever.

"I bought a $50 watercolor pallet a week ago. I decided I did not like the solid cakes and came in a few days ago with my unused set (the only cake I used was the white one) and receipt looking to do an in-store exchange for watercolor tubes. I was told by one employee that if I replaced the white cake, that I could do the exchange. So the next day (yesterday) I drove all the way to the art store WITH THE REPLACED WHITE CAKE only to be told by a manager that I could not do the exchange because I ""took the plastic coverings off the cakes and did not have the box it came in. Store policy blah blah blah."" (I understand store policy but I was told one thing one day and a different thing the next day, not cool.)

"I've been here twice. Last time we were here, the food was horrible especially the pho and the fried spring rolls. I want to give it a second try, so I came again, pho was a little better this time, but nothing special, definitely not worth the price. Also there don't have fried quails on their menu, something I always order when I go to a Vietnamese restaurant. Will not return again. One thing that's good about this place is that the service is good, the dining atmosphere is probably a little better than the other two Vietnamese restaurants on South Blvd. They also take Amex, which is a plus.

The donut was not a donut. It was cake in the shape of a donut. No, not a cake donut.... Cake!! This has become some what of a pet peeve of mine with being gluten free.

"I like Roberto's Taco Shops a lot. I look forward to Wednesday nights when I can get a couple of $0.99 chicken tacos. And an order of three rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese. Those are a little more but oh so worth it. This has become a Wednesday night tradition for me. This past Wednesday was no different. What was different about this latest visit was the location. I came to the shop on Russel Road at Boulder Highway as I was in the area. I got my usual order as outlined above and eagerly awaited my mid week treat. The shop was busy this night as is often the case on cheap taco night so it took a few minutes to get my food. I was never disappointed with what I ate though there were some differences from what I am used to. The rolled tacos with guacamole were fine. Crispy and all. The guacamole seemed thin and bland compared to other Roberto's locations. The cheese was pleantiful but not at all melted. The tacos had more chicken than what I get at other shops. That was nice. They were actually pretty solid. What I did not care for as much is the amount of black pepper in the chicken. It was a little heavy handed for me. Regardless, I still enjoyed my meal. My reasoning for a 3-star rating is for the restaurant itself. It seemed dark. Dimly lit if you will. With the area it is in and some of the scary looking people around, I felt a little uncomfortable. Also, when I was ordering, I saw young girl of about 4 or 5 running around the back of the kitchen barefoot. I'm pretty sure she was the child of one of the workers. Perhaps the manager even. But I also fairly certain it is not OK. A child should not be roaming a restaurant at all. Let alone doing it barefoot. Surel there was an office she could have sat in if they had no place else for her. I don't know. That just bothered me.

"Worst dining experience ever! Deserve 0 star out of five. 11 of us went for winterlicioux last night. We were sitted at 7pm, our main dish was not even ready by 10pm. We complained to the manager, the manager offered a 50% off the entire meal and promised food will be here in exactly 15 minutes. 25 minutes later..when it finally come, the orders were all messed up, the waiters( not the one whotook our orders, that one disappeared) have no idea who ordered what, and lied to our face that is our order. When questioned why my medium rare steak is more burnt than my friend's medium well, the waiter still insist the all burnt steak is medium rare. My friend and i decided to switch, so we each get our required steak. The steak tasted awful!!! It doesnot taste any flavor, and its COLD!!!!! I think they dont know how to handle a large table, so they couldnot coordinate the timing for all main dishes to be ready at the same time.its much worse than the $15 steak in any bar. Not only it taste awful, my stomach started feeling uncomfortable right after eating. Waking up this morning, still having stomach pain. For deserts, the cheesecake is fair, quality comparable to the frozen one from supermarket. I just dont understand why my piece didnot come when everyone else is here, when it's clear they were just cutting slides from a big cheesecake.

When the bill came, it was full price with no discount at all..When my friend asked to see the manager, our waiter, who disappeared the entire night and finally showed up, said ""i cannot chase him around"".

"This is a review of good service recovery after a very poor customer experience.

In mid-June I had a very bad service experience at this store.  In fact, I left the store in tears because I was so incensed.  This experience was shocking because I've consigned and bought at this store several times - all pleasant experiences. 

The situation was triggered by the company's computer issues.  the computer had wiped out my transaction history and showed I had zero credit due when in fact I knew I had over $200 in store credit.  Staff and store management's attitude was ""you'll just have to wait until the new system is up and running sometime in July to see if the correct records show up.  If the records then still show a zero balance, oh well.""

There was no proactive offer to research the situation. The onus was on me, the customer, to figure out where my money had gone.  As stated earlier, I was incensed!

After cooling off for a couple of days, I sent a message to the corporate office through their website describing my issue.  Much to my pleasant surprise I got a call from the corporate office within 2 days promising to research the computer problem and get back to me asap.  They also apologized for my treatment at the store.

Bottom line - after 2 additional phone calls from the office the error was found and the money restored to my account.  One of the founders and a co-owner of the company contacted me personally to apologize and explain what had happened.

"We *love* Greek food and were thrilled to try Poros!  Reserved a lunch table through Open Table app...no issues upon arrival and was seated promptly.  Server was efficient and friendly, no concerns there.  Menu looked very good and I decided on the 3 course Prix Fixe (horiatiki salad, pastisio and baklava ice cream).  

The salad was excellent, though smaller than I'd have liked.  I could overlook that, though, given that it was exactly like the salads I had in Naxos, Greece.  The feta was creamy, the tomatoes, cukes and peppers were at room temp, nice oregano and oil throughout.  One kalamata olive though.  :  (    

Pastisio is my favorite Greek dish...so comforting and warm.  Poros' pastisio is lamb based, and I was surprised to see pieces of lamb instead of the regular ground meat.  From there, it went a bit downhill.  There was one scant later of tube pasta atop the lamb and the sliced tomatoes (also a Poros twist), and that was topped by a further scant later of bechamel (touted as allspice bechamel on the menu).  The bechamel and pasta had solidified into one firm, thin later devoid of any flavor at all.  HUGE disappointment.  Bechamel should be lovely and fragrant and creamy...and far more than a 1\/4"" layer.  Being a traditional comfort food, I can't see how you can leave out the pasta, either.  The lamb was cooked excellently - no fat, no gristle, very tender...but, It wasn't seasoned at all.  Much room for improvement in this dish.  With lamb of that quality, it could be a standout.

The star of the show was the baklava ice cream.  Cinnamon based with pieces of honeyed phyllo throughout.  Topped with what I can only describe as a baklava crisp, it was absolutely scrumptious.

"Within hours of posting my review, I received a call from the restaurant. I simply declined a gift card, as I had purchased one at another restaurant in Sewickley. There was no attempt to discuss how to better this process to ensure this doesn't happen to another consumer. Regardless, I was planning to update my review and rating given they at least followed up, and would have amended it had I eaten there.  However, today I received an angry message that alluded to my assumed private conversation with whomever called me last week.  Given that, I think it's reasonable to assume it is from someone closely associated with or employed by the restaurant. I was told whomever called me was on vacation. Though, unless the restaurant was totally closed, a lack of response seems a tad bit unreasonable, especially when the site implies a quick response. Had complete closure been the actual case, I'd be more than happy to delete my review as I would feel it was unreasonable to leave it. But, today's message made me reconsider.  Because I don't believe in criticism without solution, I will offer some helpful suggestions: 1) Please send a message to a consumer if you are in fact on vacation or the restaurant is closed (or update the website). 2) Or, please recognize you offer a service that you should honor (""A Vivo Kitchen representative will contant you as soon as possible."" You may also want to edit that.)  3) Ask your consumers how to improve. Regardless, these sorts of messages (in a form of a compliment, thank you!) has ensured that I will maintain a 1-star review.

I can't stand how taco bells everywhere are giving you no food at all, advertising that their food is something it isn't, and still charging you an exorbitant amount for what you're actually getting. I can get a 3.75 6 inch at subway versus a 3.29 quesarito. The difference? The six inch has flavors, and the bread to food proportions actually allow for you to taste it. Not to mention I'd need 3 quesaritos to fill me the equivalent of a six inch. I sure liked the flavor of taco bell when there was one, now I'm forced to eat subway, Arbys, and I'll even go far out of my way to just eat chipotle over this disappointment of fast food.",0.0

"So we visited Thyme 2 today after international fest. I would give 3 and 1\/2 if yelp allowed half star ratings. 

The Good - food was more than decent. The Mediterranean pizza was yummy, the special which was a chicken sandwich was very good. My salad (once I had dressing) was good. They have beer on tap so that's always nice! 

The not-so-good - 
1) our waiter seemed to be very unhappy having to be there. It dampens the experience and puts the group in a worse mood. Don't be a waiter if you can't at the very least be kind to people who haven't done anything to deserve your attitude. 
2) they cleaned the tables with a very strong smelling disinfectant. Not appetizing at all. 
3) over salted French fries. They were good just tone it back a tiny bit. 
4) my salad (the mixed green) needs to have more dressing. It tasted like there was a table spoon on there... Maybe.

The atmosphere is nice, especially on a lovely day, and they have a nice liquor selection. However, the service and meal prep is really lacking, and it's overpriced. I recently ordered takeout, while I waited, and they tried to give me the wrong order. My order had apparently already been given to someone else who ordered takeout. On another occasion, I ordered the dip trio. At $8.50, I was surprised to see that I received hummus, carrot dip, and plain greek yogurt. The plain yogurt is obviously not the correct dip! Also, unless you ask for extra pita bread, you'll receive only 6 or so little squares to go with it- and the pita bread is just standard frozen delivery stuff.",0.0
I really don't appreciate the service I received at this car rental place. I had reservations for a full size car. The attendant at customer service was rude. I was never told I had to print my flight info and bring it in when renting. So I had to pay $5.65 to use Avis computer and print it out. I have rented here before a few months ago with no problems. That's the only reason I came back. So after signing all the paper work. I find out they have no full size car. The lady told me that I would have to wait 25 minutes. OK Fine...I'm waiting. About 20 minutes later she gives me keys to a Rav 4 which is not a full size car it's a down grade. I asked her why can't she upgrade me instead. I ended up paying full size price for an  intermediate size instead. No discount at all! This was not what I paid for. She told me bring the car back and trade it in tomorrow. This place is a joke. Never again. You just lost another customer.,0.0
"I just relocated from Chicago and desperately needed a barber. I went into Ffloyds and was recommended to Kris. I'm a black woman and I have the hardest time getting my cut right. Kris was honest with me. He explained that he could cut my hair but we would have to work on the style together. He did a great job with my cut. He kept it feminine and classy. I would definitely recommend Kris because he is great with clippers and trimmers. Unfortunately Ffloyds doesn't offer anything in terms of black hair styling products, so be prepared to go home and work out your own style. But I loved my cut and I really liked working with Kris. I assumed they would be able to handle my type of hair (products and styling) because of the black artists plastered all over the walls. It's not a ""welcome"". It's just the decor.

"Came in today for lunch and waited 36 minutes in line. I know specifically how long because I took a phone call when I walked in and when I finally got to the front looked back to see when it was. The staff was not trained properly but no one was on the line directing them, they definitely had enough hands just not using them to their advantage. I.e. 3 people on toppings and 1 setting up tacos\/tortillas. The girl would never use the second warmer she would wait for the first tacos to be warm before starting another. This was the biggest reason why it took so long to get through the line. I watched people walk out. After all that wait I wanted a grilled fish taco and had to wait again because it came from the back. The barrier is too high and you had to yell over it and repeat what you wanted so they could hear you. I also ordered a carnitas taco and the carnitas meat was very dry and chewy like it sat on the line for too long. I know they are new so I will try again in a few months but they need to get it together... And quick.",0.0

I told the first guy several times I am not buying today and I do not want my car appraised. He insisted that he had to get information on me first before he could show me the cars. I should have just left at that point. He asked me the same questions over and over again about buying today and having my car appraised. Then the sales manager had to get involved because I was leaving. Listen up idiots - if someone says they are not buying today then listen to them. They are part of the Van Tuyl group which is now owned by Berkshire Hathaway but still run by Van Tuyl. That means there shady business practices are the same.

It is now May 4th, 2015 and we still have no part.  I just spoke to Jerry at Runyon to find out where our part was and he says it is at least 3 days out and he could not give me a guaranteed date.

"I'm giving this place two stars because the food truly is good if you don't have to wait an hour to get it. Ordering is hard when you encounter rude customer service from someone who has clearly worked here too long. If she is part of the family she should reconsider cooking in the kitchen instead of dealing with customers after reading all of these reviews.  Unfortunately being rude to people won't make people continue to support this business. We were brought the wrong drinks after waiting 15 minutes to get them. And waited so long that we came to eat breakfast and it ended up being lunch. Don't come here if you are trying to do anything the rest of the day. I normally don't leave any reviews that are negative because I prefer to support the positive experiences I have but this was way too ridiculous. And I actually just dropped it down to one star because while trying to get my Togo order they didn't want to give me another drink because their dr pepper syrup ran out and the lady said ""it's the gas all of the soda is going to taste like that...""

"Aria is one of my favorite places in Vegas. But we had a bad experience there at the Alibi lounge.

On the first day, we visited the Alibi Lounge in the afternoon and had a wonderful time. We just had two drinks at the lounge - one being my favorite - a Rum Runner. They made it very special, with fresh squeezed blackberry juice and a frothy top - none like I ever had before. It was the best Rum Runner I ever had.

Returned on Day 2 for the same. About 6:00, right after dinner. The service this time sucked - we sat there over 15 minutes watching the server walk by repeatedly, looked at us, but ignored us. Frustrated and tired of being ignored by the server, we went to the bar directly to order our drinks. My wife ordered her drink; I asked for the same Rum Runner. This other bartender made a disappointing normal version with grenadine. We asked why it wasn't made the same way as the day before, and he said ""there are many ways to make it"". I tasted it, it was not good. He charged us $30 for two drinks. Yup - 30 friggin dollars for two crappy drinks and over 15 minutes of being ignored. I had much better drinks for half that price at other places.

At one point, a guy that looked like a manger walked by and asked ""everything ok?"" - I said no, as he just kept his pace and walked past, not even stopping to talk with me. 

We finished our drinks rather quickly, and saw a gentleman come sit at the table in front of us. He was there no longer than two minutes when the server showed up and served him immediately. Don't understand why she was too busy to serve us and not too busy for him. I guess they are very selective on who they choose to serve.

This was was a very disappointing and upsetting experience just for a simple drink - rude bartender, server that ignored us, extremely expensive and crappy drink. We won't be back here after learning this expensive lesson - Alibi lounge just plain sucks in service, price and quality. Move on to the Cosmo instead.",0.0
"Bite is cute. We had really nice friendly service. It's a laid back atmosphere that's very family friendly. 

The portions are huge. We shared the banana nut french toast combo and the chicken fried steak. We took 2\/3 of the french toast home. It was scrumptious but cold. The chicken fried steak was literally a breaded and fried steak so the texture was tough but the flavor was outstanding. The bacon\/sausage gravy was yummy but salty. Everything is certainly homemade and they have a big menu to choose from. There is no specialty coffee which is always disappointing at a breakfast establishment. People need lattes!

"They messed up our entree twice, and the second time we suspected it wasn't even cooked through. Both entrees were barely edible. Was debating giving 2 stars because they threw out the bill after the second mess-up, the drinks were strong and the appetizer (blue corn pancake with duck) was tasty. Still, there's no excuse for a dinner that would be in the $100 range to be completely inedible. Was the first time in my life a restaurant failed so badly they threw out the bill.

We went last week and started with a Partida Margarita and prickly pear one. Both drinks were pretty good, very strong. Definitely didn't taste like typical mix. Pear one was a very pretty purple and came in a decent-sized glass, the Partida came in a thinner margarita glass.

They switched waiters on us like four times throughout the dinner, which was fine because it meant the service was always prompt.

The blue corn pancake with duck was delicious, but they do stress how small it is. Imagine a thin, crispy crepe about the size of your palm, filled with shredded duck meat. Still, it had a rich but not overwhelming sauce, and was cooked to be tender and flaky. Very well prepared.

For an entree, I ordered the mango chicken with some pesto mashed potatoes, and my girlfriend ordered a tuna steak done medium-well with, I believe, a risotto. 

For the tuna steak, it was a hearty chunk on top of the risotto. The risotto was rather tasty. The steak, however, was overcooked and completely dry and gray inside. We called the waiter and he immediately agreed it was way overcooked from a glance. He took it back for us, saying he would ask them to cook it Medium instead of Medium-well, in hopes that maybe it would be just right.

The chicken came served with the potatoes and two good-sized chicken breasts, it actually looked really good, and the couple next to us commented on it. It was completely dry, though. I couldn't really taste the sauce. It was blackened, and tasted very much so. The ""mango"" sauce was mostly sticky-sweet sauce with a tiny dash of spice. It could as well have been store-bought stir fry sauce. Between the two of us, we ate half of one breast while we waited for her dish to come out, and by then I was growing kind of unhappy as I realized we just ate the juiciest part and it was only getting drier the further we went, and the taste of the charred bits was becoming the most overpowering flavor.

I gave the potatoes a shot, but they were very boring and pretty uncomplimentary to the chicken.I munched on them while we waited for her steak to finish. The potatoes themselves were plain, and the pesto drizzled in was... essentially just olive oil with some basil in it. The sauce was very runny, didn't taste like nutty, and I couldn't see any grains to it. Overall, it tasted like mashed potatoes with oil-drenched basil in it.

Her steak came back and it was now undercooked. It was so wet and blubbery she struggled to cut through it, and it kept sliding around on the plate. ANOTHER waiter (not our own) actually walked by as she was cutting it open, and made a face at it, asking if we would like it to be cooked a bit more before we even asked. Meaning it was probably not even cooked through. 

She gave him the plate but at that point we were so disgusted we just asked our waiter to bring our check. I rejected a box, and he inquired why, so I explained that I didn't like my dish.

A moment later, JP, the manager walked by and apologized to us, letting us know there wouldn't be a bill. He asked for any comments, and we explained to him that both the appetizers and drinks were delicious, but the entrees were inedible. He offered us free drinks ""to go"" but we declined them.

All reptiles are on loose substrate wich can cause impaction - and majority of the bedding used can get moldy quick, especially in humid conditions.  They feed crickets to herbivores (like iguanas - they eat veggies only not bugs), when veg is provided for herbivores it's always frozen mixed (corn,carrots, green beans), which has no nutritional value for the animals.  Prices for livestock are way too high.  Save yourself money and heartache, go to Reptile Rapture, they will do right by you.

Fish Department: dismal.  Fish that shouldn't be together are together, giving people new to the hobby a false impression of what is safe to put together. Aptasia is rampant in their live rock, tanks need scrubbing desperately, tanks all tied to one central filtration unit.

Bird department:  Live stock extremely overpriced, and larger birds are longing for interaction.  When they do take parrots out, most times they are on a stand behind the front counter, more or less left to their own devices.  Very little in the amount of toys are provided, birds look bored and lonely (that's why we rescued a large bird from there).  More toys need to be provided, these birds NEED enrichment, otherwise they start screaming and plucking feathers.

Small animal department:  Let's just not even go there....

Although they have a wide selection of products, many times it can be found elsewhere for much less (Lafebers AviCakes for example...8.99 for parrot and 12.99 for cockatoo sizes.  I can get both at Animart for 6.99 each).  They need to shop their competitors to see what they should be charging.  Most supplies I buy from either other local competitors or online.  They won't survive much longer if they don't take a good hard look at their pricing policies!",0.0
"I'll start by saying we've been going to the Esplanade for years, even before it was a Dine-In theater but we've experienced the Cinema Suites side 24 times now (by looking at my AMC Stubs) since it became Dine-In.  It was great when it first opened and I would even say up until this last year.  We moved to Florence a year ago and even still we drive out to Phoenix just to come to the Esplanade for a night out of dinner & a movie.  The movie quality is consistently good but I have got to say, if you are going there for the novelty of eating dinner while you watch a movie....just don't waste your money.  Or order popcorn or some candy, something that they cannot screw up.

This last visit on 8\/11\/15 might very well be our ""last"" visit to this theater.  The chairs were dirty and even had popcorn still sitting on the seat, not even brushed off.  The menus were sticky and\/or slimy depending which page you were on, just absolutely filthy.  Our server did do a good job, so I have no complaints about him and the tip we left reflected his job but definitely not the food quality.  We ordered an appetizer and dinners x 3.  My friend ordered the tenderloin tips which he said were very much over cooked.  I ordered chicken tenders which honestly, how do you screw up chicken tenders?  Apparently if you want to find out, contact whoever works the fryer at AMC Esplanade.  The ""tenders"" were rock hard, overcooked chunks of chicken jerky.  I'm not expecting 5 star quality food, but when you spend $90 (including tip) for an appetizer, 3 dinners and 3 non-alcoholic drinks, you should get something a little higher quality than ""I'm too drunk to taste this"" greasy bar food.

The only positives and which is why I'm giving them two stars is for movie choices\/quality, ability to pre-purchase seats (reserved seating) and our servers have been helpful.",0.0
"Since it was our first visit to Mt Charleston we decided to visit the forest after breakfast. Their website advertises a ""Hiking Boxed Lunch"" for $14.95 available at the restaurant.  So we asked our server if we could order the boxed lunch.  The server had no clue and sent the manager who first thought we had paid with some package deal and then found out that we did not.  Either way, she informed us that we had to give 24 hours notice, which meant we had to order the food before we even drove up or checked in!  If we had known that, we would have brought our own lunch especially since there are no stores nearby. We told the manager that their website does not have that pre-order prerequisite but it is only a ham or turkey sandwich, chips, fruit, and bottle water. She informed us that the cook did not have those supplies ready.  After a few moments,  the manager said they would do it for us, but we were already unhappy and told her to forget it. They also had a car show there that used or saved almost all the parking spaces, especially the closer spots. The desk should have at least let us know ahead of time.  The mountains are beautiful but we will not stay there again. We will stay in Vegas and drive up.",0.0

"I work across the street and we usually order regularly from this place. The customer service has decreased lately each time we order for delivery ever since we stopped tipping the delivery guy. The reason for not tipping? Because he is very rude. Today (which will probably be the last time we're ordering from them) we specifically asked for 3 separate bills, but when he came to drop off the food, everything was on one bill and we wanted to pay separately. As I was getting my wallet to grab my credit card to pay, he grabbed my coworker's $20 bill out of her hand and just walked out...really?! That's how customers are treated here?! Ontop of that, the guy over the phone said our order will take 45 minutes...we didn't get our food until an hour and a half later. When we called back to ask where our food was, the guy over the phone said ""I don't know what happened I'm sorry""...WE ARE LITERALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LIGHT IN THE LOBLAWS PLAZA!! How can someone get lost or get stuck in traffic when we're literally across the street?! He could've walked faster than driving....Lastly, I like my egg rolls with the plum sauce. When our food arrived, all the plum sauce packets were opened\/pierced open. How can that be possible when the packets are sealed closed and the packaging is pretty strong unless if someone rips it themselves? I have never experienced this at any restaurant before and it's a shame because their food is pretty good along with the price. I DO NOT recommend this place! Might as well go elsewhere where you are treated properly by staff, rather than getting a bill grabbed out of your hand when you weren't ready to pay.",0.0

That being said my girlfriend and I didn't have the best experience here, nothing terrible happened but we came here based off the good reviews we had read on Yelp while we were looking for a place to get brunch.

So just to get the bad out of the way here's what made me take 2 stars off:
*we arrived and were told there would be a 25 minute wait (no biggie, that's common) or we could sit at the bar. Being pretty hungry we opted to sit at the bar with another couple. Now none of this is an issue, what was an issue was that there was about 1 or 2 empty, clean tables. Not really sure why we couldn't get seated at one of those? 

*After placing our orders we ended up having to wait about 30 minutes for our food. I typically don't have a problem waiting for food, but I did get irked when the couple who sat and ordered with us and another couple who came in after us go their food before we did. After we asked our server if he knew the status of our food, it came out about a minute later.

The Good:
The food was amazing, my bacon was chewy just the way I liked it, and my French toast was some of the best I had ever had and very filling. My gf and I both got pineapple mimosas (I wasn't a big fan because they were a little too sharp for me, but my gf loved it)

"We were in Vegas for a wedding and got a decent deal on the Monte Carlo. In general, the hotel was decent. Great location, good food options in the hotel itself. But I had a few gripes:

Check-In: Holy crap, get some more people up front to check people in! We arrived just before 2:30 and the line was already fairly long. It took us over a half hour to check in. There were only 3 people working the check-in, while there were 3 or 4 people working the concierge\/check-out line next door--with no one in line! Friends of ours showed up a few hours later and stood in line for over an hour to check in because there was only ONE person checking people in. Not acceptable. And when we finally checked in, we were told there were no more king beds available until the following day. Fine, whatever. Except our friends who checked in later that night got a king bed! 

Cleanliness\/Comfort: The rooms are old, outdated, and dingy. The old carpets were covered in stains. The beds were low and lumpy (although the pillows were soft). There was hair on the bathroom floor that clearly didn't belong to us. We also found a couple of bugs in our room.

"I called up during the week to book my dog, Tyson, into daycare on Sunday.  I was told that was fine and to drop him off between 7-10am and pick him between 4-7pm.  I dropped him off at about 9am and picked him up at about 5:30pm on Sunday, April 19th.  At pick-up, there were no staff present in the front office and I waited about 10 minutes before somebody came.  During the time that I waited I could not see Tyson on any of the playroom cameras.  When a girl finally came to the counter, she was pleasant but admitted they were short staffed.

She explained that Tyson had jumped several internal fences and as a result, they had to confine him to a cabin (with a roof).  She added that fence jumping was likely grounds for dismissal but that a manager would call me the following day. On arriving home, Tyson leapt out the car and headed straight for his water bowl where he drank 2 full bowls leading me to believe that he had limited or no access to water in the ""cabin"".

The following day, Margarita, the manager called me, as promised.  She informed me that Tyson had jumped internal fences and was therefore banned.  I asked Margarita to explain how Tyson could have jumped more than one fence if he was being supervised.  The manager explained that the facility was NOT staffed at night, dogs were left unattended and that Tyson had jumped the fence at night. I reminded her that Tyson had been there for daycare only and not overnight boarding.  The manager audibly confirmed my comments with someone else in the room before agreeing that he had been there for daycare only.  I returned to my original question about fence jumping and supervision and the manager explained that they did not offer daycare on Sundays and staff had been incorrect in letting Tyson in for this service on a Sunday but that their policy was never to turn a dog away (I guess this policy is regardless of sufficient staffing).  As a result, the manager advised me, they were short-staffed and Tyson was not always supervised.  

To summarize, Tyson was incorrectly admitted for a service they did not offer on Sundays, he was left unsupervised due to staffing issues and jumped fences looking for someone or something and was as a consequence, banned.

I'm okay with the manager's decision because I don't want my dog cared for by a facility whose staff do not know what services are offered on certain days, whose fences are to low, whose access to water for the dogs appears restricted and whose manager fails to inform herself of the facts before rendering down decisions.",0.0

If you are on a budget for food, there is an affordable food court on the second floor. Our room was decent although I wish the bedding was more than just a very thin blanket, if you could call it that.

"Similar to other Yelp reviewers, I felt like the women working in this store judged me from the moment I walked in. I had a bag of dresses and work suits only worn once or twice. The woman acted like she didn't even want to go through my stuff. I could tell then and there she wasn't going to buy any of it, but I went ahead with it anyway.

I filled out their form and said I'd just wait in the store until they were done. It wasn't busy and there was no one ahead of me. 

The woman quickly went through my stuff and then put it back in the bag and set it on the floor. She first made it seem like I brought it the worst kind of stuff, saying it was ""too well loved"" and that the shoes I brought in weren't up to their standard of ""looking like new."" 

I had good brands--j crew, cynthia rowley, Tommy Hilfiger, etc. 

It doesn't bother me that they didn't want to buy any of my stuff, but it does bother me that they treated me like some second class citizen. I was wearing workout clothes and no makeup, but that shouldn't matter. 

I left and took my stuff to near by Plato's Closet and Style Encore and they both thought I had really nice items and bought most of them.

"The businessman in front of me and I had to wait quite a while for the employee to come back to sell us bagels, and then she was grouchy and almost silent throughout. So that was weird.  On the bright side, Bruegger's has decent quality bagels for pretty cheap, and they don't drive up their prices just because you're trapped in the airport. A normal bagel, toasted with cream cheese, is under $4, and sandwiches are under $7, which isn't a bad deal.

We ordered food from the cafe area, we asked about mimosas and were told to order at the bar. After grabbing our order number we hung out at the bar waiting for the bartender to knowledge us. She looked a few times at us, was actively busy and moving around but didn't ask us if we needed something. Of course we were standing there not eating and just looking at the bar so it was obvious we needed assistance. She finally asked after a few minutes what we needed, and we said two mimosas and she rudely said we don't open till 11 but said ah ok and rudely shuffled to get the mimosa. The drinks were good but just a hassle to get. We know they open at 11am for lunch but when we were told it was okay to order mimosa at the bar then why do we get rude service for it? 

Once our food came out no one asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. Plenty of servers but no one acknowledging the customers.

"My boyfriend introduced me and my girls to this place 2 years ago. It became one of our Go To Places. The service, for the most part, was mediocre. Chasing your waiter to come take your order or get drinks isn't my ideal of great customer service. But we loved going because of the patio sitting and their delicious bean dip which used to be FREE! I understand times are hard and can't always have things for free but to start charging your customer $4.25 for a bean dip, it better come in a large bowl that feeds more than 3 people! If anything, there should be free refills! Otherwise change your price. I never knew refried beans were so costly! You're better off ordering your meal which gives you their rice and beans...and not waste your money on the $4.25 over charged bean dip.  #MediocreService #WhatWasOnceFree #OverPricedBeanDip #ValleLuna",0.0

The toilet didn't work when we finally got to the room and the cups were extremely dirty. Wouldn't stay here again. Ever. On top of that att signal barley works and the damn made came at 9 am knocking on the door. Cars in the parking lot get hit and broken into and all I heard were car alarms all night .

"I visited The Yard for the first time for a business lunch yesterday and I'm still not totally sure what I think.

The location is on the second floor of the building, with a dark stairway leading up.  If anyone in your party has any mobility challenges, this is not the place for you. It was packed, even before the noon rush, but we were able to get a seat without a reservation.

The service was overly attentive, though I guess that I would prefer that to inattentive, particularly at the lunch hour when you're trying to get back to the office.  My dining companion was asked at least 3 times if she was done with her tomato soup (she was not!).  The check was on our table shortly after our entrees were delivered (I do not mind this for lunch, but it did feel like we were being pushed).

The food was fair.  It didn't knock my socks off, but it wasn't bad.  I had the Young Cheezy (minus the onions).  The bread was nicely toasted and held up well.  For a place that specializes in grilled cheeses, they sure skimp on the cheese (I noticed other reviews mentioning this).  The chorizo and potato hash on the sandwich had good flavor, but the chorizo could've been cooked a bit longer to give it better texture.

The grilled cheeses all come with tomato soup and potato chips.  The tomato soup was good, but the vessel that it is served in is rather small.  It is too narrow to effectively dip your grilled cheese - which is the best part of grilled cheese and tomato soup!  There are several flavors of potato chips to pick from.  I chose the garlic parm.  The chips were good (obviously homemade), but really, they just shook a canister of Kraft parmesan cheese over them and called it a day.  There was no hint of garlic whatsoever, and the cheese was only on the very top few chips.

The entrees are creatively named, but awkward.  Who wants to order a ""Smack Yo Mama"" in front of a business contact or boss?

Since this place is still pretty new, I'll definitely try it again.  I also wish that they offered a more simple grilled cheese as an option. Sometimes that would hit the spot!",0.0

The eggs were bland, and Cholula and salt only helped so much.

"Beautiful atmosphere. Has a private room for parties.  Craft beer selections from house and local brewers. Flight was presented beautifully. 
Decided to go while in Cleveland on business.

Poutine was just ok. (The reason we chose this place along with the beer) Made ""lighter"" with chicken gravy...hmmm, ok. It was good, but not awesome.

Got roasted eggplant sandwhich and fries. Prefer to order vegetarian dishes when possible since I cook at home, but rarely vegetarian. My husband is definately a carnivore. Eggplant was tough and bread was overly oily, but obviously started as great crusty bread. Had to deconstruct to eat. Fries, were seasoned well, but a very small portion. Same fries used in the poutine, which kind of disappointed me.Left me wanting more food for the price.

The main dining room was almost all hightop tables with tall stools. For a short person these are not comfortable. The tables that were not hightops had ""Reserved"" signs on them, but were not seated while we were there. They could have been seated and turned. For some reason there was not salt and pepper on the tables. I have worked with chefs before that saw S&P on the tables as insulting, but come on...you serve burgers, get off it. Whether it was a front of the house oversite or not, it took an act of congress to get salt, which the poutine was in dire need of. The server was sweet, but forgot our requests.

It is fall in Cleveland, so why was the front door propped open? Was not only cold on my back and legs but cooled our food quickly. The husband was on the other side of the table, so I didnt mention it to him. He was happy to get his beer. 

It was quite a walk  through people pan handling.I'm no judge, and have fallen on hard times myself, but I must admit, it was off- putting. Not the fault of the establishment, just a heads up for safety. A few people were very rude when i ran out of pocket cash.

Took the car in for an oil change appt.  I asked if it can be done in an hour because we had to be somewhere else.  Should not be a problem, the lady at the counter said.  An hour later, asked why it has not been done yet.  They are waiting on a filter that somebody is supposed to deliver.  Meanwhile, the old oil was already drained but the new oil has still not been added in.  Husband asked why the work was started if it was not sure the job can be finished.  Tech reasoned, well, he did not know there was going to be an issue until he started work on it.  Ok.  Husband wanted to ask if there is anything that can be done so we can leave and come back for the filter or something.  Guy at the counter started being rude, raising his voice.  He says my husband was harassing them, that we should just stay put, we were never promised a 20 min oil change and that we are paying $40 for a $70 oil change.  If this is the manager at this auto center, he should learn something about customer service.  

1. I don't think it was unreasonable to follow-up on a task that was promised to be done in an hour, especially since we are on a schedule and they were told that.    This guy was not even there when we checked in. 

2. Nobody was expecting a 20 min oil change. Again, we were there for an hour.  More than enough time to get an oil change done if that was all there is. The delay in work completion was because of a part they had to have somebody get.  The least a manager can do is be apologetic about it.  

3. We used a groupon offer for a year of unlimited oil change at autotech (which is what this place used to be).  We still have to pay the difference because of the synthetic oil upgrade.  Just because we are getting a discount, the business does not have a right to talk down like we are cheapskates.  If it is a worthwhile purchase, I wouldn't mind paying full price.  I would have just gone to the dealer , pay more but be treated respectfully.  But I thought, well, Autotech has provided good service and reasonable prices in the past 2 years, I should stick with them.  If you don't want groupon customers, then don't allow the appointment to be scheduled.  I don't need to be a patron.

It was in the ice cream when I got there so someone else had left it there. It was supposed to be in another dessert. The ice cream scoop was there in a bowl of water that looked filthy with the water and ice cream all melted together so I don't blame the previous customer for not using it. Either way the guy should have just moved the errant spoon and not criticized me, a paying customer, for using it.

And lastly, the Malaysian fried rice, it was probably the saltiest dish I have ever had in my life. The chef obviously put a handful of too much sauce... We basically took that whole dish home and re-cooked it.

My wife, her son and myself went here for lunch recently.  I and my wife ordered Thom Yum noodle soup with ground pork.  I ordered spice level 8 (range of 1 - 10) and my wife ordered level 7.  We also ordered Pud See Ewe with pork.

My noodle soup was NOT spicy and was NOT sour.  Both flavor's are essential for a dish to be considered Yum.  I would say the spice level was about 4, certainly not approaching an 8.  My wife's noodles were also remarkably mild.  The broth instead of being slightly sour was in fact somewhat sweet.  I had to request fresh limes to adjust the flavor to the sour side.  The waiter also did not bring the condiments (dry chilies, vinegar, fish sauce, pickled peppers, etc.) which allow the customer to tailor the flavor to their own taste.

The Pud See Ewe was stir fried with too much sauce and as a consequence was more moist than it should have been.  This dish should be fairly dry when prepared correctly.

"This review is for their service center.  

In 2014, a little over a year ago, I inherited a 2005 Touareg from my kind parents.  As a side effect, I also inherited the maintenance costs of the Touareg as well.  

AutoNation successfully changed my alternator and some belt related to the alternator, I believe, at a reasonable price (for a VW and a dealer).  I'd also had them do a few other repairs that came up, such as replacing one of the headlamps (which the manual strongly recommends not doing yourself, since they contain Xenon gas or something like that).  All of this stuff went just fine with them, warranting a 4 if not 5 star review.  

However, my most recent visit with them left me feeling very uneasy.  I had a warning light on that said there was an airbag fault.  When I brought it in to them, they told me that I had to do a $1000+ repair to fix the issue.  Their claim was that a component under the seat needed to be replaced, which is not totally out of the question, as this model did have a manufacturer recall within a year or two of building the car (so 2006-2007), to replace an airbag-related part under the seat.  However, 2 claims that they made on this visit did not correspond with my understanding of the Touareg nor with reality.  
(1) They claimed it would take over 5 hours of labor to remove the driver side seat (which is required to replace that component, if it needed to be replaced).  This seemed incorrect, since in previous work done when the battery was replaced (the battery is under the seat), 1 hour of work was billed.  So, even if that component needed replacement, trying to bill 5+ hours of labor seemed dishonest to me.  
(2) I asked ""Are you sure it needs replacement?  A VW person I spoke with said airbag faults can be reset in the ODB-2 and if the warning doesn't come back, you're going to be fine.  If it does, then of course you need to take action.""  They insisted ""Without a doubt, its going to come back anyway, so may as well just fix it now.""  Since $1000 is not chump change to me, I decided to go with my instincts and find out.  What I found was that, several months down the line, the issue has not resurfaced.  

The other thing I didn't like was how the rep tried to pressure me with fear of how dangerous driving without an airbag would be.  ""I'd hate it if you got into an accident and it was more serious because we didn't fix this.""  Yeah, of course, and so would I.  She mentioned it several times in a ""sales-y"" way, which honestly did not really correspond to my past experience with them.  

So, I still gave these guys 3 stars, because my previous work with them had been reasonable -- I'd realistically put it at 2.5 if we could give half stars.  But I didn't like feeling lied to.  

I know everyone makes mistakes, but a $1000 suggested repair that ended up not being actually a relevant issue at all, is kinda a big deal.  I'd like to keep using AutoNation, since they're a bit closer to me, and I was already comfortable using them, but its already been over 24 hours since I called them to try and come up with a reasonable compromise to make up for the last service they did for me without a call back, so I now have an appointment with Findlay to look at the current issues I'm having with the car.",0.0

"When people say ""Third time's the charm"", that is not the case all the time. Tonight was our third time coming here and we will never be back again. This place should be renamed to California Peanut House (See below for details).

SERVICE\/ATMOSPHERE
Friendly and attentive service. Interior is nicely decorated and very clean. I do think that they need to change their playlist. I personally think pop music didn't quite fit the ambiance of this place. I do have to say, music isn't a big issue at all. The biggest issue I have with this place is the food itself. 

FOOD
I would like to start by saying that the chef\/owner here must really love peanuts. Literally everything came with a peanut dressing on the side. Lettuce wrap, noodle house salad and even their garlic noddle. And sadly, their signature peanut dressing did not compliment any of these dish. 

Speaking of garlic noodle, why would they name a dish Garlic Noodle when I didn't even taste a hint of garlic? If they used any garlic, they probably used a speck of garlic. They need to consider renaming this dish to Peanut Noodle since the whole noodle appeared to have been drenched in a peanut sauce. 

Sashimi used in their Sashimi Salad is old. It did not taste fresh at all. Not worth $12.

Blackened Ahi: seared ahi with black bean sauce (thank goodness it's not peanut sauce), pineapple relish and roasted garlic rice. Again, they should consider revising their description to ""Dry ahi on uncooked tropical rice with a side of disappointment"". At this point, I don't know what garlic they are talking about because I did not taste a hint of garlic. Rice was uncooked and tasted so tropical (mango? pineapple?). ""Pineapple relish"" was unnecessary touch. I rather have garlic on the side than their pineapple relish. Not worth $20.

Even though my appetizer and main dish was disappointing, I did enjoy their Matcha Cheesecake and Mango Cheesecake. Matcha Cheesecake came with a chocolate sauce on top and was really good. Mango Cheesecake had tiny pieces of mango in the cheesecake, topped with mango sauce. Both were delicious but not worth $5 a piece.

"I liked my A\/C tech, and I thought the A\/C repair price was fair but their plumbing division is another story.  While I was having them install a water heater, and we were waiting for the old one to drain, I asked the tech to look at a small drip under the kitchen sink.  Turns out that the drain basket wasn't screwed in right so the tech unscrewed it, and screwed on another one. Took 5 minutes, and was probably the easiest thing the tech ever had to do.  The price?  $200!!  For a $5 basket and 5 minutes of easy labor that I could have done myself.  Considering that I was an existing customer and was having them install an overpriced water heater, the correct thing to do was to just charge me for the part and perhaps a minimal amount for labor.  If I was the tech, I would never have charged a penny to a loyal customer such as myself.  It's not like he had anything else to do while waiting for the old water heater to drain. Maybe that is old school but, in my mind, how do you keep customers if you rip them off?  As if I wasn't mad enough, one of their sales reps stopped by that very same day to give me an estimate on installing a water softener.  $4,500 quote, and that did not include an RO system.  Simple install because main water source was right on the outside of the wall where it would have been installed.  Just the loop needed.  Who charges $4,500 for just a water softener?

On to our appetizer and entrees.  We ordered a half a dozen of oysters that were prepared with pulpo (octopus) and crab ceviche type of thing.   They were very bland with no taste of seafood whatsoever and the crab of course was imitation crab these were served with some kind of  runoff liquid, gross.  At this point I was not looking forward to the rest of our orders, but they came out before I could finish with my thoughts.  I had the bandera burrito which came with carne asada, chorizo rice and beans, covered in some red and green tasteless sauce.  The chorizo totally overpowered the carne asada taste or anything else inside the burrito and was just not good at all.

"Sushi was good, it was dead at 4pm on a Monday, but we still didn't get very good service. We were checked on 2 times in the hour that we were there. Drinks sat empty for most of that time...

Food came out quick, we ordered 4 rolls and 3 apps.
My husband took my two oldest boys to run to Walmart and rent some movies and grab dessert for later tonight and while I tried to walk out with a drink, Togo box and my 18lb baby in his car seat, no one offered to hold the door while I struggled to get out. There was even a kid that works there that was washing the windows on the outside and he just stepped aside while he watched me try to come through the door.. Very rude I thought. I would have gotten the door, but maybe that's just how I was raised..

Food good, service not so good... Place is small but cute inside and you pay at the desk when you walk out, not at the table.

We ordered, chicken tempura, Chinese style dumplings (6), crab puffs (4), chicken lettuce wraps, super volcano roll, dynamite roll, Las Vegas roll and spicy tuna roll and it cost us $86 for all that. With tip it was $100, even with bad service, I'm not a jerk.",0.0
"I came around 11:40 AM for brunch and ordered the Morning After Breakfast Special with chocolate chip and banana pancakes. While the entire diner was packed, I was disappointed that I did not receive my food until 12:07 PM. With regard to the quality of food, it was good. The eggs (over easy) were cooked exactly to order. The pancakes had a cooked amount of fluff to them and weren't thick and carb-loaded like IHOP. Price of $10 is also fair.",0.0
"This is a one of those sushi restaurants where various sushis travel\/displayed on a conveyor belt counter. The cost is dependant on the color of each plate. The prices are slightly higher than average. There is a picture of the various prices of each colored plate attached. You can call ahead for take out as well. 

The food is good on subtle flavors; avoiding overpowering additional flavors. The food is prepared in a beautiful design with natural flavors for coloring. Attached are some pictures of the beautifully prepared sushis. The udon and miso soups are pretty favorable as well.

Got suckered into an $80 car wash when I initially just went there for a wax. He told me I needed a leather treatment and tire rim treatment and they left so much grease on my rims! Left water spots all over the car and barely did the inside of my car. Go somewhere else!!!!,0.0
"The gluten free ""Garlic"" bread sticks did not have an ounce of garlic in or on them. It was basically just a flat pizza bread crust with a very over-whelming flavor of oregano and basil, the marinara sauce was good tho, but it would have been better if the bread came even hot, it was stone cold bread. 

Now the pizza...same crust as the not so garlic bread, and still that flavor of the bread masked the ingredients of the cheeses and spinach on my Mediterranean pizza. And I don't like a spongy texture for my crust as this one had, and was also burnt underneath. At least It was warm...not hot how i like pizza, but warm.  The only thing good was the honey they give you for dipping your crust in.

Now, the drink selection was limited, we got the very last coke...how do you run out of coke??? No ice, no lemons...and the coke had high fructose corn syrup in it where as my sprite was actually with real sugar...so they should have had at lest some consistency with their drink products...*sigh, not very satisfying at all.

"Bad experience. Our two kids (boy and girl, twins, 11 yrs old) had been asking us to take badminton lessons for several months, so we finally registered for Level 1 badminton classes at Lee's Badminton in Markham. After 2 classes, my son started to express that he did not want to go anymore because it was boring and he did not understand the teachers (strong accent). While my daughter was annoyed that a lot of the attention seemed to be biased toward the Asian children in the group. Indeed I witnesses in several occasions that she was not getting feedback on her technique even if she kept doing the wrong movements over and over, I even had to ask the head of the club to do something about it. She did not complain like my son did. Both kids stayed with the program until the end and went to all classes.On the last day, the kids got the results of a test that they had on the second last week of classes. When my daughter came in the car, she was upset, embarrassed and crying because she got 39 out of 60 (she failed, the passing mark was 40). My son got 40\/60. I was surprised by the results, because I stayed down to watch most classes and both kids were doing better than the average (I used to play competitive badminton in grad school). This was supposed to be an introductory class (so I guess most kids must have failed too). My daughter was devastated and her confidence shattered. My son, even if he passed, told me that before he took the classes, badminton was his favorite sport and now he hates it (how is that possible!!!).What was also strange is that we were asked to registered for Level 2 (???!!!). Both kids have lost their love of badminton and were disgusted by the experience. If that's how Lee's plan to inculcate the love of the game into young children, they should take another look at their practices. Incredibly clueless. Go somewhere else.",0.0
"You know the drill....get to the airport 3 hours before an International flight and there's no line up at the airline counter or security, so you're through very fast and then have over two hours to kill. You don't want to nap as the flight is long and you hope to hell you get to sleep on the plane.
Facing that daunting scenario, we wandered aimlessly looking for a place to eat. Settled on this place.
I've never been to a Caplansky's so I didn't know what to expect. The waitress was over fairly quickly (the place wasn't that busy) and she was fantastic. Friendly, animated, and bubbly. We ordered our food (Montreal Smoked Meat).
Food arrived after about 10-15 minutes, within the time frame one would expect. One of us loved it, me....I was meh (I didn't hate it, but didn't love it). It was, IMO, overpriced, but it's an airport so it's to be expected.

"I had high hopes for this program, but in the end it was disappointing.  I think most of the driving instructors are excellent and their mission of turning out safe drivers is terrific, but the execution was mediocre at best.  We were told at the parent class that they would not just pass a student through the program, but whenever we asked about our daughter repeating a simulation lab or on-road session that she had not ""passed,"" we were always told that she should just keep going.  I would have been happy to pay for her to repeat the things she did not do well in, but I could not persuade schedulers\/receptionists to let her do this.  In the end, she was given a certificate of completion, but she did not feel confident about her driving ability and frankly neither did we.  I tried emailing and calling to set up additional lessons and was willing to pay for those, but after many days of no response and then playing phone tag, we decided to look around and see if we could find someone who really wanted our business.  Today we signed our daughter up for a program at NControl Driving School and will review that program after we have completed it.   If you decide to go with DrivingMBA, I would recommend doing the Busy Parents program so you get more professional on-road instruction and making sure that you ask to ride along for those sessions, so you know how to instruct your child.  You are expected to do 20 hours of driving with your child between each on-road training\/evaluation session.",0.0
"My following experience at earl is one while being highly intoxicated at 230am:

So I found it after asking a few ushers and I ain't talking about the one from Atlanta. It's towards the back of the casino floor and kind of a snake to get to.

Arrived and thankfully no line, I asked the dude taking orders to give me what he recommended, something mind blowing for yelp purposes and he said cannonball without hesitation.

The line to pay is separate, short stocky dude charging, drunk talking got me calling him the real earl, he seemed pissed about it, c'mon dude be a good sport.

They give you the vibrating pager and when it rings you go get it at the counter, the usual.

The cannonball was average, there's not much to describe because it's bread and meatballs, they weren't that great and considering everything I eat is better when I'm drunk that's kind of saying a lot. The bread hits the stomach well though.

"This review is largely for their take away cafe counter.

NOT ALWAYS WORTH THE WAIT
On weekends, there is usually a substantial (15 min) line up just to order food and another 10 minute additional wait for most food.  The line up is indoors which is nice for inclement weather.  They post signs saying food is made to order, so allow 15 minutes for preparation --- but this is only visible once inside by the register.  So, really plan on not eating for another 30 minutes when you get in line on weekend mornings or midday (even when the farmer's market takes place).  

I think it is silly that they do not have a second cash register by now to expedite payment with this problem existing for years.  I don't mind waiting for freshly prepared food, but I do mind waiting in line that long unnecessarily because of poor planning.  Perhaps they could post some of the popular menu items on a chalkboard stand outside or through the glass window to expedite decision making at the register on weekends.  Maybe play music somewhat audibly to make the long wait more enjoyable.  Perhaps try what other I have seen successful restaurants do: Have staff walk down the line to take orders to get food started since payment and menu decisions seem to be the real bottleneck.

FOOD
Somewhat sweet biscuit breakfast sandwiches are great and have improved since opening, with biscuits being larger and more tender now.  The sausage in biscuit sandwiches is okay and obviously formed in house (don't expect Egg McMuffin sausage, it's much thicker, a bit sweeter, less spicy).  Trout biscuit sandwiches are a treat and a good differentiator.  Baked sweets (cookies, brownie\/blondie bars) are hit or miss; I have yet to have any that are truly craveable.  Still, I really appreciate the effort of using real ingredients and making them from scratch.  Owner, Brad Long, is big on buying local, being sustainable; so, you are paying a bit more for that.

DRINK
Espresso (Rufino brand) and cappuccinos are divine.  
They don't sell disposable plastic bottles of water, but rather sell reusable, collapsable (tap-filled?) water bags with sipper spouts that have a caribiner attached. 
They make their own syrups for Italian sodas, which tend be creative flavours. I was extremely disappointed in their hibiscus Italian soda.  Hibiscus is normally tangy and refreshing; when steeped, it makes a rich, red colour.  So, I can't understand why the Italian sodas I ordered barely had a tinge of pink (1\/4 the color of blush\/rose wine); they tasted awful from being horribly diluted.  I'm all about subtle flavours and not having something sickeningly sweet, but these were overly diluted.  I felt ripped off since it cost $9.61 for a large and small drink, plus we waited thirsty in line after a long hike only to be met with disappointment.  The drinks were not very cold and did not have any ice in them, so we had to ask for it and have further delay.    

PARKING
Paid parking in the lot; don't forget your license plate number since it is ticketless parking.   There is often problems paying with credit cards in the parking payment machine, so allow extra time or bring cash.  The machine by the farmer's market seems to work better for credit card than the machine by the restaurant.
Free shuttle busses from select TTC stations, however, I have found them to be infrequent at times.

ACCESSIBILITY
Very easy access for wheelchairs and walkers.  Slightly sloped from parking lot to the door.  Chairs can pull out for wheelchairs.  I do not recall arms on chairs, though.  There are handicapped washroom stalls on ground level (no stairs).",0.0
"I wish we had read the prior review on here before getting our floors done by this company. We have had a very similar experience. Over a course of over two months, our floors have still not been fixed. Now, after a third (!) time out, they look worse than ever! There are actually new stains that weren't on there before! And you can see where the roller didn't evenly apply the top coat in lines (like when you run out of paint in a roller and it shows the roller lines).

Since the beginning of this project, I've shown them pictures, in person examples, post its on the problem areas, emails, and had multiple conversations. I'm not sure how much more I could communicate with these people. The first two times, they covered nothing in my home and the place was covered in two inches of dust. No apologies from their owner when I pointed this out. Last night I called the project manager Gabriel to let him know. He said he'd call me right back and still haven't heard a word.

I could go on and on with examples of their poor customer service. Their receptionist, Caitlin, is the only one there with any fraction of customer service skills. They are unreliable, unresponsive and unprofessional.

"OVERCHARGED FOR EVERYTHING!!

Arrived to Harrah's at 2PM 04\/07\/15 we enter the casino and could not find the check in line, The only line available was for ""Gold Members"" so we get in this very long line with 2 ladies working the check in took about 30 minutes to get to the check in desk. Customer service not nice at all. Yes, we were frustrated at this point.  She then tells us we are going to be charged $30 plus tax for early check in because its 2pm and check in is not until 4pm!

"I'd been to Lisa Marie a few times and enjoyed the eclectic menu, so when a friend suggested checking out their weekly Beers, Burgers, and Bingo event, I was only too happy to tag along.

I won't get into the bingo part, which was fun (if frustrating, since neither my friend nor I managed to win once), so instead I'll just talk about the food. To call it disappointing would be a major understatement.

The selection of burgers held a lot of promise, and after much deliberation, I elected to go with the Kimcheeseburger, which was topped with, among other things, a piece of deep-fried pork belly and some kimchi.

The toppings were fine, if unremarkable. No, the problem was the meat. Lean to the point of desert-like dryness, the patty was overcooked and burnt around the edges. It was very disappointing and almost inedible. My friend's burger arrived the same way, so this wasn't an isolated incident.

I imagine because they were cranking out so many burgers, the kitchen staff certainly weren't able to maintain any kind of quality control. But that's something they should've foreseen, especially considering this is a weekly event.

"My entire Vegas experience was tits. Good tits. But my LINQ experience blew from the get go. We all showed up (it's a double Bachelor Party so we have about 8 or so rooms) and the hotel's system was shut down\/not working so we couldn't check into our rooms. The lady quoted us at ""hopefully only an hour and a half before we can start checking people in."" Hopefully? Only? Not to mention the already rather large line of understandably annoyed people ahead of us. So that throws us off our plans from the start. And when we finally get to our rooms on the second floor, the ENTIRE FLOOR smells like dump...or a really bad lingering fart. We literally checked our rooms to make sure the people before us didn't stash a turd in the pillow cases or nightstand or A\/C vent. Nope, no turd. We call the front desk to give them a heads up and they send some guy up. We ask him to sniff and identify the smell...""poop"" he says before spraying our rooms with some off-brand febreze. All that does is create a new stench. Anyways, the smell never leaves and we never get used to it. Also, the beds were small and not very comfy.

A couple minutes later they took us upstairs to our seats. 

I ordered the wings which were good. Nothing especially fantastic, but good. Like I've had better and I've had worse. While we waited for our tacos they played the new Drake\/Future tape which was cool, I guess? idk.

Our tacos came and they were yummy. Decent fare, I liked it. I found it weird though that they grouped all the tacos together.

"I have now been to Lovecrumbs twice and reserved my judgement after my first visit, as I was extremely disappointed, considering the great reviews it has and the price of the cake - brownies and scones from about £2.50, but most (large) cake slices are about £3.40!! My first cake, which my friend had also, was a Rosemary, Fig & Vanilla cake. It was less rosemary and fig, and more\/practically just vanilla. Hence, it was not the out-of-the-ordinary cake we were expecting and it was even slightly dry to boot.

I returned to give Lovecrumbs another go and was a bit scared to go for something different or something that could potentially be dry again, so closely inspected the cakes before going for a tried and true carrot cake, that contained lots of dried fruit and nuts and of course, yummy cream cheese icing. I was very happy with this cake, although was a bit of a shame I wasn't confident to go with a more unusual flavour. My friend did though, going for Beetroot & Rose cake, which she also chose because it looked moister than some of the others and she thoroughly enjoyed it too. Our accompanying drinks were very nice - peppermint and white hot chocolate, and lemongrass and mint tea (could only taste lemongrass though).

Both times we visited, the café was packed, having to wait for a table on the second occasion and it was rather noisy inside. They have an eclectic mix of furniture and the many cakes are uniquely displayed on tables, shelves and cubby holes.

I am glad I went back to base my judgement on 2 visits, however I don't think Lovecrumbs is a place I would necessarily choose to go again.",0.0
"The service is the only thing that really brings this places ratings down. It's rather abysmal.  My party of 3 walked in around 6:45-7pm on a Saturday to a near empty lounge and no one to greet us or show us to a seat for more than 5 minutes. After seating ourselves, one of my friends went to find someone who worked in the place.  She returned from the back with a less than eager waitress\/hostess who handed us menus and went away for awhile, and for the sake of not over lamenting the fact that service is slow and crappy, I'll just say this was the trend all evening.

On the plus side, the hookahs are nice and pull well. We got one of the ""VIP Selections"" flavors SLM (I believe it was). It was among the best hookahs I've personally ever tried, complete with fresh fruit infused spring water in the base.

"My wife and I had been pleased with the items we recently purchase from the Potato Barn.  Our most recent purchase was for a desk that would fit with our decor.  The desk was purchased, paid for and we requested to leave it at the store for a few days which was granted.

A couple of days later we received a call from the store stating that they had charged us the wrong price for the merchandise and that we would owe an additional $300 plus when we came back to pick it up.  Had we taken the desk the day we paid for it we would not have received the call.

Yesterday we went in to get the desk and question the additional charge.  Their policy is upfront:

NO RETURNS, EXCHANGES, OR REFUNDS. ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

The Best Chicken Sandwich....Okay, little story, we were out last night with a couple of friends who happen to read my posts, the one thing they said is, at times my reviews come across as ""angry""...I can see that, this is one of those dishes....If you are going to name something on your menu 'The Best *******"" then it had better be the best, or at least very good, this was neither, the chicken patty was way to small for the bun, the panko crust was way to thick for the patty and then cooked to much making it hard instead of crunchy.

"Yummy Market is essentially a fusion of a grocery store and a Russian Deli. As such, there is a good selection of delicatessen and cultural specialities (i.e. teas, foods that are a part of the Russian culture). I also happen to like that this grocery store carries organic milk (although it's overpriced), which the Metro that Yummy Market replaced did not (also typical of other grocery stores like the No Frills near by). They recently added a cafe inside the store.

However, there are some aspects of the grocery store that I do not like. Many food items are substantially overpriced. Yes, they have their own baker for the bread, and cook, however, I don't think this is justification enough, i.e. I purchased almond butter a while back for about $8 - 10 more than the price at Sobeys (which isn't even a cheap grocery store), and their organic milk is more expensive than at health stores. You have to know grocery store prices and compare, otherwise you will be paying a lot more. I don't like the fact that day old bread is priced the same as same day bread (I have had them run out of fresh bread on me and had to purchase the day old bread). I also don't like the customer service here. Once I had to purchase mint, and they had a small selection, all of which wasn't very fresh. I would have to throw out at least a quarter of the herb, so I asked for a discount, and they made a huge deal out of it and gave me .50 off (not even half of the price). Being Ukrainian myself (fluent in Russian), I am ashamed of their obnoxious and pretentious attitude sometimes (depends on who you deal with, this generally excludes cashiers, who are mostly young and friendly youngsters and I've found to be nicer and more upbeat than any other grocery I have been to). 

I was there a few days ago waiting for my number to be called at the deli counter, when one of the workers behind the counter sneezed twice into her gloves, and then came up to help a lady beside me. Her name is Svetlana (late 50's, early 60's), watch out. It was evident that she had no intention to change her gloves, so I told her that she needs to change her gloves. She made a confused face, appearing not to understand English, so I repeated myself. She held up a finger like ""hold on a second,"" and proceeded to sneeze once more into her gloves. Then she said to the lady beside me in Russian ""I don't understand what she's talking about."" I then repeated what I said in Russian, and she changed her gloves, without an apology, and without saying a word to me. I really have no words... this is so unacceptable and a public health hazard. I told the deli manager on duty what happened, and she was like ""ok."" She didn't really seem to care.

So after 20 minutes, I actually got up to find her - she was too busy socializing with her colleague behind the bar.

"First off bring a magazine, or maybe a video to watch on your cellphone or even bring a friend along (if they'll come) coz on average you'll probably be waiting in line for half an hour. If you got time and really want cheesecake from here than waiting in line isn't a problem; however, it would be very uncomfortable to wait in the heat of summer plus the heat from the small bakery. 

My next con about the wait line is that, naturally they would like you to wait as close to the shop as possible in order to not obstruct the way for other pedestrians. Unfortunately there is a nice ledge for pigeons to sit on and ""do their thing"". A friend who was waiting with me had is cellphone splatted thanks to our feathery friends (i told him to look on the bright side:it they didn't splat his ice cream lol).

After tasking the cheesecake the first thing that came to my mind was how soft it was. Kind of felt like a spongecake. The next thing was the mild taste present and that I find is pleasanyt, A lot of time when I eat cheesecake the sweetness is overpowering but not in this case.

For me, it is not a ""you have to try this when you are in toronto"" kinda deal. A lot of friends hyped it up but I found it just...normal. Waiting in line for this is like waiting in line for the leviathian in wonderland:  1\/2 hour (or more)in line:2mins to finish (with a group of 3).

"I had breakfast there this morning and now I am laying in my bed at my hotel room sick as a dog.  I made the mistake of of ordering the Chicken Fried Bacon Biscuit.

"A family used to come here quite a lot, but for some reason stopped. Recently came by to check it out, because we heard they'd undergone some renovations. Despite the fact that the restaurant is located in a pretty seedy looking\/deserted strip plaza, I have to say the inside (post-renovations) is looking quite spiffy and actually pretty fancy. They've opened up the main room and maybe installed new lights or something, so overall the place looks a lot bigger, roomier, and brighter. 

We came here for dim sum around 1:30 PM on a Sunday, and only had to wait a little bit to be seated. That was probably the only good thing that happened, because after we put in our order, we just sat there... and waited... and waited. At some point, due to our growing hunger\/hanger, we requested a staff to follow up on our order... only to never hear back from them again. A short while later, we gently inquired with one of the restaurant managers and half-jokingly suggested that maybe our order had gotten lost... to which she scoffed, ""Lost? Not possible!"" Of course, some poor little waitress eventually came by to apologize to us because a) two of the items we'd ordered were sold out and b) of course, they had somehow lost our order. Overall, it was a very unfortunate situation, but in the end we were just thankful to finally get our food.

Food quality was as expected just normal, standard quality dim sum. I did note that overall certain things seemed a bit salty, and I found myself very thirsty afterwards. Overall my family and I were disappointed with our recent experience here, because of the lacking service, mediocre\/salty food, and price point which I didn't think was justified for a place like this in Scarborough. Yes, it looks considerably nicer post-renovation, but the prices are the exact same here as they are at Crown Prince ($2.80 minimum), which I think is still a better looking restaurant and also far exceeds this one in terms of service.

The hotel room had no refrigerator my view is really crappy the floor didn't look so clean half of the decorations in the room where they're scratched or broken I thought it was just my room but upon talking other people the hotel rooms are not much better than mine.

"One late night I was watching an episode of Million Dollar Critic which is a food show hosted by Giles Coren and one of the restaurants he tried was a Pakistani restaurant named King Place. He gave it a thumbs up, so I thought I would try it out. I have passed by the restaurant and never really noticed it because it's probably located in one of the worst neighbourhoods in the city but guess what, the food is authentic and pretty good.

So I decided on the beef nihari ($10.99 plus tax) which is essentially slow cooked beef and one of the national dishes of Pakistan. The combo came with beef nihari, a salad, pop and two butter naan breads. The beef nihari was tender and delicious and the the sauce was rich and vibrant with all the variety of spices used ranging from cardamon, cinnamon and a few others. It was spicy but not too spicy at least for me. The freshly made butter naan bread was delicious. I also ordered a combo of beef nihari with rice ($10.99 plus tax) to go for my close friend who is Pakistani to see what he thought. He gave it the thumbs up and mentioned it was close to what he has had back home.

If you are looking for good authentic Pakistani fare at a reasonable price, definitely give this place a shot. It's not in the best neighbourhood in the city and the restaurant decor is nothing to write home about but the food is pretty good and it's authentic Pakistani cuisine.",0.0
"It amazes me that, after reading the comments here, that this iHop is still open. The location must be the key. Their third and final chance came and went without me getting so much as coffee. I was seated and given a menu, and that is where it ended. FIFTEEN minutes later, I walked out the door, as NO ONE came to the table. The waitress who was supposed to wait on me was talking to someone she knew, having a conversation peppered heavily with 'F' this and 'F' that, and so on. I will not give iHop corporate the time of day on this one, as they have BS'd me twice, in that they said they would handle the situation.

"Cheap spot for decent meal but customer service is horrible.  If it wasn't for a family gathering I would have left after my incident.  I ordered a regular Coke but was given a Diet Coke.  So I asked her if I could change my drink out because it's the wrong one and she said no.  Confused, I go up to the host stand and ask for a manager to get the drink I ordered.  I don't think it was a manager that helped me out because she said if it was something she can take care of rather than a manager.  She comes and talks to the waitress and then comes back to my table and in front of my family, tells me that I need to drink all of it before I can order something else or be charged for another drink.  Out of our huge party maybe three ordered water, so I asked if they can get regular (not diet) Coke and I'll just drink it and she said no.

This review as of now is based on one visit and one plate. You have options between ordering Chinese or Thai dishes and lunch specials are available. I had the pad Woonsen lunch special. The price to portion ratio is exceptional. You get a lot of food for a few dollars. As far as flavor goes I will not be trying that dish anytime soon though I will be back to give another dish a try. For quick cheap eats this is an acceptable stop. Be sure to take advantage of the awesome lunch specials.,0.0

Let me start with the food. I had the bacon and apple grilled cheese with home fries and a Nutella and banana sandwich on my the side and my friend had the classic egg benedict. The food was good and the portions weren't overwhelming as you have at other brunch places. everything tasted really good and came out warm.

Alright now on to the service. We were able to get a table pretty quickly because we were only 2 people. If you are going with 3 or more people except a 20-30 minute way especially on Sunday's. Some of the staff were really young there and inexperienced so they forgot a couple things. Also I tried to order an additional meal off of the children's menu with my main course but they wouldn't let me and made me order it in pieces which was slightly more expensive.

"The food was good, though they were out of the poutine. However, the service was lacking a little. While our waitress was nice enough, she was a bit slow to check up on us; for example, when we wanted more tartar sauce, she was nowhere to be found. She also didn't seem very familiar with the restaurant: what the name Ri Ra means, how to pronounce ""polluck"", etc. At the same time, she gave the impression that she was hurrying us out the door--she asked if we were ready for the check but failed to ask if we wanted dessert (we did). She wasn't the only poor server---after our meal, we went upstairs to check out the whiskey room, but it was practically deserted. We stood around for several minutes and there was no bartender or server to be seen. As if to emphasize the staff's lack of concern, we discovered that the satisfaction survey with our bill had already been filled out by a previous customer!

"Surprisingly enough, when we came here on a Friday early evening, there were still a few tables left for our group of 4. After getting seated, you choose what you'd like from the menu, then go up to the front to order and pay.

It was around $40 for a chicken, 2 skewers, 2 large sides and garlic bread or 2 Portuguese buns.

The food came relatively quickly and we didn't notice this until a few hours after our meal, but our family platter was missing the 2 chicken skewers. For the peri-peri sauce, we chose plain since someone in our table didn't eat spicy foods. The peri-peri vegetables were subpar, with lots of onions in it. The garlic bread was delicious and the potato wedges were seasoned perfectly. The chicken itself was very tender, juicy, and well seasoned.

"Its funny how suddenly there are good reviews for Toni. She does seem great at first but if you have a problem then her true character shines through. Yes people want cute animals, however families with children want animals who are not aggressive or a threat to well behaved children... Yes Toni keeps a clean place for these animals but she does not check for Giardia (a parasite that cannot be found under a microscope) and considering that my puppy had this when I got her, I am sure that most of the other dogs have it as well. This can infect humans although does not happen often. I would be most concerned with small children in the house because they are constantly putting their hands into their mouths. These parasites will leave your pet without proper nourishment which is extremely important in a growing puppy. Toni also does not socialize the puppies well and puppies need to be socialized the most between 6 and 14 weeks. I am sure that the rescue has adopted out plenty of animals and they have been just fine but for her to assume that any animals who are having issues once in their new home is the people who adopted and not the dog is an ignorant assumption.. As for Toni being straight forward and some people considering that rude... That is not the circumstance of our encounter I am straight forward and She was rude...  Everyone beware.... Toni seems upfront in the start but if things don't go right behavior wise with your dog.. You will quickly see through that...  I am not completely against this rescue, however Toni is not what she seems.  I did not expect to end up with a dog that needs extensive behavior training with a certified behaviorist that would cost me a large sum of money that I cannot afford at this time.. Thankfully someone else stepped in to help until I can do more for our beloved dog... STAY AWAY FROM TONI SHE WILL MISLEAD !! THIS RESCUE TAKES BEHAVIOR CASES THAT OTHER RESCUES WONT.. IF YOU HAVE CHILDREN I WOULD GO TO ANOTHER RESCUE SO THAT YOU LESSEN THE CHANCE OF ENDING UP WITH AN AGGRESSIVE DOG!!! Toni refused to.listen to what i was telling her about the dog we adopted and considering that she was in denial about the dog having fear issues and trying to place the blame on us as though we are not a good family..

We both travel a ton and don't usually rent from Hertz because they hire from the bottom of the barrel and customer service is usually week to say the least.

Something that worried me is that my food arrived in less than 5 minutes after ordering. Food has either been made in large batches or is being prepared with the use of a microwave.

I ordered both an order of cheese curds and an order of Shepherd's Pie, an Irish cuisine staple. The cheese curds were heavily breaded and came with something that resembled a tarter sauce. I was greatly disappointed by both the curds and the sauce it was served with. The breading was way too heavy to appreciate the cheese inside. Also why are you serving tarter with the cheese curds? This isn't a fish fry. I recommend putting an Irish spin on the dish. Make a Guinness or a whiskey sauce; do something creative.

The Shepherd's Pie was disappointing. Many of the vegetables in it were diced too large and the pieces were inconsistent. The cooks in the back need to work on their finesse with a knife. I bit into several pieces of carrot that were at least an inch in diameter and completely raw. The ground beef in the pie tasted like it was prepared to be part of a sloppy Joe, not a Shepherd's Pie. The taste of ketchup and bbq sauce was overpowering. Usually Shepherd's Pie will have beer or whiskey incorporated into the sauce. The potatoes on top were prepared well enough. My favorite part of the dish was the crunchy, fried potato slices on top.

I want to like Brocach because I love good Irish food, but I can't give it more than two stars because the Shepherd's pie was so far off the mark for me between the seasoning and raw vegetables.",0.0
"I do not know what is worse, the food or the service. We came in around 7 with a party of 6. We sat for around 30 minutes waitung for menus in an average filled room. After the wait, I asked what i perceived was the bartender if we could get menus to order. After 15 minutes he returned to take our order and then discovered that if he had to do drink and food orders he would have to go get a pen. Another 10 minutes had past until he returned. He finally took our order. I ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and ordered the breadsticks for my son. 45 more minutes passed and we had a table full of empty drinks and at this junction were the few left in the building. When our food finally arrived it was segmented. We were missing a salad, cheesebread and breadsticks. After about 10 minutes into the meal, I flagged down our server and inquired about my son's breadsticks .  He informed me the breadticks were the hardest thing on the menu and took the longest. He then let me know that he was a manager and was not supposed to be even serving. He said 2 employeea called off and he could barely see straight. He said that the owners were in the back cooking. Still without the breadsticks, I request they be removed. My meal was horrible. The buffalo chicken pizza was like a saltine cracker with tuna and tabasco. It was completely bland and had no kick, a fail for $14. The buffalo chicken sandwhlich was the equivalent of deepthroating a salt lick. When we requested the bill be split, the server\bartender\/manager asked if we were joking and we kept asking for too much. I would have preferred to eat a little ceaser's hot ready that has been dropped on the ground. The way that this place is ran is like lord of the flies where the employees are as confused as the customer. I could not reccomend this place to anyone. I took a year off from this place and came back. I guess i will have to wait another year if this place is still in business.",0.0
So I go to  McDonald's  late once in awhile  and this location is  serving garbage after midnight  when I have went during the day it's fine but late at night they shut down all of there ice cream maker  stuff and the food tastes like they were supposed too throw  out. I also think something fishy is going on  there was a police officer in front of me  and he paid with a credit card and I was instructed I was only aloud cash payment   which I had cash  but why do they want cash if they can do credit weird  sh@$.,0.0
"The Skinny: the food is okay not great (2) service: on a dead Saturday night with 3 tables,  service was completely pathetic (1) Mimi's cafe used to provide decent food and service at reasonable prices. How times have changed (1).

We used to come every so often to gorge on fried zucchini sticks which were one of the best things on their menu. However,  major revamping of their menu eliminated our favorite appy so we haven't been back for a while.

We got a coupon for BOGO entrees with drink purchase so we decided to hit the joint on Saturday night.

When we got in the place was completely dead. There were 3 tables not including us and a room filled with booths with dirty dishes everywhere. Not a good sign about the service. 

We were seated at a table with some menus. Our table was bare except for condiments. It took 10 minutes prior to being asked about drink orders. It took another 10 minutes to get our orders in after which our meager bread basket came out. 

I don't recall much about Mimi's but I do remember the nice bread basket with three different choices. Oh how times have changed! Now, there's only a sad doughy ""baguette"" and the ever present carrot bread with very scarce walnuts now (small portion sizes too). 

At this time, our drink orders were still not filled and we still had no utensils. It took another 5-10 minutes to get those and only after asking for them. In addition, our server was largely MIA in terms of checking up on refills of our drinks. This is despite asking multiple times directly for refills and where she either completely ignored us (walked by us) or forgot. 

From then on,  we had a 20 minute wait for the $2.50 side salad and our waitress forgot the side of soup was ordered. My salad was pretty horrible. Limp spring mix on the verge of complete dehydration\/mushiness. The hubs said his soup was okay. 

Our entrees came out about 10 minutes later. We both got a grilled salmon dish ($13.99) -  mine was with fries and the hubs was with roasted potatoes and cream sauce. The salmon was okay. The fries were soggy from the spinach on the plate... Meh. The roasted potatoes were on top of a horrible goopy sauce for the hubs. 

By this time,  we had enough. The slow substandard service when there appeared to be at least 3 wait staff plus a manager hovering around to service 3 tables is unacceptable. (apparently our server was the only one doing the serving... Why?) 

We asked for our check. We had previously told our server that we wanted to use our coupon but she said her manager had to review it first. That did not happen.  So when we finally got our check? No discount was on it. Frustrated,  we had to say it again. Finally the other server appears and looks at out coupon and provides us with the proper total. After that we put our card on the check. From the looks of things she probably forgot to pick it up so I took the initiative and handed it to her at her workstation. I did not feel like I wanted to spend the night sleeping at Mimi's.

We finally got out of there 1 hour and 15 minutes after we arrived. We vowed we were never going to Mimi's again. With the non-existent service and relatively expensive price for the mediocre quality food,  there is absolutely no reason to return given the plethora of restaurants in the area (Cheesecake Factory,  Claim Jumper.... Heck even Feast buffet offers better quality food for the less money on their Prime Rib night). Considering the piss poor job management has done,  I would not be surprised if this restaurant's days are numbered. Sorry Mimi's... You made it into my +1 starred review list.",0.0

"I decided to pay Mother's Dumplings a visit just to see what the hype was all about. My overall take on MD? Meh. It wasn't as amazing as everyone said it was. 

You definitely get that welcoming ambiance from the restaurant - the red walls, the fairy lights and framed pictures definitely made patrons feel ""at home"" at MD. 

Service was really slow. I had to wait for about 10 minutes to get seated and my waiter took ages to come back to check on me after I ordered my food. I will give the restaurant some slack here though - since all the dumplings and baos - from the skin to the filling was homemade, it makes sense that it took a while to get our food. I just wish that the servers themselves were a little more attentive to the patrons - at the very least, they could have let us know how long the food is going to take to arrive at our tables. Overall, in terms of service, the staff were friendly albeit a bit inattentive. 

I ordered the soup dumplings, Northern style wonton soup and vegetarian buns. I was hoping that the food would live up to their prices...not exactly the case here. The food was average at best. I was underwhelmed by the quality of the soup dumplings. The pork filling could have been juicier. The skin could have been thinner. There was barely any soup in the soup dumplings. The Northern style wonton soup was slightly better in comparison to the soup dumplings. The broth wasn't as greasy as most broths that are served in Northern Chinese restaurants, which was a plus. I also enjoyed the gingery flavour of the broth. The vegetarian buns were good but they weren't anything special. 

Overall, some of their food items were better than others. There are definitely better Northern Chinese restaurants out there.",0.0
"Okay so... The older bald guy who escorted me and my BF to our seats was just unpleasant aswell as unhelpful when it came to ordering.

The waiter or whoever he is told me I'm wrong and that chow mein is not noodles!!!! He seemed more concerned about poker or whatever was going on in their ""sketchy"" basement. As for our food, he wouldn't do anything about that. Not to mention the food tasted like stuff you can get at all u can eat buffets like ""fu lam"" !

"Very disappointed! After previously going to salty Senoritas in Scottsdale and loving it. My friend and I came to the Peoria one hungry and thirsty. We were greeted at the door by a friendly manager who sat is right away. HOWEVER, after waiting for a waitress to come over for 20 minutes my friend went and notified we were still waiting. Server finally comes over and says ""I guess I am waiting on you guys"" gives us menus and leaves. 15 minutes then goes by and we are still sitting there waiting. Waitress never comes back as we watch her chatting with her coworkers about 30 feet away not even acknowledging we are there. After 35 minutes no service we decide to leave. Waitress WATCHES us leave and turns her head. As we are leaving the manager sees us and says ""why are we leaving so soon"" in which I stated we were not being served.

"Moved here to a 2 story apt. for a feel of a house for my son after a divorce - needed a place fast. Have never liked it here. 
The water situation is the WORST. When any of the apts touching yours turns on their water you cant hear a thing in your own apt. You have to speak louder, turn up the TV or the music. Its so loud. Also the water temp is BOILING or FREEZING in the shower. You spend the whole shower alternating the dial. One temperature never stays for more than a couplet minutes. There have been so many days that there has been a water\/pipe emergency that they hava had to shut the water off - but the system is so old and decayed, they cant seem to really ever ""fix"" it.

"Went here this evening for dinner with a friend. Restaurant was full for a Friday night as expected. Had to wait 20 min or so for a table because I did not want to sit at the bar. Waitress offered us drinks while we were waiting which was nice. Once we were seated, drunk order was taken and brought quickly. We ordered appetizers, shishito peppers, seaweed salad, edamame, and shrimp tempura. They all tastes perfectly good. Except the shrimp tempura we had to ask for 3 times because it never showed up to our table. Also servers were kind of scattered, we had 3 different ones checking on us. Sushi was average quality for an ayce sushi place and didn't really stand out to me. Orange blossom roll was tasty and my favorite of the night. We then ordered banana tempura ice cream dessert that they had. Another issue was here because the bananas tasted like the shrimp that had been fried in the same oil as the bananas. That was a turn off. I personally have had better ayce sushi in Las Vegas and this place was at best low to mid range on my personal list.",0.0

Food is good but they paid no attention to acoustics whatsoever.   The sound bounces around inside the bar and it is hard to hear yourself think.

"The food we had was quite good. I had the smoked trout, served on some sort of fluffy, whipped cream cheese and rye bread. The portion looked small but was actually filling. The side salad was very fresh - the dressing just right and the roasted heirloom tomatoes were the best part. My friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which is a nice change from typical flavours for pancake.

We were a bit surprised that there was an extra $4 charge for maple syrup (the pancake was $15) - feels like being charged extra for ketchup with an order of fries. She didn't end up getting the maple syrup, but I can't imagine eating pancakes without it if it were me. Overall, the menu was pretty expensive - perhaps best for special occasions.

The ambience is excellent - the decor very in tune with the surrounding Evergreen Brick Works.

The dumplings: the dough was good, but they mixed potatoes and other veggies together, creating a paste without much flavour, like they put everything in the same blender and cooked it thereafter. The pakoras' dough was sweet - not my favourite. The vegetarian cari lacked the freshness of the spices, you couldn't taste the flavours.

Everything is overpriced, but even if it is overpriced, you would think that the quality is good.  Nope.  Tastes Terrible.  Worse, workers are very rude and unfriendly.  One worker kept talking to her coworker while making my drink and guess what.  She messed up on making my drink 5 times.  Even on the fifth time, it still wasn't right.  The worker could have at least apologized but she kept rolling her eyes at me.  I pay $4.50 for a venti passion tea just to have it taste like sugar? I mean how hard is it to make a passion tea sweetened.  You make a drink over sweetened if you don't count how many times you pump the sweetener.  Also, they charge for hot water.

It was a run down hotel that needed renovation.  Paid $130 a night during a tournament.  Rooms are stinky and carpet dirty.  Bath room needed painted and shower head fell off.  I will say the staff is nice and the breakfast buffet was very good.  The hotel has potential just needs a good cleaning and painting and some higher end fixtures and carpet.,0.0
"For me, this isn't the place to go for a mani\/pedi. The first time I had a pedicure here, one of my toenails wasn't painted completely. I shrugged it off; it was just overlooked. I just went back recently to have my toes done as well as a french manicure before a vacation. I did the french manicure because I especially wanted it to last through my trip. On the first day of vacation  (four days later) i was shampooing my hair when i felt a few of the nails peeling up. By the end of the week all of them were peeling off and even my toe polish was chipping. I've never had my nails fall apart like this and I paid quite a bit to have them done so I called when I got back in town and the manager was really sweet and had me come back in to have them done over. I went in yesterday and someone else did my nails. First I have to say that the file they use is really coarse so it leaves my nails pretty ragged at the tips. Next, the cotton fibers from the cotton balls they use stick everywhere so when I got home I realized she had painted in the fibers in several of my nails. Another nail is rippled (which had to be fixed while I was there because the first time she did it, it was rippled). Even after fixing it, it looks pretty bad. It's not really noticeable to others, but it is to me and if I'm going to pay that much to have something done, I want it to be right. The staff there really friendly, but the execution is lacking. I'll unfortunately have to find another salon.

Edited to add: Sure enough, the day after having the gel manicure re-done, the rippled nail started chipping. A few days later another nail started chipping. Then another. I called and spoke with a manager and told her what was going on and that I wasn't thrilled to come back in and have them done another time. She told me that she would be happy to refund my money and told me she would talk to the other managers to make sure they were aware. I went in today but the manager working today had no clue what was going on and didn't seem to care about the poor experience. When I told her what the other manager said she must not have believed me so told me she'd have to go call the other manager to clarify that they would indeed refund my money. She left and came back...was on the phone a couple times (one of which she was talking to the other manager about how much they would refund me, other times she was answering other client calls). I know it's a business and they need to answer their phone, but there were several other employees just walking around the store, but the woman supposedly taking care of me kept answering other calls (meanwhile I'm trying to take care of my 8 mo old who is now getting pretty fussy). Finally I gave up and left. While I've been very impressed by the friendliness of the staff, I do not appreciate how this was handled. I most definitely will not come back, nor will ever recommend this place to others. Not only was it a waste of my money, but of my time as well.",0.0

The water heater broke and flooded my living room damaging an expense rug that couldnt be replaced. My apartment was broken into through my sons window the point of entry. Dog poop in front of my door almost everyday, management did nothing, roaches everywhere, i had to spray myself to prevent them. I had only 2 burners on my stove that worked due to no drip pans.  To fix things they moved me closer to the office upstairs, and raised the rent. 6 months later my place was broken into again and this time they stole all my electronics, the point of entry was through the front door with a crowbar and the door was kicked in.  On top of that the neighbors below me had empty beer cans all over in the parking lot and on the grounds everyday.  I asked to break my lease due to the unsafe environment I have my son and I living with.  Unsanitary, unsafe, no security during the day when the break ins occured, security is only posted during the night shift.  The management company said I would be breaking my lease and your account will go to collections if you dont pay.  I offered to pay the 10days prorated rent I would be staying once i move because i found a new apartment and they refused to accept that..

"BEWARE!!  People at the store were helpful, but they charged my card the minute my order was placed online (on a weekend, when they couldn't be reached by phone), despite my explaining in the comments that I wanted to confirm the color before the order was completed.  They did call to discuss the color, and even sent photos to help me make a decision (especially since shipping to California was VERY expensive).  I got back to them - via e-mail - that I appreciated their help (which I did) but that I was not going to complete the order and, instead, continue to look for a color closer to what I was after.  I said that, if I decided to go with the alternate they suggested (different type of yarn and color), I would get back to them but, for now, I wanted to keep looking.  They responded by saying to let them know, and how nice the other yarn was.  Two weeks later, I get a message that they've shipped yarn to me!  I immediately contacted them, saying I had canceled the order - that I had told them I was going to keep looking and had not accepted their suggestion, but their response was that it'd been two weeks so they automatically shipped.  I'm guessing they've sent the yarn I initially chose online....I have no idea!  They sent me no warning - no confirmation that they were going to ship....and that's when I discovered they'd charged me for the order the minute it was placed - NOT when it was shipped like every other company I've done business with online.  I'm EXTREMELY disappointed and will never do business with them again!  Beware if you give them any credit card info!  They'll use it whether you want them to or not, and the minute they have it....even when nothing has been settled or even shipped yet!!

Tapioca Express is conveniently located by UNLV, and its ample parking, wide selection of food and drinks along with lots of tables to study makes for my ideal study spot.

SERVICE
First off, some girls here got major attitude. I am a huge fan of milk teas and have tried many of the milk teas here. My most favorite (and sadly one and only drink I like from here) is their oolong milk tea. The problem is...they've been out of oolong tea for what feels like an eternity. Probably ever since dinosaurs existed. Too long!

Back in May, I kindly asked one of the girl if they have oolong tea back and she goes ""Ooohhh, we are probably not getting it back for a loooong loooooooong time"" with rude and snarky attitude. It made me want to choke on boba and walk out of here. She could've apologized for the shortage or at least be a little bit more professional.

I have also overheard these servers talking smack about customers. Unprofessionalism at its finest.

DRINKS
As stated above, I only like oolong milk tea here. It is one and only milk teas here that you can actually taste the tea. Their black milk tea is extremely sweet and taste very artificial. Not even a slightest taste of tea. Jasmine milk tea is ok, has a really distinct and weird taste that I am not a fan of. Other milk teas taste artificial as well, like it is made from powder and syrups.

I do enjoy the boba here. Has the perfect texture every visit. I also got to try their mini boba for the very first time. Personally not a fan but a lot of people seems to enjoy it. 

CONCLUSION
Oolong milk tea seems to be the only thing worth coming to this place but they've been out for a while...I can't speak for other drinks such as slushes or flavored teas since I have yet to try them but I am not sure if I want to deal with the servers here.",0.0

My friend and I had gone to McFadden's as Yard House was swamped, and we were looking for something similar.  The inside is a dive. There's no authentic Irish pub feel here.  

We were unfortunately seated in the bar area which was insanely loud. There was Guinness on tap, but the rest was domestic. If it's an ""Irish pub,"" I would expect to see a few more things on tap from Ireland...just saying. I ended up ordering a Sam Adams seasonal.

We ordered two orders of the poutine on the happy hour menu. About 20 minutes, the food arrived. It wasn't the greatest, but it wasn't the worse. I would describe it as a cross between McDonalds fries with some cheese on top of them. Branding as an Irish pub should generally come with good pub-style food.

"A favorite place to stay at...especially during the off-season. This recent visit, however, was not so wonderful. 

Let's start, however, by saluting the staff, who were 5-star, all the way...they couldn't do enough to help -- in any way asked and at all hours of the day\/night. 

The facilities, however, left much to be desired. To begin with, it would've been nice if The Boulders had mentioned that the pool (near the casitas) was closed for repairs\/renovation. Despite the fact that the resort provides round-the-clock shuttle service anywhere on the property, the idea in booking a desert hotel room (in the summer) is only worth doing if two things are in order -- your room's AC and the nearby pool. Another problem was the resort's poor WiFi connectivity. After a couple of days of trying to log on to the Internet for work and family purposes, we lodged a complaint or two with the manager(s)...this resulted in being moved to another casita -- which had great connectivity, but was adjacent to a very loud bit of construction. Finally, having the water shut-off in the middle of the day may have been necessary for the construction work, but it was still a major inconvenience. 

The end result of all this was a ""discount"" off the check-out invoice of...approximately\/just $7 a day (consider that the DAILY resort fee is $25...on top of the room rate). 

The Bolders is a fantastic resort with an amazing staff...but it would've been nice to have been warned -- pre-booking -- that inconvenience and noisy annoyances would be the hallmarks of this stay, rather than (the expected) relaxation and enjoyment of the facilities.",0.0
Bartender has serious anger management issues. Absolutely appalling management. First the bartender started yelling his head off at our friend who simply pointed out that they had his card and that we were being served at the tables just by the bar. Then the manager came along and absolutely failed at managing. Didn't get the bartender to apologize and instead called in the bouncer and threatened to call the cops in on the entire party for imaginary reasons. Clearly they were all having a bad day after dealing with an army of ASU students but that still is no excuse for such appalling behavior. Will never go back there again. You would be wise to avoid them on a game night as they clearly cannot handle the stresses of handling a lot of people at once.,0.0
"I have been to Cast Iron waffles several times and every time the food does not disappoint! The waffles themselves are slightly smaller than a typical Belgian but the dough\/batter mix used creates a heavenly consistency and taste. The toppings are delicious! The bacon waffles, however, use some sort of bacon bits instead of the fresh crispy bacon that I would prefer. If I were grading this solely on the food, I would give it 5 stars even though it is a bit pricey (around $4 for one deluxe waffle).

"This was once the best Burrito place I had ever been to.......

The food was always fresh, quality control was job#1 until today.......

My group ordered 3 burritos (pretty simple eh?) one was specifically stated to have absolutely no hot sauce or peppers whatsoever.

Well 1 burrito was done well with an exception I will follow up with at the end.

The other 2x were completely screwed up and my colleague received the blazing hot sauce 2x lines of it and spicy salsa......

For those that may not know how bad this was...... his condition is no different than someone with peanut allergies that can die if they so much as ingest a single gram of it......

When a patron is accustomed to a vendors work they manifest a form of ""Trust"" that the vendor will never screw up 3\/4 of the order........

My burrito was bland with no flavor at all..... pulled pork with no spice or hot sauce is well...... tasteless.
My colleague however is being rushed to the hospital.........

The 1st burrito eventually made my colleague sick as well........
I did not eat mine because it was screwed up and bland.

We called immediately to advise them of the horrendous error and wow........
""I am sorry"", was the excuse and further ""we are pretty busy here today"" oh wait there is more ""well if you ever decide to come back there is a free burrito in it for you......""
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME???????

By the way, that was the manager speaking, he needs to be fired along with the moron that screwed up the order along with the person that quality controls these before going out for human consumption.

Another colleague of mine had the fish Burrito.... he was violently ill for the entire evening as the edges of the fish filet within were dry and the center was undercooked and wet...... more complaints grew from more of my colleges that I wont bother putting down now......

"I returned for my 5th time, I think, and had a nice salad and a protein shake.  Food and shakes have always been tasty and healthy here.  We sat outside, which was great, except for the dog who was with another customer.  The dog was on a leash but not a short one and they allowed the dog to sniff around, wondering freely and toward our table.  I mentioned this to cashier when we went back in for the shake, and was taken a back when they rudely, in my opinion, said, ""that is not our problem.""  Perhaps they were correct, but it would have been better to tell me something more comforting or reassuring.  Did not like the attitude.  I will probably remain inside next time.",0.0
"This is really such a nice library.  The place is HUGE and kept clean.  I love the quiet study room they have, and they have two additional private rooms (must be reserved) if you are meeting with a group of people for a group project or something.  Here are my issues:

The librarians are not friendly at all.  I have had many encounters where they are just flat out rude and talk to me like they hate their lives and I am bothering them, making them hate it even more.  I don't get it.
Their food and drink policy: I get not allowing someone to come in with a cup of pop from  fast food restaurant\/gas station, or not allowing someone to smash a big mac as they are on a computer in the computer lab. But when I have a bottle of water and a bag of skittles and I am in a cubicle with my own laptop...come one now.  I'm not 12. I was asked to ""get rid"" of my food and drink, so I said ok and put it in my purse.  The librarian hesitated like she wanted to tell me no I had to throw it away, but then she knew there was no way she could force me to do that. She walked out of the room and I continued to eat my skittles.

There is typically a police officer hanging around there too---which can be very convenient when you're in the study room and teenagers come in and try to put on music to write tracks (or something?) and they're talking like they're hanging out in Starbucks.

I told him you watched my 3 year old and I the whole time at least you could of smiled and said hello, as you did with your other customers. Basically he didnt care for my color. I will always kill such ignorance with kindness. I just wanted to make him aware of how uncomfortable he made me feel.  I didnt even eat the food.

"I will not return to any Autobell because of my experience with this location. I haven't lived in NC very long and recently decided to try Autobell. I paid for the $15.99 service - considerably more expensive than just your typical drive-through car wash because my service level was supposed to be higher. I understand most of the workers are young kids (which is why I have given generous tips during my first few visits); however, this car wash is too expensive for less than full-service. When I got back in my car there were still muddy paw prints on my center console and the side of my passenger seat. These are things that one swipe with a damp towel could take care of! Clearly, I was not getting my money's worth. 

In addition, my back seat was still full of dog hair - not even an improvement! It looked as though they decided to not even touch it. The floors mats were spotless, but the seats untouched. Before I handed the kid my tip, I asked if they swept the backseat because there was still a large amount of dog hair. He responded, ""yeah, I'm sure they tried at the beginning of the wash but we can't really get dog hair, sorry.""

"It saddens me to have to write a negative review for a company we had such high hopes for, however, that good experience and feelings we had about I Do Events changed weeks before our wedding. The review we gave Echo is not what we actually experienced, it was based off promises and wishful thinking. That weight we initially had lifted off our shoulders crashed down on us weeks before our wedding. We are truly unsatisfied with the service we received from I Do Events. From the beginning we communicated our needs and the services but felt as though we were more of a bother, that we were asking for more and more and felt guilty for the needing the services we had agreed upon in our first meetings. We were not listened to, the same questions were asked repeatedly about multiple things that had been discussed in prior meetings, over text, email and on the phone. Our wedding should have been so easy for a day of coordination. I planned it, I booked everything, I followed up with my vendors (thankfully because days before multiple vendors had not been coordinated with, like our florist), I even put an entire outline, complete with photos, descriptions and the location of where each item was to be placed. Our biggest issues were with the lack of communication on Marisa's part. My wife and I fully understand that life, injuries and other unimaginable circumstance can and do happen, however, we feel that the way things were handled were not professional. It is truly unfortunate that the one vendor who was supposed to make our planning process and day of less stressful is the only one who caused worry and stress leading up to our wedding day. Injuries aside, we do not understand why, as a wedding planner, changes were not communicated prior to being made. It is horrible that we found out from our food vendor that a new point of contact was given whom we'd never met or even heard of. The changes made without our knowledge made us uneasy about our situation, unsure of what would be taken care of and who would actually show to take care of it. Additionally, the reasons we were given as to why you were unable coordinate our wedding seem more like phony excuses as days after our ceremony, which you handed off, you were coordinating other weddings and attending multiple events. To this day, my wife and I have not received even the simplest form of communication to make sure the people she set-up worked out or not.",0.0
"While I've heard great things about Siam Cafe, I unfortunately did not have the experience I was hopeful of.  The food was subpar at best as I had ordered the General Tso's chicken which is advertised as spicy; however, it was far from it.  When I saw that there were chili peppers on top of the chicken I was expecting much more of a kick than I had received. As someone who can barely handle heat I was a bit confused as to the lack of spice.

Aside from that, the curry rice was delicious along with the broccoli that was served with my meal.

"Horrible Customer Service!  I really like the actual hotel and the pool.  However, this place is very unclean, dirty dishes, nasty floors and horrible management.  I was there the other night and my toddler's shoes came off while sitting at booth waiting for our dinner to arrive.  Next thing you know she lifts up her foot and she has blood running down everywhere so I panic.  The entire security staff comes over takes pictures have me fill out  a form all  while I'm trying to keep my crying toddler calm.  I mean, really?  

To make a long story short, I observed as they were taking pictures that the booth was full of glass and other nasty items that should have been cleaned prior to sitting us there.  So we ended up moving to another table, the whole incident was a huge inconvenience and you'd think that management would have done something to make up for the horrible experience that we encountered during our first visit to their restaurant.

I honestly never complain unless it's warranted, but this was flat out piss poor customer service.  When something goes wrong with your customer especially something like this, you make it right.  Comp the meal, offer free meal tickets so that your customers don 't want walk away unhappy.  Make it right!!! especially when you know you're in the wrong.  Your customers first impression can be a lasting impression.  If you have an opportunity to make it right, do so and then all is well.  

Again, it was my first  time visiting the resort and I actually liked the hotel, but this restaurant was horrible and management clearly doesn't know anything about customer service.

"Every now and then, you just need a donut.  There are some delicious donuts here in the Phoenix area (Lamar's, Bosa) and I was excited to see a new shop opening up on Bell Rd.  I drive down Bell Rd to work every morning and for the last few weeks, I had seen a sign out front that said ""Coming Soon"".  Well, I drove by it the other day and it was changed to ""Grand Opening"".  I decided to stop in and sample their goods.  I parked, walked in and here is how everything went down...........

I got in the place and there were 2 people working, a man..who seemed to be the donut maker, and a lady who was working the front ringing people up.  There was a lady already at the register who had placed her order for some donuts and was waiting on a coffee or something.  They have one of those coffee machines that you find at cheap gas stations...the kind where you put your cup underneath it and then press a button and it comes dripping out.  Well...that wasn't working so well.  Something was wrong with the coffee maker and the guy employee\/owner was taking it to the back to get it fixed?  Anyways...the lady finally was rung up , grabbed her donuts and was on her way.  

While all this was going on, it gave me some time to browse their selection.  They had pretty basic offerings and I had a general idea of what I was going to get.  There was one other guy in line in front of me.  It was his turn to order.  This is where it went a little hectic (I was running a bit late to begin with and I figured I would just pop in, grab some donuts and be out in a few minutes....that did not happen and here is why.)  The guy in front of me starts asking the people if they can ""fill a chocolate long john"".  I instantly made my ""you have to be fucking kidding me face"" and shook my head.  Hey...I'm all about freedom of choice.  We live in America, damn it!  But if there is a line of people behind you, just choose from what they have in the case.  This isn't ""Donut Throwdown"" and the last time I checked, ""create your own donut day"" falls on February 30th!  Get outta here..........  Anyways...the nice people that own the place granted his request and went and got the jelly donut filling machine, popped his long johns in there and gave it a squirt.  He replied with, ""I always liked those as a kid.""  I felt like replying with, ""Where the fuck did you get your donuts from as a kid?  I've never in my life seen a jelly filled chocolate long john.  Anyways......he was on his way.

It was finally time to get my donuts.  I went with a regular glazed, a raspberry filled jelly donut, a  double chocolate cake donut and a chocolate covered buttermilk bar.  A tad under $4.00 later, I was out the door.  Here is how the donuts were..........

Regular Glazed-  Very light and airy.  When you bit down, it was like a soft pillow collapsing.  The donut had good texture and a good amount of glaze.  It was probably my favorite of the bunch and I would definitely get it again.

Raspberry Jelly Donut-  Once again, this was a very light and airy donut.  The jelly filling was just alright.  It was not sweet enough and the jelly part didn't have the best texture.  Decent but not a standout donut.

Double Chocolate Cake-  This donut was pretty small.  The overwhelming theme of all the donuts I tried was that they were not too sweet.  The chocolate icing was pretty thin and the donut itself was soft.  I like a little crunch\/texture when I bite into a cake donut.  Sadly, this one did not have either.  I would not get this one again.

Chocolate Covered Buttermilk Bar-  Why do buttermilk bars always have the thickest icing?  My buddy said it perfect... ""It's like buttermilk bars coating is ice creams Magic Shell of the donut world"".  I couldn't have said it better myself. This donut didn't have the great ""tang"" of a good buttermilk bar.  It was pretty small too.  Probably wouldn't get it again.

Overall, this place is ok.  The lady working the counter was nice and friendly, the donuts wont break the bank, but there are better donuts out there.  This might be a good donut for Surprise (compared to Dunkin or store brands), but it's not in the same ballpark as others I mentioned before.  I will probably be back at some point.  It's on the way to work and its conveniently located so I'm sure Ill stop back in. I also like to support mom and pop type stores when possible.  Stick to the glazed and you will be alright.",0.0
"This is a nice place to shop, eat, and relax with the kiddos, with a different vibe than the newer Downtown Summerlin.  There's a respectable selection of shops, giving anyone who visits a wide variety of stores and eateries.

Lots to see and do here for adults and kids:  clothing shops, appliances\/electronics\/tech, a movie theater, an arcade, a nice assortment of restaurants (some larger and smaller chains, and some fairly unique), and a coffee shop (Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf) that's entirely too small for the volume of people who are often trying to buy coffee there.  Note, there isn't another coffee shop in the entire complex, so if you're looking for coffee outside of a restaurant, you'll have to hold off until you're done shopping.  

Town Square is nearby the airport and south of the Strip, so t's easy to get to and not a bad place to watch airplanes briefly as they're on short final.

One criticism:  In a city where parking is generally free and you have to pay for the Internet, I was surprised when Town Square went to metered parking on the streets.  Garages and the large lots are still free, but curbside parking comes with a price.  I wonder if the addition of meters is just grabbing for more money, or if it's a small indicator of some financial issues that are requiring a little more revenue.  Either way I'll take the garage and large lot parking every time.

If you're on the south side of town, or if you have easy access to the Las Vegas Blvd and 215 area, be sure to check Town Square out.  It'll probably be worth your time to stop.",0.0
"Came here for lunch. Beautiful space and patio. Right in my neighborhood. I really want to like this place. But it's just a little bit of a meh to me. The menu is extensive but traditional (not innovative) which is fine. And they do their traditional things well. I got the lamb chops and house slalad from the lunch menu while my bf ordered from the summerlicious menu. He's happy with the veal he got but he's in general happy with any cooked meat. He was really happy with the tiramisu. I liked how the lamb chop was cooked too, tender and nicely seasoned. But it comes with string beans and a big piece of carrot. I don't know, what's next, some mashed patato and gravy? Just not my type of thing. The waitor was nice, though. If you are into old school this could be a 4 star but not for me.",0.0

The food is good, the price is great. I have ordered delivery from here twice and it always gets here really quickly.

I ordered the Mac N Cheese Dawg and the Bacon Dawg.. I have to say I was a little let down on the mac n cheese dawg. its really really salty tasting. The hot dog itself is great, but the salty taste in the mac n cheese bites is over powering, the jalapenos were crisp and nice not to spicy so that was a bonus. Over all I wouldnt really order it again personally. The bacon dawg is good, the grilled onions are not over powering, although they dont pay attention to the ""special instructions"" as I requested it with none. Still overall great and I actually liked it just as it is. 

My other half ordered the Texas Bar-B-Que sandwhich, he said it was really really great. He RAVED about it. He also got the BLT which let him down (and myself as I tried a bite) it had okay flavor but the bacon had no flavor at all.. none. The tomatoes were nice and crisp though so thats good. The bread was buttered and toasted I think because it reminded me faintly of the bread on grilled cheese. Over all it was a tad of a disappointment as there wasnt alot of flavor, we couldnt taste any bit of bacon even though there was a decent amount on there. 

But the fries are freaking AMAZING. Like they are my new love addiction. I love the fact that for $3ish dollars more I can get a combo with fries and a soda and the soda is a fountain drink, not a can. 

The delivery driver is quiet, actually more than quiet I believe both times I barely got out ""thank you"" before he was walking away... I dont even think he said ""Here you go!""  he just handed me food... it would of been awkward if he wasnt gone the moment my hands grip the bag XD.

"I started going to the Parlor only because I followed my former stylist Cole here from the Centennial Aveda Salon.  And even though the prices were higher and they do not offer a military discount like Aveda, I continued to go out of loyalty.  However, the last time Cole cut my hair I was not pleased.  He wanted to try some new technique he learned with a blade.  I trusted him, so I let him.  When I got home my hair was very uneven and I have to do a lot of touch up trimming myself.  I was unsure if I was going to go back.

"Went to Flower Child for the 3rd time for lunch around 11:45am.  Long line waiting all the way outside the restaurant in today's 106 degree heat.   Line moved very slowly and there was not enough shade to cover every one.  My girl friend went inside to tell the manager to serve cold water for guests waiting in line as we spotted a young pregnant woman standing in the sun.  Finally, a young girl carried a tray of water and lemonnade passing it around.  There was no table inside the eatery availalbe, so we cannot order food at the counter and were told to sit aside until there is table for us.  Another 10 minutes wait until the hostess gave us a table number.  At this point, we had already been waiting for 40 minutes!!!  I had the Flying Avocado which was tasty.  My girl friends had Madras Curry and Chopped Salad with chicken.  They liked their meals, but we all felt the portion was small.  Curry has only few slices of chicken, no rice.  We were satisfied, but not full.  

The menu was simple, but it is obviously for people that are vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free,  The portion is definitely small because my teenage son went there and had to order two dishes and a desert.  It gets very expensive!   As for me,  I am too poor to have any digestive issues, so this place, although health conscious, is not where I'd come back again any time soon.

"I'm writing to share an unpleasant experience with ACE store in Cornelius, NC. Having recently relocated to the area I immediately sought out independent businesses to do my shopping. In my experience I like to support local and generally find that I receive a higher level of customer service even though I may pay a little more than the big box stores. I purchased a fountain\/water feature and they agreed to deliver it to my home. I was unaware at the time that delivery ended at my driveway! They informed me that company policy prohibited them from moving it any closer to the home. Important to note that my patio, where the fountain was going, was only 10' from where they dropped it. Yes 10' yet they refused to move it any further. When I went back to the store the manager assured me that he would have his moving guys call me the next day and come back out to move it the additional 10'. Not only did I not get a call from the movers but received a call from an ACE employee informing me that they would not move it any further and if I wanted to have it moved they could give me the name of a company that moves fountains!! This is truly a poor reflection on the ACE brand when a store manager blatantly lies to a customer about his intentions.

"This place was okay. The pho was average is pretty good in flavor. My boyfriend and I both ordered the three things we normally get when trying a new Vietnamese restaurant. Pho tai bo vien (pho with rare steak and meat balls), cha gio (eggrolls), and goi cuon (springs rolls). The pho had good flavor, I would go back for that, however the eggrolls where not that great. The nuoc mam had a good flavor for dipping, but the filling in eggrolls was not typical and in fact strange. Instead of the black mushrooms, it had a strange and weird tasting white long mushroom. The meat filling would have been good if the mushrooms were taken out. AS for the springs rolls, they were average as well. They had wayyyyy too much rice noodles in it and the peanut sauce tasted like straight peanut butter.

"So I ate here a few nights ago while visiting Vegas and was not disappointed, but I was upset with a few things. I will start by saying that the petite filet was delicious, and it was perfectly done. I paired it with the cheaper Sterling Merlot. I also had a side of sweet potato casserole, since I can never pass up anything with sweet potatoes. 

Here is where I was disappointed:

First, the service was OK. Don't get me wrong, our server and her ""helper"" or assistant, whatever you choose to call it, were very friendly and attentive. However, they were improper. I also work at a high end restaraunt where service is very important. Language at the table can make all the difference in the world. For example, rather than attending to individuals there was yelling across the table and the whole ""what can I get for ya?"" type of service. 

Second, the presentation was absolutely terrible. They serve their steak on a plate by itself bc their plates are 500 degrees when they come out. So your side will actually be on the side, which is fine, but none of it had any type of garnish, and you could tell the rims had not been wiped down after the food was plated.

These may not be that big of a deal to many people but it should be noted, because when you are paying for a high end restaraunt you should be receiving top quality in all areas of the restaraunt, not just the food. I say this because part of the price you pay should reflect your experience in this type of place rather than only the food. 

I don't mean to be rude, I am sure being in the Vegas location the turnover is much higher and they probably don't have time to be as attentive as they might be somewhere else. But if you are like me and and believe these are important factors in your dining experience, then keep walking. I am sure there are other high end Vegas restaraunts where you can receive the whole package for that price at Ruth's Chris.",0.0

The won ton appetizer is very tasty and usually  not too oily.

Be warned that different chefs\/cooks seem to have different ideas of what ""mild"" means.  Some will not spice it at all, while sometimes it will have a touch too little or just enough heat.  My solution is to ask for the spice tray.  I use the red chili powder mix in particular, but only add a little at a time or you'll add not heat than you want.  Blame it on being from Hawaii, but I also enjoy ordering a side of white rice and using that to supplement the noodles in the soup.

"I went here in the summer with my cousin who was visiting Toronto and really wanted to come here. With the line up being half an hour, I wouldn't have waited had it not been on her tourist wishlist. We waited and we're excited to see all of the flavours of ice cream and cookies. We planned to share so we got a Taro macaron sandwich with Taro ice cream (yup we're Asian and love our purple yams) and we got a cookie sandwich with cinnamon crunch ice cream. They looked glorious, esp the macaron sandwich. We left the crowded storefront and found a bench on Ossington. After a few cheesy photos, we dug in. After a few bites in silence, we slowly put out our verdict...hmmm...it's sweet...this is kinda messy to eat...hmm the ice cream is just ok, until we both realized we were on the same page --we really didn't like it, either of our choices. It was just humbling to admit that we hated something that we waited half an hour for, and was 'proud' to get after ordering, like we earned it or something. But no --the ice cream did not have that pure taste that homemade ice cream should, it didn't taste fresh, but rather gummy, it was overly sweet, and was just bad. The cookies also were not good. They were not hard cookies, but they weren't soft either. Nothing chewy or gooey or fresh-baked comfort vibes here. To bite into the sandwich, you have to bite hard enough that it forces the ice cream filling to slip and squeeze out. Pls understand, that my cousin and I love to eat, we love sweets, and especially love enjoying them together. But we were so turned off by how bad this was that we were offering the other to go ahead and finish it, meaning, we didn't even want to eat it and finish this ourselves. With immigrant parents, we of course, finished it, but only on principle, not because we wanted to. I will definitely not be back with so many other ice cream and cookie options that are much more superior around.",0.0

"The service we got was TERRIBLE!!!.  We ordered our meal and drinks then 15 mins later had to ask for our drinks, then when they brought our meal it was all wrong. They brought 1 kids meal to the table when we had order 3. They brought 1 sandwich at a time over a 20 min period. Most of which were wrong and had to be sent back. 2 of my kids were screaming because 1 kid had lunch and the others did not, which added to my frustration. My sandwich was the last to arrive and when it did it was wrong and without the soup I had ordered. I asked for another round of drinks while we waited for our right sandwiches, we watched the server pour them and then walk away to the back of store and our drinks sat on the counter for another 10 mins until we again had to ask for them. Then after returning home we realized we had been charged 2x for our lunch. We placed 2 calls to the restaurant to fix the chargers and we told the manager wasn't in until the next day and WE would have to call AGAIN tomorrow after 4pm. Over all incredibly disappointed! I wish the restaurant the best but I WILL NOT be returning! And I have yet to be reimbursed for the 45$ extra charge :(",0.0

"I had never before heard of this casual Italian restaurant, but my husband's grandma recommended that we all eat dinner here. We showed up on a Sunday evening. The restaurant was packed with customers. We had to wait several minutes for a booth near the bar. The bar was not our preference because it was noisy, but at least we got a place to sit. I liked the taste of my house salad, the table bread with olive oil, my broiled cod with broccoli, and my husband's chicken parmesan (yes, I ate some of his food!). The waitress brought out the food without long waits. The price was not expensive. The problem that we had was that the waitress gave only one out of four people a drink refill, so three people had drunk all of their first drink and were very thirsty. I was sucking furiously on my straw to drink the melted ice cube water. Because of the lack of drink refills, my husband left a small tip. Overall: decent food for the price.",0.0

"Went to this chipotle on a Saturday around 3pm took 17 min to reach the front of the line. I have been to this location in the past and have experienced faster service, however, this visit was very frustrating. There were obviously some issues going on this afternoon they seemed short staffed and having major pos cash register issues but the feeling I got from the staff was very unpleasant. The few people who were working had dead stares on their faces without an ounce of urgency that they have a line wrapping around to the front of the door. A manager of some sort came out from the back and was about to roll a trash can outside but when he saw the line he took the trash can to the back and proceeded to help out. I thought this would make the service faster but it didn't. He simply washed his hands and stirred some food around filled up one container with something and that's about it. He should have pushed the line through or noticed there were issues at the cash register as well. 

After we get our food and are almost done eating 3:40pm I see 6 employees walk through the front door about to start their shift and one just roaming around on his break, go figure. 

Lastly, while in line I was about to order chips and guacamole with my burrito bowl. Looked at the guacamole and was disgusted it was literally brown and looked like it had been sitting their since they opened or possibly from the night before.

"It's... not bad here. Honestly the food is pretty good, not the best Mexican food but certainly not the worst. Their chimichanga dish in particular is great, but they stopped serving it with beans for whatever reason. Any other Mexican restaurant you go to will serve it with rice and beans, but that's just a small complaint. Really what they lost stars on is service. It's certainly quick, but almost too much so... to the point where it actually feels like they're pushing you out the door. I had met with a college friend for dinner here once, intending to catch up, we had finished our meals, paid the tab, left a generous tip (which the server picked up while we were still seated, which having been a waitress myself seems a bit of a faux pas unless your shift is ending or the restaurant is about to close for the night) but we were still finishing our alcoholic beverages. He then came back to the table, asked if we wanted anything else, then after we said we were fine, said ""Okay, because other people are waiting to be seated."" We hadn't even been there an hour. Having been a waitress, I understand most of your income will come from tips, but we ripped generously and regardless, you don't speak to a table like that. If I wanted to eat and leave in 10 minutes I would have gone out for fast food. On a separate occasion I paid in cash, expecting change, and watched as my server walked out the door for the end of his shift, never to return... basically taking a 50% tip. To be fair, I have complained to the company about their service and they do get back to you\/ sometimes offer a gift card or something but if they send me one anymore I just give them away. I have no intention to return here when there are other Mexican restaurants with better food and friendlier service.",0.0

"As a local I was disapointed with this restaurant.  Since I am not yet 21, the hostess told us we could not sit at the tables that were by their bar, which is a reasonable rule for most restaurants; however these tables were no where near the bar. They were closer to the public walking around than they were to the bar.  So they put us at a table in a dark corner (that was next to another bar I might add). So I can't be next to their bar, but it's okay if I'm sitting right next to another one.  
The service and the food was subpar. The waitress had a difficult time understanding us so we had to repeat ourselves a lot.

It seemed like there was an entirely new crew because the vibe was just significantly less professional and upbeat. We walked in to a brunette behind the counter with a guy in uniform, both of them cursing in frustration over something. Whatever.

The only upside...we didn't have to wait at all this time. We paid, walked around the corner for all of one minute before our beeper was buzzing at us. Because we didn't have to wait you'd think that it would have been even better than my first time (we waited around 15 minutes the first time I was there), but it was pretty much all down hill from there if the overall ambiance upon entrance didn't already kill it for me.

These guys brought girls up on stage and rubbed and grind  on them and yes guided their hands into their pants. The dancers also came out into the audience often and did lap dances. It is a really small venue so pretty much every seat is great. Before you walk into the theater make sure to buy some Aussie cash to get guys to come to you and lap dance.

"Breakfast of Champions!  OK, more like breakfast of maybe semi-pros.  When was the last time you saw Michael Jordan at a Denny's?  That's right, never.  Although doesn't Shaq or Magic Johnson own a few of them?  Can't remember.

I like this Denny's location much better than the one closest to my home.  This one is bigger and the décor is a bit more inviting.  Service seems quicker & more hospitable.  Plus this Denny's turns over people at an alarming rate, especially on a weekend morning.  Long wait lines disappear pretty quick!

Not that I eat breakfast at Denny's all that often.  And really, Denny's for the most part is synonymous with breakfast.  I look at the lunch & dinner menu and I just shake my head.  Why oh why does it seem like it caters to older (much older) people?  Not saying it's bad, but just seems so old-fashioned!  So, I just stick with the breakfast stuff.  

I like cheap, and when I want an OK breakfast for chump change & am sick of $1 breakfast sausage burritos from McDonald's, I end up at Denny's.  Yeah, you go to their regular breakfast menu and some of that stuff costs you a few fingers!  More than $12 for some of their damn omelets!  $10 for a friggin' breakfast sandwich!  Unbelievable!  So I go with the little, all the way in the back of the book, value menu.  Get items priced at $2, $4, $6, and $8!  More my style!  Save the rest of that money for some Lipitor prescription later.

I often opt for the $4 Everyday Value Slam - its got 2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (I go with sunny side up), and either 2 bacon strips or 2 sausage links (I usually ask for 1 bacon strip & 1 sausage link).  All you need for a growing middle-aged man!  

But this particular morning I was feeling extra manly and won a gangbusters of cash the night before at the casino...went home with $20 profit WOOT WOOT!  Changed that sucker for all $1's homey!  I felt like ballin' so I went with the BIG bad boy - the $8 Grand Slam Slugger!  2 buttermilk pancakes, 2 eggs cooked to order (over easy this time), 2 bacon strips AND 2 sausage links yo!  With a side of well-done hash browns, baby!  Plus it includes an endless cup of coffee AND a small cup of juice...orange for me, boi!  Breakfast just got BIG PIMPIN'!

Felt like a million bucks eating this thing!  Pancakes were light & fluffy not to mention drenched in butter & warm syrup, dippin' my bacon into the runny egg yolk & ketchup just like I like to do, even the damn coffee was pipin' hot & fresh like Beyoncé's backside (yeah I got 99 problems but hash browns ain't one).  Don't forget the Cholula!  But whoa, had to knock it down a star because of the cholesterol overload!  Halfway through I was boggin' down, this Grand Slam Slugger ain't no joke!  Watch out, it'll put you down for the count!  Just too rich!  I felt like I needed some kind of vegetation on my plate to counter all of the oily goodness.  Even a piece of parsley would have been good to gnaw on.  Ended up taking a to-go box with about 1\/4 of the Slugger left.  Be forewarned - cold, rubbery pancakes make bad, BAD leftovers.

Great bargain for all the food & drink you get!  The $8 Grand Slam Slugger from Denny's will be my go to breakfast meal from now on, except I'll probably end up sharing it with the wifey.  Yeah, 2 for 1!  Save that money!  For Lipitor & a crossfit membership!  No joke.

"Not a lot to add to what others said about pricing or food, it is in an airport after all.

We had a short layover at the airport and Caplansky's was next to our gate. The smell of it as we walked by was enough to get our attention and get us in the door. There is a seating area and a takeaway\/ordering area, but I think both sections are still self serve. You order your sandwich and pay, then are given a number which is called out when your order is ready. We chose to split a turkey sandwich, the meat on these babies is generous and splitting it was probably the smart way to go to avoid subsequent meatmares on the last leg of our journey. After ordering, the waiting area for orders is a bit chaotic and there seemed to be some confusion to customers as to where to find their order numbers on their receipts or some not even having their receipt anymore. Pro tip: keep your receipt until you have your food.

"I have been going to Peoria Eye Care for a couple of years.  I love and trust the doctor.  Trust is very important for me in an eye doctor since my family has multiple different eye problems.  My issue is with the staff.  During my most recent appointment was the final straw and I have since decided not to return.  While pulling in the parking lot for my appointment my cell phone rang.  I stopped and started digging in my purse to find it.  It was Peoria Eye Care asking me if I needed to reschedule my appointment.  I looked at my clock and it was 9:31am.  One minute past the scheduled appointment time.  Seriously?  I told the girl I was pulling in the parking lot.  After parking and walking into the office, I showed the receptionist my phone showing 9:32am and said, ""I am 2 minutes late. I would have been here sooner, but I had to stop and dig my phone out of my purse."" All I received was a curt ""I guess not everyone's time is the same."" from her then she asked for my paperwork - and made me sit and wait for 5 minutes while she walked in the back.  No apology.  The doctor visit went fine and I was given a new prescription.  I started browsing the selection of frames at the store and after a bit of help from one of the other girls, I did find a nice set.  The girl was explaining my insurance benefits and what I would be able to order when another woman (the one who did my initial exam - not the receptionist or the doctor) came over and asked if I was paying cash or credit.  When I asked why it mattered, she told me that they were waiting to do an upgrade to their credit card machine and if I wanted to pay by credit I would have to hurry it up.  REALLY?  I'm the customer.  I would have to hurry?  After thinking about the treatment on the way in and then the rush to get me out of the place I told the girl helping me with my insurance that I was feeling very uncomfortable and unwelcome and that I just wanted to pay for my exam, get my prescription and leave.  She got up to charge my card for the services, and must have told the receptionist what I said, because the receptionist came over and tried to apologize.  The problem was she didn't really apologize. She tried justifying her actions by saying it was office policy.  It was not sincere.  I paid my bill and left.  I will not be returning.  I would hope that those women would learn a lesson in customer service by my actions, but I highly doubt it.",0.0
"Had dinner recently here on a quiet weeknight.  Service was very good.  The food was just so-so.  I had a house special calzone which included tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach and mozzarella cheese.  The idea was appealing but the execution not so much.  I found it squishy-mushy with cheese oozing out and doughy inside.  Finally deconstructed and just ate some of the veggies from inside.  My companion fared better with a simple pepperoni pizza.  Small size was still plenty to take home.

I noticed several lunch specials which might be worth returning to try.  I don't think I'd come back for dinner.  Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I've had calzones in other places that were really, really good.   

One additional note, we sat at an ample sized booth.  When I sat down on the bench, I sank way low on it.  The worn out bench had several very low areas where it seemed I could be swallowed up.

Went in there for lunch today and left very displeased! i asked the waiter what was the top seller for pasta as i was really hungry and usually pasta comes in a large amount. He said the ravioli for sure and i asked for a glass of wine 5 oz to go with it. The Pasta came out and it was smaller then an app plate and i was not please that there was barely any food on my plate.. Even more not pleased when i got my bill it was 20.50 for the pasta and 16 dollars for the wine.. This was lunch not dinner !!! and i left and had to grab a burger after! I wont ever go back there.. Its not even the price but the lack of food you get for that price and its not a high end place.. i dont think lunch should cost 50 dollars in the eaton center for a pizza and pasta place !

This property claims it's been updated. I'd love to know where the money went. On arrival was met by horrible smell of smoke. Smoking allowed in lobby area and casino. Awful. Room was dated.

The banana chocolate chip pancakes were so dense and there was really nothing special about the syrup that came with it. For the less than average taste and presentation, the price doesn't match. 

The peanut butter shake\/smoothie was more so ice than anything. Lacked a lot of flavor and just wasn't anything of a wow factor. Add more peanut butter or milk or just redo the entire recipe. 

Thankfully the muffin was complimentary from checking in because that wasn't worth paying for either. C'mon at least do something right. They said it was baked fresh and coming straight from the oven. As I received the muffin it was room temperature.

"There are quite a few varying reviews on this property.  I was here for a 5 day class, so I did not want to spend a ton of money on a room that I would not be in for 99% of my stay.  I needed something inexpensive, close to the strip, clean, with Free WiFi.  This property fit the bill.

Again, I acknowledge the many poor reviews, but decided for the price, this met all my requirements.

The first day did not start so well, its a 2 story property with no elevator, so I hauled my bags to the room across the property.  The front desk person keyed my room incorrectly.  So I had to trudge down to the front desk and get a new key.

I finally get into my room and it is clean, but there is a musty smell.  I search around and someone(housekeeping) left a wet towel behind the door.  This of course tells me mopping sweeping of the bathroom, is not so consistent.

Moving on through the week, everything is pretty good.  Room is clean, towels are exchanged.

Last night was a disaster.  I come home after a long day, and beds are not made, towels still on the floor.  I call down to the front desk ask what happened to housekeeping.  They tell me, ""Sorry nothing they can do Housekeeping has gone for the day"".  Since it was my last day, I say fine just take a portion off my bill.  Thirty minutes later (18:00), when housekeeping was supposed already gone, shows up with their cart.  I am tired and hungry and getting ready to shower, so I tell them do not worry about it.

Upon heading out to dinner, I stop by the desk to take care of some administrative work, and also remind them to give me a credit for my housekeeping not coming in.  The front desk person says, they got the note and will investigate in the morning.  I tell them there is nothing to investigate my room was not done, and would like a resolution before I check out early the next morning.  They then turn to another supervisor who says they can send a houseman up to clean my room.  I tell them no, I am on my way out for dinner.  THey then tell me since I am ""refusing"" service there will be no credits.  I tell them fine come clean my room, it is now 18:40 how long?  The response was, ""there are 2 requests ahead of you so you will have to wait"", I press again how long since i was tired and hungry.  The response, ""there are 2 requests ahead of you, and I wont discuss this further with you"".

I had no hope of eating all this food, but it gave me a good cross section of the menu.  For the meats - 1.  Brisquit - nice smoke flavor, good texture, but too dry for my taste.  2. Spareribs - nice smoke flavor, good texture, needs no sauce to be enjoyed - my favorite of the 4.  3.  Beef rib - beautiful bark, good texture, flavor was good, but needed sauce to be enjoyed.  4.  Last and certainly least was the chicken.  It was all dark, so I had high hopes, but I found it over cooked, dry (for a thigh) and pretty flavorless.  I can't recommend the chicken at all.  3 Sides - 1.  Kicken beans - not bad, but I am spoiled by Jack Stack beans in Kansas City - none other has so far come close.  2.  Bacon potato salad - just ok, a bit bland for me.  3.  Side salad with Chipotle dressing - my favorite side.  I would give this place 3.5 stars when compared to the other bbq I have had.",0.0
"So... Here's the deal.  I waited a long time to eat here.  A long time.  It always sounded great but the parking lot was always full - too full - and I'm a bit of a claustrophobe.  However, last fine Saturday night on our way to see the Cirque show we drove by and the parking lot had a few spots. 

First impression:  Super cute!  Reminded me of The Roosevelt.  Beautiful patio (full) and candles and the whole ""old house"" feel inside.  We were told to seat ourselves.  At least 3 waitstaff passed us with no acknowledgment.  Our waiter came with menus and took our drink order at the same time.  Fine...  But, bummer, sodas come in cans (no refills) and I am prego so beer and wine are off the table (ha).   

We were stoked to order and the chips and salsa were slow to come but super yummy.  We were excited to get our ""mains.""  He had the mac n cheese which, he says, tasted good but he could tell it had been re-heated.  To me it tasted like the inside of a refrigerator and reheated.  

My salad would have been AMAZING (great portion size, good flavor) but it was totally WARM.  Like, limp lettuce warm.  And it had waaaay too much dressing which only added to the limpness.  

The waiter didn't seem to take the ""we are ready to go"" cue very well and by this time we were pushing it to be on time for our show.

"I am a huge fried chicken fan, so when I saw this restaurant I was very excited to try it. The mainstays of their menu are chicken tenders and chicken sandwiches. I opted for the ""blue Ribbon"" sandwich, their mainstay sandwich, a side of fries, and a soda (free refills). The total came out to about $16.

The sandwich was good. I didn't think the chicken dry or greasy, enjoyed the seasoning on the breading, and enjoyed the fresh (and cool) lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles against the warmer chicken. Several different sauces are offered, all sweet. I tried them all, none of them wowed me. The fries are shoestring, not my favorite. The soda was...soda. Overall, I enjoyed the food and the service was above average. Being new, the restaurant itself was spotless. What really brought this place down were the prices. I guess I can understand the rents are pretty high at Downtown Summerlin, but close to $16 for a smallish chicken sandwich, shoestring fries and a soda is a lot!

Although there are a few higher priced eateries in Downtown Summerlin than Blue Ribbon, there are a lot of less expensive\/better value choices too. On a plus note, all the packaging was biodegradable and able to be recycled!",0.0
"I recently just visited the Local on 5th for my lunch break today. I orded the California strip wrap that consisted of bacon, turkey, and GUACAMOLE. When the server brought out our food, I noticed it looked a little dry and something was missing.  That something was the guacamole.  This was already annoying due to the fact that my fries were cold, the wrap only consisted of 2 out of the 3 ingredients, and my lunch break was starting to dwindle down.  I politely informed the server of the missing item and she proceeds to tell me "" oh yea they just ran out of guacamole"".  First off, why wasnt I informed by the server prior to my food being brought to the table, and secondly why would the kitchen prepare something half way with out consulting with the server who should have asked the guest?? Slightly confused by it all, and frankly dissapointed because I fell like the establishment has potiental.  The server did offer me something else to replace my original menu item after hearing this was a problem.  She then gives us are checks and lets me know mine will be dicounted. The discount was $1.50 off my $11.00 meal -____-.  I know things happen but if the service was better and communicated to the guest better I promise it would not have been an issue.

"Today after a lengthy discussion with this Petsmart  manager Gauge, I have decided to go forward and write about my grooming \/ nail trim experience.  To begin, I have frequented Petsmart for many years, utilizing the grooming, daycare, purchases in the store and their vet service through Banfield.  Up until a month ago I raved about how wonderful this store was.  About a month ago, this store had management changes.  This is just the beginning of a horrific event.  I have two dogs who frequent this store a few times a week.  Some employees at the store have said that ""my girls"" are the unofficial store mascots.  I have also received many compliments about how well behaved and calm they are.  One dog is 10 and the other 12 1\/2 years old.  They are both in excellent health, with the exception of the older having arthritis in her lower back.  I have had their nails trimmed on a monthly basis and up until last month, I have never had an issue.  I always inform the groomer that the older dog needs extra support under tummy when trimming her hind nails, and the groomer has always done an excellent job.  I had no complaints until last month.  On this day, I brought both girls in early on a Sunday morning.  A groomer named ""Kayla"" took my older dog back to dremel her nails.  I walked through the store with my other dog and I was approximately in the middle of the store when I heard my older dog yelping many times as if she were in pain.  I immediately returned and asked to see my dog.  Kayla returned my dog to me and stated that my dog was ""nasty, mean and out of control"".  My dog was barely able to stand  Her entire hind quarters were shaking.  I immediately walked over to the cash register, showed the employee who was there her condition and asked to see a manager.  The employee at the register stated he had also heard her yelping, and wondered what had been done to her.  This employee knows my dog very well, and was surprised to hear the words this groomer used to describe my dog's behavior.  The assistant manager took down my information, apologized and then stated that I would be hearing from the store manager.  Two days passed, and then I contacted the store and left a message for him to call.  No response.  After two more days I then contacted corporate office.  A few days later, I was then contacted by the grooming salon manager.  I met with her and she basically said this is an excellent groomer and apologized.  I finally did hear from the store manager two weeks after the event  In the meantime, right after the event, I took my dog to be seen by a vet.  She was diagnosed with a sprained hip and was placed on pain medication  I am happy to say that after 4 weeks and many vet visit (over $200 in vet bills) my dog has begun to recover.  I am very lucky to have had this outcome.  What I learned from this experience is that groomers are not licensed or regulated in the state of Arizona.  I have also learned that Petsmart does not value their customers, nor do they care about the safety of their pets.  I also learned after speaking with the vet staff at Banfield, they have treated many dogs that have been injured by this grooming facility.  Because of this experience, I will be moving all of my business to a  local vet, not a huge corporation, and I will be utilizing a small pet store by my home to make further purchases.",0.0

"Umm... Okay so I guess I missed the bandwagon on this place because after leaving here tonight I'm a little confused as to what's the big hooplah about this place? Listen I'm all for given credit where it's due however this place just doesn't get my vote. My co workers love it and I have had their food and now tonight a chance for the happy hour! This review is strictly for the happy hour and nothing else. For starters lets talk about the joke of a menu they have for happy hour? You might as well not even offer happy hour with the half ass menu they are offering? Like cmon now it seriously only benefits people who like beer and cheap wines that will leave you with a headache? Oh and the little bit of food they have listed is a joke as well. I ordered those extremely fried chicken wings that were .50 cents a piece.. And yeah full of grease when you bite into them and extra freaking crispy, no thanks. The drinks are priced I guess we'll for beers but what about the folks that want a good cocktail on the happy hour menu! NONE of the regular cocktails are priced differently during this time frame and that sucks a lot being that most places at least list the well drinks. The service is cool but just put it like this they won't ever get another dime from me and I'm sure they are okay with it because seems from the other reviews this place is a hit! The entrees I've tried before in the past were ""just okay"" as well. The whole garlic noodle thing throws me all the way off. If the happy hour improved and they listed more relevant items I may or may not try them again but for now they are most definitely on my skip list!",0.0

Nice brunch. The setting and bottomless mimosas are what make this place popular for brunch. The menu is not that diverse or unique from any other brunch. The thick cut bacon is tasty and good which is to be expected since they pride themselves on the butchery on the first floor. However I feel as if the menu is expected and therefore not that special and lacking in flavor.  I enjoyed the views from the balcony where we dined but I'm not in a hurry to return.,0.0
"Service is fine, I don't have any issue with that. In fact, some of them are really nice! However, the food is far from its price. Previously when they were newly opened, the prices were rather reasonable and I would be able to expect a decent meal. However, with the new menu changes, the prices have increased drastically for the same meal prior to the change. Food is okay, some of the stuff has a lot of MSG. The new menu also makes it impossible for you to spend less than $5, as you will pay a minimum of at least $5 for any cup of drink. I think service is rather decently paced, although sometimes it can get a little slow. I waited about half an hour a couple times for a drink that I had to switch to To-Go because I would not have made it in time for class.

The space itself is fine...only a few blind spots, nice intimate venue. They bring decent acts in, although they have a lot of repeats and need to bring in more new acts. But the two item minimum just infuriates me. Overpriced, shitty food and drinks. We went to see Lachlan Patterson last night (hilarious show, very nice guy, signed our CD and posed for photos with people). We dropped $40 on a chicken quesadilla, 6 hot wings, and 2 Yuengling drafts. The whole time I just sit there thinking about all the amazing places I COULD have eaten for $40. Burgatory is right down the street. Hell, TGI Friday's would have been better.

All they have done in the last 2 years in my opinion is find more ways to add things that take your money and add less value to the pass. They have added lots of stands selling bottled drinks, but they can't refill your free cups, which negates the point of having the free cups, if I'm spending extra money to get the cup I should be able to fill my cup more often and much more conveniently!

"I wish we had looked at the Yelp reviews earlier but with no phone on us we just walked in, baited by the $16.99 AYCE price. 

My boyfriend wanted to celebrate a win by taking me to AYCE and we decided to finally cross off Mariko on our AYCE hit-list. For $16.99 all-you-can-eat, we didn't have any high expectations of the food quality. We just wanted to be full and be merry.

Food was average-below average but enough to satisfy. Tempura was never crispy (and if you think that's an undercooked yam tempura, no, it's just carrot.) The salmon sashimi was probably the only highlight of our night, though they were poorly deboned.

But oh, did we wait... I think we came in at 9:30PM and our first order didn't come in until 10:20ish. There were only three other tables. It was like this with all our orders until closing time. I guess on the bright side, we finally paced ourselves at AYCE and there were a set of flies that entertained us as we tried to keep them off of our chopsticks.

Service though? Really bad. Like, I don't think I've ever been this baffled by service in my life especially since my entire family (also Chinese) works in the restaurant scene. To start off, we were handed two sheets for AYCE but no pen\/pencil. No plates for anything until we asked for them during our second order. Water has no ice and was lukewarm. I would not be surprised if it was like those restaurant stories my parents tell of places that rinse utensils in drinking water. Ha..

Communicating with the staff is terrible. They're always in a rush (to not serve the other customers) and were really condescending. I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt especially if English is not they're first language when it comes to tone (since I understand this issue having interacted with so many ESL Chinese) but no... the staff is just plain grumpy 24\/7. 

We were charged an extra ~$4 due to some miscommunication and after waiting for our waitress's 20 minute phone call to end, we flagged her down. We disputed this charge but instead of rectifying this issue (sounds familiar to some other yelp reviews?!) they asked why we even bothered coming here instead of the other AYCEs on Bloor. W-what? We were willing to pay the extra charge since it was a misunderstanding on both ends and it was only $4 but the immediate lashing out that occurred from wanting to get the situation clarified was downright unnecessary. They eventually removed the charge and we even *tipped* them (something I will regret to this day.) I was even more put off by how fiercely the waitress grabbed the money off of the table sans the tray by slamming her palm down on the bills and then clenching them in a fist while I was in the middle of exiting the booth..

Ok just had to get that off my chest because a big pet peeve of mine is house drinks that suck, but when they are actually GOOD, my day is made!  Came here for a weekday dinner and chat with a friend.  Typical cute Mexican ambience going, friendly staff(for the most part) and the chips were fresh... Be warned the salsa is spicy... But I like spice so it worked for me.  I wasn't super hungry so at first I was going to order a taco salad which wasn't too big but then i say they had BEEF TONGUE tacos and of course I had to go there (I immediately was transported back to Mexico in 2003 that time I took a road trip from Cabo to La Paz and stopped at a few,what some might call, sketchy places for a quick bite and each place had their versions of tacos with all the little nasty unrecognizable bits of the animal but taste absolutely AMAZING)
So yes, I went for the beef tongue!  I was a little disappointed that you are not allowed to mix and match tacos or order single tacos... I like options, but whatever. The tacos were ok... Not exactly as life changing as I remember but tasty.  The salsa served with the tacos however was something special... It had fresh ground chilies and everything!  The pinto bean purée that also came with the dish was also tasty.  I sampled my friend's carnitas and it was delicious and I now understand why she doesn't order anything else.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Our server was a little odd but he also seemed pretty young.... He seemed to want to rush us out toward the end of the meal but I will chalk that up to a one off.. I'll be back",0.0
"My daughter has been coming here for almost 2 years and although it is a good school it has its deficiencies. One of those being that the management team is not very organized and there is not a whole lot of communication between parents and teachers. On second thought maybe there is some type of communication but it just seems like the parents are always the last to know. 

Also, my wife likes the fact that public schools have a library but of course the charter schools do not. Although we take our daughter to the public library instead I'm just saying that it would be nice for my daughter to be able to go to check out books herself at the school library. I guess it's just something we have to live with cause we don't want her going to the public schools around here. Just too much overcrowding and it will get worse before it gets better.",0.0

The Chili cheese fries at Planet Hollywood was   awesome.  It was just loaded with tomato,  cheese,chili, sour cream and onions. The chili cheese hot dog was a difficult task just trying to keep it together while eating it.  It was good but nothing special! Not really  worth the $8.50? It's on the Strip so I'm not going to complain on the price.

So yeah, we spent about $16 on a hot dogs, chilli cheese fries and a drink .  Sounds expensive, but now at least I got to experience what  Pink's has to offer, just wish I knew what all the excitement was about  Maybe next time I'll give their Veggie burger a try.  Looks really yummy!

"My latest visit to the LensCrafters at West Towne Mall was a couple days ago when I asked them if they could order me a replacement temple for glasses I bought there a year and a half ago. They said they can't do that but I could try to do it myself online. I did try but had some trouble so I went to Pearl Vision and asked them to order it for me. Pearl Vision in Fitchburg was more than happy to order it for me, even though they don't even sell that brand. So why couldn't LensCrafters do that?


Ugh. I hate this LensCrafters. I do shop at LensCrafters because they have such a huge selection. But I can't stand this one in the west towne mall. Several times I've bought glasses at a small boutique shop here in Madison because I would rather support a small business than LensCrafters but I keep coming back to LensCrafters because of their selection. So over the course of 20 years I've spent well over $10,000 at LensCrafters but I will no longer go to the West Towne Mall location. I will probably go to a Twin Cities LensCrafters who, in the past, have been very professional.",0.0
"Do not buy from here!!!! I bought a 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 back in July of 2013. The salesman was not at all knowledgeable to anything on lot what so ever. I got all of my information and detail from my step dad, who is a dodge salesman back in Michigan. The paperwork took almost 3 hours to complete. And during that time they were supposed to get the truck into the garage to check it out as it had just been pulled off the truck. When the paperwork was done, the truck wasn't ready. Was told to come back the next day and it would be ready when I got there. Came in the next day at noon to get it, and had to wait over 3 hours for the truck because it wasn't done. After I left with the truck, 2 hours later, the finance department calls and says I filled out the paperwork wrong and have to come back to redo everything. After I spent 3 hours sitting at the dealership that day. 

Never had too much issue with the service department however. Minus the wait times. 

Fast forward to May of 2015, I traded in the truck for a new car. I went in 3 times to get my refunds on the warranty and gap insurance that they ripped me off on. They give me the run around. And finally after 2 months, someone tells about paperwork I had to fill out that no one told me about previously. So I fill out the paperwork submit it. I was told I'd have the warranty refund back in a week which took 4 weeks. And they would rush my gap insurance refund which I still have not gotten and it has been over 5 weeks. Which is at least $2000 refund they are probably trying to keep. Now no one will return my calls.",0.0

"I am now filing suit against this horrible company for so many reasons listed in my below reveiw. Having a Truck with Dangerouse Alignment Issues, Worn Wipers, Broken Fridge, Generator Broke after 2 Days, No Heat, No Electricity, only 1 working charge port off truck battery, and ants infested in truck! In the contract and during this trip I was told I would be reimbursed for ""down time and expenses, inclduing hotels etc"". They breached this contract, they never gave credit to me for this, and to make matters worse they had the nerve to charge me for 9 days (In my opinion the entire 9 days was ""down time""), due to all of the issues. If they were to follow their own contract and promises from Road Side Assistance (their only customer service, when your on the road!). I informed them on DAY 5 after being stranded all day trouble shooting with them in a parking lot in Utah with No A\/C Sweating to death, that I was done and going to Denver.  I told them I would get the truck to them ASAP, however, due to my health condition that is STRESS INDUCED I was not going to do any driving and my friend would be. So it took us 3 days to get it to them from Utah because we stayed in a hotels, stuck in traffic, stuck in a tornado storm, and had to find a Hotel in Colorado to spend hours unloading the truck (You can read this whole story in my review).  You would think if they gave a crap about thier reputation and customers, they would honor their ""down time reiumbursment"", and to top it off they charged GAS, and they charged me to clean the truck! Are you kidding me?????  I was stuck in HELL with this vehicle and told Road Side Assistance that I would NOT be wasting one more moment for cleaning vehicle, gas, and when I got to Denver I got there, and was not going to rush for them!

"Ambience 5 stars- this place doesn't feel like Pittsburgh, food 3-4 stars, service marginal 1-2. With all the buzz, I had reasonably high expectations. I booked a reservation for 12:30 brunch today (Sunday). Throughout the meal, our waiter primarily ignored his tables and chatted with what I assume to be management throughout our meal. At one point, another patron actually got up to ask him for something because he had been so neglectful of his tables. I could see the waiter stand from my seat and watched him spend most of the time chatting. I typically tip 20 to 25% and he certainly did not receive that type of compensation for his blatant laziness. 

The food was quite good. There are a wide variety of brunch and lunch options. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals. However, the timing of our food took exceptionally long for brunch and was debatably worth the wait. No apology from our waiter or assurance that our food was on the way. He wasn't paying any attention anyways.

The ambience goes without saying. The drink menu looked to be interesting and creative but the attitude of the staff (I won't get into the blah reception we received from the hostess - not even a hello?!?) will ensure that I don't break my neck to get back here.",0.0
"I've been using megabus to travel between montreal and toronto for the past 2 months. I've made 5 trips back and forth. Ticket price has ranged from $22 to $80. I give megabus 2 stars for three reasons. Number one, it's never reached the destination on time. It's been 25min to 3 hours late!!! Albeit it took 3 hours extra to reach toronto once because of construction on 401. However I am displeased that even with no traffic and no problems on the road (when I take 6am or arriving at 3am buses), we have never managed to reach on time. I'm lucky if I reach my destination 25min late. The average delay is 45min. I traveled in August and September, so weather was not a reason for the delays. 

Second reason for 2 stars, their washrooms are terrible. Clean to begin with but very uncomfortable for females. Very cramped and disgusting. I just avoid drinking water or anything before and during my megabus ride, and try my best to avoid the washroom for the 7 hours or so it takes. 

3rd reason is that the WiFi is weak and not reliable.

"We visited Roland's on Sunday for an early dinner and drinks. The hostess at the front felt her conversation about another customer was more important than greeting and seating us. It took about 5 minutes for her to even acknowledge out presence. After we were finally seated, it then took another 10 minutes for a server to take our drink order, in fact, we were just about to leave when he made his way over. I didn't think it could get any worse....but it did. He brought us waters first then our beers, little did we know these were the only drinks we would get. The restaurant's doors were open and the day was hot and humid, perfect for enjoying a lobster roll and cold beer. Our waiter brought our food, we ordered a second round and he was never seen again. I witnessed more apologies to customers that day than I ever have. It wasn't even crowded. Having my own experience in the food service industry, I realize how hard this job can be but this was unacceptable.

Shots are cheap during late nights. 

Beers are pretty cheap all year around. I usually get a blue moon and that's about $5 for a 16oz. Or $5 for a giant miller lite during football games.

Food is decent. Nothing horribad. Nothing astonishingly great. They have a happy hour menu and a football happy hour menu. 

What I do love is that it's not crowded as heck during football games and finding a seat is not like finding a needle in a haystack. My boyfriend and I were there this past Sunday for the afternoon game and it was really easy to find a table with a TV right in front of us. Speaking of TVs, they have plenty. They have different games on different TVs so it's not a team specific bar. However, I do believe Niner Nation is here. They rent out a certain area of the bar and that's where they usually are for the Niner games. It's all good -- I'm all in for the Niners as well. 

The only downside to it is that the service is super slow. There is usually only 1-2 waitresses for the whole sitting area. They take a while to get your orders down but the food is generally really quick to come out...probably because the food isn't brought to you by the waitress.

"The customer service we have received from this company so far is bad. We originally had our first appointment scheduled on 6\/15 between 9am-3pm. I was told by Toni\/Tony (it's a female) on 6\/12 that we would need to be out of the apartment during this time frame and the job would get done. My family needed to schedule and plan ahead of time because we have pets who cannot be exposed to the pest spray.

We came home at about 3:15pm on 6\/15 thinking the service was over. There was no note and no sign that anyone had been there. I called them at 3:30pm and asked if the exterminator had been there yet. I was told by a male this time answering the phone that the exterminator had been busy but he was on his way right now. I confirmed we were leaving. We were not told to wait or leave the door unlocked.

We stopped by the apartment at 6:50pm to check the note on the door to see when the time frame was so we could prepare to come back. Instead, there was a note saying the spray guy came at 5:30pm and could not get in, he didn't have a key and no one was home to let him in. Also written was call later to reschedule. We had wasted a whole day coming back and forth from Phoenix, wasting gas and time, as well as money because we couldn't be in our house to cook.

So 6\/16 about 10:40am there's some guy at the door saying he's with Wagner and he was here to spray. We tell him that we can't do it because we can't take our pets anywhere, we had to plan ahead for this. He said that was fine and said call Wagner to reschedule. We tried that but was told to call our apartment office to have them reschedule.

So today 6\/22 I wake up at 8:15am so I can confirm we are on the list of places that will be sprayed. I called at 8:32am and was told by Toni\/Tony that she can't tell me that I needed to call my manager. She was pretty rude and yeah, it's early in the morning, but you don't need to sound like YOUR CUSTOMERS are bothersome. I didn't even tell her what apartment complex I was in or my name so she must act this way with other customers.

I check in late on Monday afternoon (4\/13\/2015). The reason I decided to stay here was, the Cosmopolitan is a Marriott affiliated hotel, and I have a little status with Marriott Rewards. So I was expecting a good experience. But sadly that was not the case.

"Visited here on a weekday night with a friend from out of town. Having eaten at Basil for lunch often, I thought it would be worth a stop. We split an order of egg rolls (comes with 2). They were piping hot and crispy. No complaints there. For my entree, I ordered the red curry with shrimp. The shrimp were too fishy and didn't taste fresh at all. The curry was good, but nothing above average. Service was great.

The salad was decent but for a bit pickier family members the dinner salad wasn't good for them bc of the amount of white lettuce.

The room, while a little smaller than usual, was neatly appointed and had a great A\/C system. The shower had outstanding water pressure and a good variety of bathroom amenities. The casino had a nice trendy look and feel, but was never very busy which may explain the amazing price for the hotel. My biggest bone to pick is the location at the very far north end of the strip...it's just not the part of the strip that I frequent that much.

"If you are looking for good BBQ, look elsewhere. If you are looking for reheated meats and microwaved sides, keep reading. Obviously this place is a chain, but I didn't know this until I did some further research after eating here. This is a fast casual type of place, where you order and pay at the counter, then self serve drinks and condiments are around the corner. They have daily specials at $9.99 each. The special of the day (Friday) was pulled pork, 2 sides and a roll. I went with this deal, and also added a drink so my total was around $12. As soon as you tell the guys behind the counter what you want, they start preparing your food. The counter is super duper high, so you can't see what is going on while the food is being made. This bugs me a little bit, but it's not a deal breaker.

While my food was being prepared, I made my way around the corner to get my drink. Fountain sodas and sweet\/unsweet tea was on tap. I chose the sweet tea and it tasted pretty un-sweetened to me. You could tell there was sugar in it, but if I am drinking sweet tea I want it to be SWEET. They give you a large souvenir cup that you can take home with you and reuse which is cool. Next to the drinks they have some vats of house made bbq sauces. Spicy, original and sweet, I got a cup of each.

I got back to work, and when I opened up the box of food excited to dig in, I was underwhelmed. Inside lay a pile of un-sauced pulled pork, 2 raw white onion slices and a few dill pickle chips. A white roll accompanied my 2 side dishes of jalapeno beans and mac and cheese. Let me just say that the beans tasted like Bush's from the can, and the mac and cheese tasted like Stouffers. The meat was not seasoned at all, there was no smoky flavor and I had to douse it in bbq sauce. I thought all the sauces tasted very similar. All in all, I can't see myself coming back here.",0.0
"Chester's Harley Davidson in Mesa Arizona is sure making a name for itself among all my biker friends.

The customer service is non existant and the service flat out sucks! might as well be thugs running the joint, as this is the attitude I receive from them on every occassion, other than the initial sale. I have a 2013 Dyna Wide Glide FXDWG that is leaking oil and pitching a Vin Error; started after my 10,000 mile service with them. When I took it in for warranty service, I was told the oil leak was fixed and no Vinerror existed after they kept the bike for over a week and didnt even bother to call me when the bike was supposedly finished. When I called for a report they told me'oh yeah its done' 'can we set up a time to deliver it?' so, I get the bike the next day only to find it still leaking oil and pitching the vinerror. When I called and spoke to the service manager ,John Yardley, and was told ""no way!"" I checked it myself and that it was not leaking oil and they never got the Vinerror while it was there, even though the tac was rolled over to the mileage odometer, like it does everyday when I start it and receive the said error.. So I drove that B right on in and pointed out the drop of oil hanging from the primary housing mounting bolt. I was then given a song and dance about how they'll make it right, and here I am another week into waiting for more BS, when I decide to call them for a report. I wrote a letter to HD corporate, The BBB, and am planning on letting HD Finance know their loan is now a lame duck, as I am disgusted with this sanctioned robbery and insultive behavior.

"I've been going to this dentist for about 5 years. 

Most of the times I go there (2x year + sometimes a 3rd time per year) I feel the exact same way as L.M.'s review on 1\/27\/2014. I never thought to review Dr. Peters on Yelp because I really believe in giving small businesses a chance- even several chances - before publicly giving a ""meh"" review. Sadly, I am reviewing now with a 1-star review only to say buyer beware.

Both I and a professional staff member at Warner Village Cosmetic and Family Dentistry have recently been working hard at getting some healthcare\/insurance information straightened out for a day guard Dr. Peters recommended for my severe bruxism. The staff member was extremely patient and friendly in trying to explain complicated dental insurance to me. She told me that bottom line there are no guarantees in price because of the way Dental health Insurance companies work. She suggested I call BCBSAZ to feel more comfortable in the numbers. I agreed that was a good idea. No harsh words were ever exchanged in this dental office by the staff or by me. 

Fair enough; I called BCBSAZ to get the real numbers from them. BCBSAZ patiently explained it all to me - and it took about 30 minutes and multiple calculations to explain. Fine with me, becuase yes, dental insurance is quite complex. 

Next step was calling back the dental office to basically report ""yes, let's do the appointment since I now have the price from the source. I told the nice employee that oddly enough, the price I got was a bit different from your price (which neither of us could figure out, but that's ok - I wasn't mad - it was just information that made us go ""huh.""; and I also reported that ""oh, yes, I asked BCBSAZ about a dental claim that was unpaid that you asked me to ask them about when I called them. BCBSAZ told me that they haven't received it but that they received a different amount claim for the same person on the same day from this provider."" 

My intentions were purely to inform and follow up with what they asked me to do. I wasn't mad; the employee didn't seem mad. She said she would have the insurance person follow up with me via email. No problem for me - that's typical in business. 

I'm not sure what went wrong. Next thing I know (within 1 day), I received an emailed, signed PDF\/letter from Dr. Peters that basically said in about 4 paragraphs that since I have lost trust in her clinical skills and her staff, she doesn't find this relationship productive and that she will not treat me anymore. Wow. You be the judge.",0.0

"This happened earlier today: 

As we approached the door, we saw this employee (short, short red hair, heavyset) arguing with a customer at the door. Apparently the store had just closed but he was asking to make a quick payment. She raised her voice at him and said ""NO! YOU CANNOT MAKE A PAYMENT!! WE ARE CLOSED!!!!"" then as she stepped back inside she stared at my husband and me for a second, slammed the door in all three of our faces then walked to the back of the store shaking her head and saying something to the other employees. 

We're moving out of state and came to the store to return our modem. We called the store at 1:30p to verify the address. Why didn't the employee tell us they close at 2pm? This is how we were treated?! She was incredibly rude and definitely disrespectful. Does she think her attitude will assist in customer retention? The man who she yelled at walked away saying, ""Thanks for the help. I'm switching back to Cox!"" We will be following suit.  What a shame one employee represented an entire company so horribly.",0.0
Went with the wife due to being a block away and heard so many great things about this place.  The restaurant was very classy in appearance.  The menu nice and simple which I prefer.  I ordered a sidecar and the wife a lemonade which were both amazing.  The food was very lackluster and reminded me of Dennys but 4 times the price.  I had the vogue steak which cam bland an unseasened.  The sauce needed more time to reduce and tasted bland as well.  The steak tasted as if it was frozen and not fresh.  The wife had the vogue burger which tasted much better then my steak but had too many things going on.  Everything got lost and it was terribly overwhelming and unenjoyable.  The table next to us seemed like regulars and order drinks with a cheese tray.  I think if we were to return we will follow suit and leave the food to someone else.,0.0

"Sadly, I have not been impressed with the Chinese food offered here in Phoenix. 

I had high hopes for Desert Jade and was hoping the food had improved from Gabi's 3-star review back in 2009, but I was not impressed and it seems that the reviews range widely here. 

The three food items we tried tasted fresh, but were seriously lacking in flavor. 

The Wor Won Ton Soup came with a generous serving of shrimp, pork, and beef pieces and vegetables, but the wontons were dense balls of dough that, as another reviewer mentioned, tasted more like gnocchi rather than meat-filled wontons. 

The Beef with Broccoli came with the thinest sauce I've ever had that had the flavor and consistency of beef broth. The beef was a tad overcooked and the broccoli was limp from being overcooked. 

The Chicken Chow Mein was the biggest disappointment as I was looking forward to the big, fat soft noodles that I have enjoyed and every other Chinese restaurant I've ever dined!! The lady on the phone said ""Pan fried?"" when I ordered, which I guess I was supposed to know meant, ""Be prepared for thin, vermicelli-type noodles."" Again, no real flavor to the chow mein dish, though the chicken was tender.

Attempted to play the basketball games and there aren't nearly enough balls inside the games to shoot more than twice within a few seconds. The glass boards that are supposed to keep the balls from rebounding out of the corral were broken on both the games, so if you missed, the ball would either bounce back at your face or behind you and into the walkway or the dining area. Why add unnecessary danger to a place already filled with kids running around all over?

Went to go hit at the batting cages and one of the two helmets we were given had no padding around the ears. They were sprayed with Lysol, at least. Out of the 9 batting cages, only five were working. None of them were marked out of order, though. You just had to spend a token and then walk all the way back to the counter when it didn't work.

Some of the seats in the dining area are in extreme disrepair. I mean, I get that it's not supposed to be a five star restaurant, but is it too much to ask that the stuffing under the vinyl covering not be completely exposed and filthy on at least a quarter of the chairs? The sanitation grade looked decent, though. So at least the chance of food poisoning is low? And the kids seemed to like the pizza.

I know it's a kid place, I get it. But because of that, I would expect it to be relatively safe. This place fails at that.",0.0

"UPDATE: I have been contacted both by phone and by Yelp reply by Qesthetics after my initial review. The aesthetician who worked with me actually gave me a phone call saying that she was sorry and did not know that I was so unhappy with the treatment. She told me that they could offer cortisone injection treatment free by doctors at the clinic. She also explained that the type of surgery she offered was electro-surgery (electrocautery), a procedure she had used on my moles. I had a small scar left from a previous mole removal that was removed fine, however the mole she completely removed electrically actually left what looks like some sort of mole shaped dent on my face. She also told me that she wished that I had come in before writing a negative review and told them about how I felt. 

Unfortunately, despite all this response, I genuinely feel like I am only now being heard thanks to the Yelp platform. Never once did they call or even email me after my treatments to check in and follow up on me. During the treatment I remember having asked multiple times if it would work soon, if I could try something else, and commenting that this treatment is very expensive and slow. I was always told to wait until next time, it will work, it is working, etc. She was automatically dismissed my concerns. However j understand that it's also her job to keep clients coming back and encouraging product purchases. 
Factoring in these points, I've decided to remove her name off the original review and update to 1.5 stars for the follow up customer service, despite the shadiness.

I am still very unhappy with my time at Qesthetics and I don't trust them enough to go back even with the free offers. They care now, but only after I've made it known publicly that I've had an awful experience. I get it, it's ""business"" right? I can only hope not.",0.0

A gentleman from said party of three grew frustrated and went up to smug hostess number one and asked why some of these tables were sat before him, to which she explained the first table had a reservation, and he had overheard that the second table (a party of 4) did not have a reservation when they checked in but were still seated before him. He asked why and she didn't seem to have any answer but apologized lightly, he then resumed his seat and my boyfriend and I watched smug hostess number one look around for hostess number two, or any other employee for that matter, to make extra smug eye contact with as if to communicate her irritation with this group, though she was wrong. STRIKE ONE. Once my boyfriend and I were finally seated, a nice server came to help us. We both ordered ice waters without lemon. When the water arrived and I plunged my straw into said water, I was astonished to see a cloud of murk emerge from the depths of my cup. It looked like random white floaty shreds of gunk. I don't know what this unknown substance was, but needless to say, I lost my appetite. STRIKE TWO. It made me question the cleanliness of the entire establishment, and it made me feel dirty and I honestly can say I won't be going back ever. I'm sad about this because I love the garlic noodles here, but I will have to live without them for fear of eating from dirty dishes. It's disgusting. The health board should probably investigate this... I don't think proper procedure and cleanliness are being executed.",0.0

Food was tasty! We had the 2.5 lb crab legs and the AYCE catfish and shrimp. Food tasted well. Would have given more stars but we were unable to fully enjoy our food due to the annoyance of flies.

3.5 star. Cake was excellent.  I had the pistache cake with raspberries for 6 and ordered a flat white for 3.50. The cake was excellent but the flatwhite was definitely disappointing.  It was more of a latte and did not have enough steamed milk.  Also it came with a lot of foam which it is not supposed to have.  It also had too much espresso.  More than a shot and quite bitter knowing that pilot coffee has premium beans.,0.0
Not sure how this place stays in business. Food is OK but service is always horrible. We usually come back once a year to see if they have fixed it and end up leaving disappointed.  Sat down at 7 to a half empty restaurant and didn't get any food until 8 and the entrees came out first and then they figured out they forgot our salads and appetizer.,0.0

"Völliges Desaster:
Bei der Ankunft im Hotel am Abend wird mir eröffnet, dass der Schlüssel zum Zimmer nicht verfügbar ist. Leider gäbe es zu diesem Zimmer nur EINEN Schlüssel. Trotzdem ließ man mich in das Zimmer und versicherte mir den Schlüssel zu bringen sobald er eingetroffen sei.
Im Zimmer musste ich dann feststellen, dass die Heizung weder im Zimmer noch im Bad funktioniert. Zudem stank es in dem Bad wie in einer Kläranlage.
Da sich bis 22:30 niemand wegen des Schlüssels gemeldet hat fragte ich an der Rezeption nach dem Schlüssel und berichtete die anderen Missstände. 
Nun erhielt ich einen anderen Schlüssel und später einen Radiator gebracht.

"I've been to this location a few times. The first two were just ok. Nothing to write home about, so to speak. So, my boyfriend and I went there yesterday around 11am. There was a 20 minute wait which we were ok with. When we get seated, the waitress was doing her part. She grabbed us some waters, but she put lemon inside my water, which I still don't get because I did not ask for lemon. We just asked if we could get bottled water. That was not a problem, but waiting 35 minutes for our food when I ordered bacon and eggs and my BF ordered eggs Benedict was a little irritating. . The people who sat down next to us got their food before we did and they came in after we had already ordered. I heard them order and they had two omelettes. Why was our food taking so long? When we finally did get our order, my plate had black all around it and I could wipe it off with my napkin. My BF's  food looked like a bagel with a runny mess poured all over it.

"I probably would have eaten here months ago if I hadn't assumed it was an unauthorized Apple retailer. Silly me, I guess.  But uninspired name aside, I thought this place was pretty good.

You get a sense of the hip, bistro vibe a lot of places go for these days, with the walls reminding you in giant letters that their food is locally sourced and sustainable. The crew was all young, but friendly enough and seemed to know what they were doing. 

The menu was large, but I think the macaroni dishes were too few and simple for a place with Mac in the title, but that may not be such a bad thing. There were also traditional Italian pasta selections, as well as some interesting creations that seemed worth trying out.

The create-your-own pasta feature is a great idea but it seems kinda broken. It's 7.25 for your choice of pasta and sauce to start, 1.95 for a meat choice, and .65 for each additional toppings (from a list of enticing toppings of which you will want many). By the time you've set up a basic dish with only one meat and one topping it's an almost $10 pasta. Meanwhile, the most expensive plates on the menu, with multiple meats and toppings included are only around $11.  This is all a long way of saying that it's a much better value just to pick regular menu item and substitute any toppings you don't like for ones you do.

I got the crazy Alfredo (10.50) : fettuccini pasta with chicken breast, shrimp, Italian sausage, roasted peppers, sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, and jalapeños.  The sauce was a little light on flavor and the shrimp were small and not the best quality, but the dish was very large, the ingredients fresh, and overall, quite enjoyable. For the price, I can definitely recommend it.

My wife got pepper jack Mac and cheese and added bacon. I was kind of jealous. It was a generous portion of elbow pasta, cheese, jalapeños, and flavorful bacon. I will probably stick to their Mac dishes from now on.

Mac Shack is a great place if you feel like eating Italian food, but don't want to spend a lot of money or tip. They have a diverse menu that should offer something for everyone, and service is quick.

This place has been around since the 50s, and the decor shows it. Not in a bad way, mind you, as it is clean and well preserved.  Service is always prompt, and they do a good job of keeping the chips\/salsa refilled. On that note, chips are warm and salted just right, but the salsa rates a ""just okay"".  I really enjoy coming here for their cheese crisps and margs. Simple fare, I know, but it makes me happy.  The rest of their fare is decent, though I can't say i have a ""must have"" dish here, though I do enjoy their tacos and 'changas.  All in all, a solid place for Mexican food.

"Someone!Call the old owners!
Another one has just bit the dust in my list. Do you remember the old owners and the friendly staff? It was one amazing place with an exceptional customer service and people who wanted to make it right. The food was so delicious but mostly we came for both- their people skills and great menu.
The new owner has a funny way to deal with problems- to hide. Never called me back. I am not that important after all, I understand, whatever your name is, the ghostman
Instead of friendly skilled girls waitresses we had ,now you have this little young moody thing at the counter who will get even with you if you dare to upset his inattentive unprofessional and unpleasant existence. He'll let you know he's upset by shoveling the dishes, talking back or not saying hello if you tell him he freaking made a mistake on a huge order and you had to drive back and forth to exchange, while kids were waiting and arguing with you. Do they apologize or offer to rectify it just as the old staff would? You wish! We gave them another chance a day later and it was a disaster. My child didn't get her smoothie because the little boy was in a bad mood.
Now about the food. The kids used to love the chicken wings and fried rolls. The wings suddenly got smaller and way over fried.The fresh spring rolls were ok but the fried ones smelled like old oil. Yuk. You should cook with love, not with disgust or trying to get by. The soup is pretty much the same but if you know how it's pretty much precooked then you'll know its very difficult to screw it.

"Spend an extra $20 and stay on the strip.

Rooms here are nice, but everything is an upsell. I even asked for a 2nd drinking glass for the bathroom and they wanted to charge. The room only had 1 towel on arrival and after 3 calls and 2 hours, we finally grabbed towels from a cart down the hall. The staff here is rude and unfriendly, but then again after years of Vegas trips for business and pleasure, it has taken a turn that way most places near the strip.

2 times during the stay on the 10th floor the elevators were down for service (so they said) and here come the stairs, not that I don't need to walk off the calories, but twice in 1 trip to go 10 flights of stairs when I am paying $140\/nt to be in the hotel? The floor staff in the casino was rude and the table games don't have a good flow to them. 

The hotel is loud and seems like a fun environment, but truth be told, I spent 90% of my time at other casinos. The Wi-Fi signal in the room is weak and if you are using a smart device like Ipad, it kicks you off a lot.

The gym is average and make sure if you want to use the ""heated pool"", it will be open, unlike the signs that say open, but security saying it's closed.

Overall, the rooms have soft mattresses and overstuffed pillows if you like that sort of thing, this is your place. I have back issues and the mattress was horrible and I couldn't sleep well. The décor is the rooms and spaciousness is awesome, but that only goes so far when it isn't properly stocked and it's uncomfortable to stay there.

I love salad buffets but unfortunately there isn't very many to choose from. There used to be one across the street  called soup and salad and it was at least 4 bucks less. There is little to no protein on the salad bar portion of the buffet and the soup is mostly watered down or if it is a creamed soup there is a thick crusty layer on top so I try to pass that  up. I go just because I am too lazy to cut up my own veggies sometimes but it does make me miss or regret there isn't other choices.

"Travel is dismayingly full of bait-and-switch mindphuckery, with many cities duking it out for the high distinction of possessing the largest disparity between Expectation and Reality. Monte Carlo at Vegas doesn't have a dog in that fight; it's a rather shining example of ""Well, there ya go."" What you see in photos is what you get. What you glean from the reviews of fellow Yelp-ers and Tripadvisors is, again, what you get: Prime location, B- ambience, amazingly comfortable beds, fitness center, large enough pool that one (namely me) can keep a safe distance from the vacant vocal-fry dialogue of drunk college girls, enough cuisinal offerings to satiate most palettes (unless you have a hankering for Maltese but only if the fenkata preparation is faithful to its historical origins, and if you are this douchebag, please go insert your head in an oven).

I can't vouch for the casino at Monte Carlo, though. I'm not a gambler on the basis that I wouldn't deposit the balance of my checking account into a wood chipper, so what makes an illuminated box with a lever any more sensible? (There was, however, an obnoxiously cute ""OMG Kittens!"" machine, but I abstained). Better question, what the hell does someone like me even do in Vegas? One word: Schadenfreude. Pure Schadenfreude.

The scenic ride up to the Sanctuary Resort where the restaurant is located is minor to the breathtaking view I was greeted with when walking into this restaurant for a first date lunch.

The seating was certainly romantic and absolutely gorgeous.  However the food on a 5 star scale sat at about 2.5. Although it was not ""bad"" it wasn't exactly amazing either, yet they had a menu selection to meet many various diets. I had the flank steak with a pomegranate quinoa,  which was great! However my steak was ""ehhh"" bland and dry. My date had a panini that he really enjoyed and was happy with.  I may come back and give them a try for dinner,  but the views, ambiance and impeccable service,  will definitely bring me back for at least drinks! Great for a lunch date!

"Look, I don't like Vegas, I'm not really into the whole thing so bear that in mind when reading my review.  The place looks really cool. It's going for what I can only summarize as a vintage modern look, and it's got a small shopping and eatery downstairs with its relatively small casino.  Right when you arrive, you'll notice color lit floor panels which can seem pretty cool.  You then walk in and see a bar with a massive TV screen hanging over it which seems pretty cool.  You walk past the exclusive pool club with the pretty girls and I guess that's pretty cool, and you walk by the concierge office which looks like a chic lounge which is pretty cool.  Then you check in, and walk to the elevator room FULL OF MIRRORS, which is pretty cool. Then you go into your room, which is SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS, which is pretty cool.

Then you stay there for the night, and everything that seemed pretty cool, turns out not to be at all.  (except the tv above the bar...that thing is still pretty cool.)  The whole place is a big club for twenty year old girls who want to get wasted and yell obscenities and think they're cute doing it.  The color lit floor panel at night doubles as a dance floor with a DJ and there were like 3 women dance on that floor(if it is a dance floor) and it looked sad.  The music was incredibly loud and I couldn't eat my pizza and talk on my phone simultaneously because it was that loud.  ALL the furniture, while visually attractive are horribly uncomfortable to sit in for a long period of time.  the 4 times I used the elevator, I got stuck holding the elevator for a group of twenty year old girls taking a selfie of themselves in front of the mirror room and then  crowd into the elevator talking at 5 million decibels in a tiny elevator. The mirror hotel room that I stayed in was frustrating because while my room mate was watching TV, it was impossible to read because even if I tried to cover the screen with my tablet, I can see the screen from every periphery....because mirrors.  Every light that was in that room seemed to be amplified four times because of mirrors.  

In summary, if you're a female, and you're twenty...and you like to annoy me in the elevator with talk of getting your hair wet and how that creep kept trying to buy you a drink and you like mirrors.  Consider this a 5 star review, because you'll love it...I for one don't really want to come back.

This place gives a whole new meaning to 'going to Church!' We ended our Saturday night wandering here and I was surprised to see how dead it was close to 2am. It looked like it should be a fun spot with seating both near the bar and up in the balcony. Music was Top40 and upbeat. Maybe Madison took the night off? The jury is out on how I feel about this place.,0.0

"Allgemein
Zusammenfassend:
Riesiges Restaurant (ca 500). Deswegen über den Abend immer ungepflegter manches wird nur sehr sporadisch aufgefüllt. 
Keine Bedienungen. Benutzte Teller müssen selber abgeräumt und auf einen völlig überfüllten Servierwagen gestellt werden.
Das Essen ist Durchschnitt. Habe schon schlechter Asia gegessen.

Es fehlt der gute Geist des Hauses der über alles ein wenig den Blick hat. Über den Abend wirkt alles einfach sehr vernachlässigt. 

Bedienung
Praktisch nicht vorhanden. Teller muss man auch selbst webringen. Bei uns und bei allen anderen Tischen wird nichts abgeräumt.
Keine der vorhandenen MA schaut gross nach dem Buffet. Manches wird aufgefüllt, anderes wie Sambal Oelek, Knobi und Ingwer war den ganzen Abend leer.
Das Essen
Im Grunde haben wir von allem gegessen. Geschmacklich war alles ok. Wer aber original Asia sucht wird sich hier nicht wohl fühlen. 
Das Ambiente
Riesengroß. Kommt ein wenig wie eine riesige Essenabfertigungsanlage. Sehr laut. Asia Ambiente kommt nicht auf.
Sauberkeit
Aufgrund der grossen Menschenmenge (ca 500 Sitzplätze) ist das Klo nach gewisser Zeit nicht mehr in so tollem Zustand. Vom Personal wird da auch nichts über den Abend gemacht.
Ich hatte insgesamt das Gefühl es fehlt die sonst in Asiarestaurants strenge Chefin die den Laden im Griff ha und über alles ein wenig einen Blick hat.",0.0
"This place might be challenging to really enjoy if you don't speak a little bit of Spanish. While the menu is in English and Spanish, I did a lot of translating between the waitress and my gringo boyfriend. ;) 

Food here is fairly authentic and so, so cheap. It's hard to believe the amount of food you get for the price. Papusas & tamales for $2, huaraches for $4, tacos for $6... Incredible! Quality is pretty inconsistent -- some dishes are great and others below average. The same dish might even be great on one visit and not good the next. 

Overall, worth a visit though, especially if you catch them on a good day! So, grab yourself a Spanish speaking friend and head to Lempira! I prefer weekend lunch when the place is full.",0.0
"WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER HAD. Never in my life have I had such a bad experience in a restaurant. Milestones completely lost control of their restaurant last night. It was actually sad to watch. We were taking out our family who just arrived from Ireland earlier that day, to somewhere I thought would be 'impressive', god were we wrong. 

First of all we ordered drinks- It took 25 MINUTES for our waiter to bring them out. We stopped another waiter in the mean time and asked him why it was taking so long, his response was 'we are short staffed and super busy' and that there 'is only 1 barman', 1 BARMAN in the whole in bar. We then proceeded to order our food (I thought in my head that the food can make up for the drinks taking ages). The food came out after a long 50 minutes. It was all STONE COLD. All the steaks were rare, after we asked for three medium and one well done. They mixed up our order bringing out three mash potato, instead one meant to be with fries . ..  The fries that they did bring out were BURNED TO A CRISP and looked like they had been cooked over and over... AND there were forks and knives missing from the table.

At that point for the first time in my life I said we were sending this crap back. I wouldn't have fed it to a dog. It was completely inedible. We called over the manager and told her exactly how we felt, we told her to taste the steak. She completely admitted defeat, saying repeatedly' I don't know what to say, I don't know what to say, your totally right. its a disgrace.' In my eyes I think that the manager should have stopped people coming in the front door, obviously knowing she had completely lost control of the restaurant. She then tried to win us back, offering us drinks, another meal and vouchers. We said no, honestly all we wanted to do was get out of there. I told her that I  would never come back again even if you paid me. So we walked out still starving.

I let her know I would write this review on Yelp too. What a let down and embarrassment for the first night our family were in Canada. Angry and disappointed.",0.0

"I moved to Arizona from Minnesota and with a degree already. I have spent more time being frustrated and waiting hours to even speak with councelers here at Mesa Community, and when I did speak with them they were absolutely no help. I was constantly feeling rushed to get out of the office, and I really do feel like my education there was a waste of time. 

I wanted to get another degree, and have more possibilities, but Mesa Community has made it where I don't even want to go back to school because the admissions is outrageously ridiculous to even understand, or work with one on one (ya know, to make sure you understand and your going down the right path). 

I truly felt unvalued there, and I set up a month to month payment plan to pay for my tuition, and now the school is stating I still owe my entire tuition, in which I had this paid off last year, and I am just getting messages from the school now?.... Super frustrating, again.

"This is probably why you wouldn't see filipino dishes plated in a fancy restaurant. That's because this is how most fiipinos like to eat. They want the food that they associate with growing up from mom and pop's house. Eating here is probably the most authentic filipino food that you're gonna get.

Here goes,, you line up,, you connect eyes with one of the people behind the counter. Tell them how many rice youre gonna need. Then you pick up a dish or two to eat with your rice. You move down, tell them what you want to drink. Pay for your food, pick a table and proceed to enjoy filipino food.

Ok, now food... we ordered Chicken Inasal, Whole Squid and 4 Orders of rice. The chicken was sorta dry,, i don't know how you can dry up leg quarters, but it was. The taste was a little bland as well. The rice ""that night"", I'm sure it's different every night, tasted like it was about to turn. The savior of all the dishes, the squid. It was damn good squid!

"Let me start by saying the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of the fantastic service and the cod fritters. Our servers were very attentive and did our best to help our friend who is allergic to mushroom... not an easy task since it seems like everything had mushrooms in it. Went there with my wife and some good friends. Most of us had been waiting to go here for a long long time. We started with some cod fritters which were so fantastic that we thought we were in for a memorable meal... it was... but for mostly the wrong reason. 

Several people at the table ordered THE speciality here, Duck in a can. It was absolutely terrible. First the fatty skin was not rendered at all so when it came out of the can it was one of the most un-appealing meal I have ever seen. Just a big chunk of fat on top of the duck. The duck was incredibly tough and really not edible. We sent it back (and again this goes back to good service, there were prompt and apologized) and they claimed it had a tendon in the breast but this was seemingly the case for the whole table. I had the pig's foot ""stuffed"" with foie gras and it clearly wasn't stuffed since the foie gras was just  sitting on top. That would have been fine but the meal was completely ""one note"" and had no outstanding flavors at all. The pouding chomeur was quite good in the end but not enough to redeem the meal and not enough to warrant how expensive the meal was. The room is also ridiculously loud and the floors by the bathrooms so greasy that it's treacherous to try and go in there. We won't come back here.",0.0

We visited Canteen during TIFF. We wanted to have wine and ordered two glasses of Pino Grigio. The menu does not offer any appetizer that goes well with wine so we decided to order a Margarita Pizza. The wine (at $9.75 for 6 oz!) was the worst wine I have ever had! The pizza was not any better. It was basically a large bread with some tomato sauce on it. The server was more or less at the same level. He was hardly reachable and provided a very poor service. The poor service might have been due to high volume though.,0.0
"To a couple of days after Turkey day I was helping someone move and I was using my flat bed trailer.

Well It took pretty long for one even though they didn't seem busy at all.  To put the good tire on the right sized rim cost 27.00 and change.  As I was pulling out I called a local popular tire store and they said 10.00 to change it out and balance it.  Pep boys was going to charge me extra to balance it but the guy said he wrote it up a different way to save me money.   What??!!

"Let's start with the atmosphere it's super cool and there is so much to see. So much that it being my first time there I was confused and overwhelmed. I manage a café so coffee is kind of my expertise ... Ice cream is another favorite of mine and their mix ins are over the top with choices. 

3 of us went. My partner got an affagato (which we normally love almost anywhere) and she couldn't finish it because the espresso was too bitter. Could be her tastebuds but, none the less this was her complaint. 

I tried the soy coffee ice cream and it was like a jelly consistency that I didn't think I could stomach so against my better judgement I went with birthday cake ice cream (no mix ins) no complaints other than ice cream kills my stomach. 

My son got vanilla ice cream with Reese's cups (keeping it simple) he got a whole scoop and when it came out of the mixer it was barely half a cup. This led to disappointment when I went to pay and gasped at $16 bill for 3 tiny items. They are way over priced even if they are in shady side. Another downfall is that if you pay with a credit card they charge you an extra $1 to the already out of this world prices. Would I go back? Probably not I'm glad I saw the store and their cool decor but, for the lack of being impressed it's a no go.

I bought a 2014 Toyota 4Runner about 3 weeks ago, a Friday. I notice something was wrong with car when I test drove it (exhaust issues)... I didn't want to purchase it until it was fixed, however I was told I should by the salesmen (who RUSHED ME). Because I am gullible, I went ahead and purchased it. Wednesday was the day they SUPPOSEDLY fixed it. And in the state of Nevada, once you purchase a vehicle, it is yours. Of course the next day I drove it and it still sounded shitty. And not only that, but the brakes were squeaking. I just purchased this vehicle. I complained and COMPLAINED about it and wanted my car that I traded in back and of course that didn't happen. They insisted to fix it or I had the choice to trade it in for another one that would cost me over 850.00\/monthly. If I was gonna pay that much I'd go somewhere else. And because this place and the sales people are ridiculous, I waited for my green slip, 3 weeks later, and I took my business elsewhere. FINDLAY TOYOTA helped resolve this problem and I happily purchased a 2015 Toyota 4Runner. I wish I went to FINDLAY TOYOTA first because my experience at Centennial was a complete NIGHTMARE!!!

Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place for Sunday brunch. We called at 10:55 and were told there was no wait, so we drove to The Egg I Am. 

We arrived and were told there 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated (wtf?) which is fine given it was a Sunday morning - but why lie about that on the phone? Okay, whatever.

We were seated after about 15 minutes at a booth right behind the host stand. I felt like I was on a cruise ship, because the guy sitting behind me was fidgeting and it shook our entire table. I figured I wouldn't say anything about it since I would be focused on eating my food in just a few minutes.

Our server came by; she was friendly and took our order. I got the daily special - a ""BTO"" croissant. While we were waiting for our food, the couple sitting behind us left and two workers came by to clean up their table. They proceeded to bitch about how messy people left tables and how customers would leave their own kitchens in the manner in which they left restaurant tables. Okay, it is COMMON SENSE to not bitch about your job\/customers around other patrons! Like, I understood their frustrations, but seriously..m professionalism please?

So we get our food. My sandwich was SOGGY, meaning the croissant was previously frozen and microwaved. Ugh. The food was completely lackluster, unmemorable, and average at best. Little egg\/meat, tons of greast, canola oiled potatoes. We get our check and are ready to leave when I notice I was overcharged for my meal.

The special was listed as $8.79. I was charged $9.99 plus $0.99 for substituting egg whites. Nowhere did it say egg whites were extra, but whatever. So I go up to this counter and explain to the apathetic 16 year old hostess that I was overcharged. She called over her manager, who looked at my bill, rolled her eyes, and mumbled to the girl ""This is a $0.20 difference"" as if to imply that I was some cheap idiot wasting her time. I pointed out that actually I had been overcharged $2.20, NOT $0.20. She rolled her eyes, fixed my tab, and walked away.

Seriously lady? Even if it WAS only $0.20, then YOU can pull the change out of YOUR pocket to pay my tab. I was appalled at the rudeness of the staff at this ""establishment."" I can honestly say it was the first meal\/restaurant to leave a sour taste in my mouth.

She lady on the phone asked if I would like to INCLUDE A TIP, and I replied that I would once the driver got there. So when the driver came he asked me to sign the receipt. The total said $8.99!!!  which I thought was a bit PRICEY for 6 WING DINGS. The driver stated that he had ANOTHER DELIVERY to make so to called the store. The first THREE TIMES I called no one answered. I figure it was because the DRIVER called the store to inform them of my DISSATISFACTION. So when the women answered the phone I inquired about the EXTRA CHARGES. She told me that it was the taxes, then .50 cents for the BLUE CHEESE, .50 cents TO USE MY CARD, and $1 FOR THE DELIVERY (they are only about 2 BLOCKS AWAY ON THE SAME STEET mind you). I told her it would of been NICE if she had told me about all the EXTRA CHARGES when I ordered. The lady became RUDE and ARRAGANT so to avoid the ARGUMENT she was trying to start I told her she did not have to worry about receiving MY business again.  So I did the MATH MYSELF and that's NOT EVEN TRUE because if those charges were CORRECT then my total would have been around $9.25. Like why would I have to pay extra for blue cheese and why would she ask me if I wanted to include a tip when they already charge a delivery fee. So after I did all this I went to eat my 6 HIGH PRICED WING DINGS and guess what they were not even GOOD. So if you were considering ordering from here DONT because they will make up charges if they think they could get away with it. They probably NEED to do this to because they probably DONT GET VERY MANY CUSTOMERS. If I could give this place a NEGATIVE RATING I would.",0.0

"This is about my 5th visit of Mon Ami Gabi. The menu has changed slightly and they no longer have the baked Brie, but they do have some fun new stuff like a ""pulled pork bahn mi"" (not very French, but it was tasty). 

Steak frites is always a safe option and it comes with a variety of sauces to choose from. My favorite is still the au poirve, which is the peppercorn brandy sauce. The baguette they serve you is very tasty and I try very hard to not fill up on it, but how can you owe up a hot and fresh baguette?

The country pate is also quite yummy but mild in flavor, which I don't mind. It comes with area pieces of toasty bread, whole grain mustard, a few sprigs of fresh watercress, and well as a variety of pickled items. It's a yummy starter to share, but a little much to eat all on your own as a starter.

But good thing we did come back, we went during a weekday and the place was pretty slow but yet our server was still on top of things, even though he was playing bartender as well, we started off with a mushroom flatbread which was pretty tasty.

Cut my chin open on the rainbow racers. Was bleeding and the lifeguards did nothing just called an emt.

No incident report nothing was done. We left and came back around 2 we got there at 1030 and I was hurt around 11. Our cabana was covered in ants but I didn't say anything I was bleeding and it wasn't really stopping. I email customer support and randy called we to speak. I met him and he appologized and said the emt said he offered us an incident report which he didn't. He offered to give me a 50 percent refund on our cabana. I told him can you just upgrade our passes to season passes so we can come back. He came back and said he would only charge us 20 bucks a peice for season passes nice upsell on the injured guest! I took him up on it just to be able to recover the 250 bucks I spent but man no water proof bandaids? And who is the emt that couldn't even help me? Then you basically call me a liar and upsell me season passes? You should be careful if I was a lawyer or had legal counsel this could have gone different.

"Do. Not. Come. For. The. Coffee.

Even though there is a special stand-up card on every table speaking sooooo highly about the quality of the restaurant's coffee and it's super special artisanal-ness, it was burnt swill. I drink coffee rarely anymore so when I decide to have a cup I'm very selective. After reading said little stand up card I thought, surely for all this marketing, there must be something to the coffee here. Not so much. It was worse than the burnt roasts at Starbucks. And to be fair - in case the particular pot that poured my cup had sat too long - I requested a new cup from a fresh pot. Same thing. Even the manager that I spoke with after the meal rolled his eyes when I talked about the coffee and basically said it had the quality of gasoline.

But I get ahead of myself. Let's return to the beginning because the coffee is not alone in the mediocrity that was Snooze that day.

When you come during a busy time, expect a wait. That doesn't bother me at all - the bustle of an exciting and popular restaurant and a little wait tells me that many folks are happy to be eating there - and it's usually an indication of great quality food and service. Once a table became available, we did get stuck in a back corner next to a pile of high chairs, the swinging back patio door, and under an air conditioning fan. The only thing that saved me from freezing was the regular opening of the door letting in the warm summer air as servers went in and out. So not the best table and not the best climate control, but all in all that wasn't going to get us down.

The restaurant was slammed. I might also say that during busy hours, Do. Not. Come. For. The. Service. It's so disappointing that we as patrons should need to avoid certain hours of the day because waitstaff whose job it is to know how to wait tables properly during their ENTIRE SHIFT simply cannot manage to hold it together when it's time to MOVE QUICKLY AND SMARTLY.

Our server couldn't manage that. We waited for someone to take our first drink order (that lovely coffee) an unreasonable amount of time. Once she showed up, she was distracted and never once looked us in the eye. Every interaction with her during the visit found her constantly looking ahead to her next task, her next stop - so much so that she seemed to already be gone from the table by the time she got there. And to top it off, she put on the fake sugary patronizing voice that makes it SOUND like she cared about what was being asked for, but her mind was elsewhere. And when we did ask for something - cream, natural sugar - it took an unreasonable amount of time to receive it.

It's unfortunate that now I can't remember much about the food. I think it was fine - maybe even inventive. I might have had a Benedict (?) with an interesting rendition of asparagus (?). I think my husband enjoyed whatever he ate too. I waited too long to write this review for starters, but my memory of the food is eclipsed by the poor service and the supercilious attitude of our server.

But then there was also this.

Two women were seated at about the same time next to us. They ordered pancakes (JUST PANCAKES) and REQUESTED the pancakes be cooked well in the middle. This order was taken right around the time of our coffee order. Their pancakes arrived right around the time our food order was taken. The pancakes were RUNNY in the middle. They sent them back.

The server that was working with them didn't apologize, didn't assure them that it would be made right, didn't demonstrate care one way or the other that the kitchen messed up or that she put crap food down for two people she's supposed to be caring for. Her attitude was rather that she was terribly inconvenienced by the whole thing and it now threw a wrench into her works.

Our food came. We ate - leisurely and talking. Out of the corner of my eye I watched the table next to us. They sat. And waited. We ate. And talked. They waited some more. No one came to tell them it would ""be just a few more minutes and we're so sorry for the mix up"". At one point someone came and delivered a side of bacon. OF BACON! They had the balls to slap down a side and run away when the main course wasn't even present. Poor, poor, POOR SERVICE.

We finally finished our meal. The pancakes finally showed up. It had to have been 20-30 minutes later. For pancakes, people. Pancakes. A 6-10 minute dish and you couldn't be bothered to get it together and treat these women well.

Pitiful.

We paid. And after stopping to express my apologies to the women for how they were treated at Snooze, I went straight to the manager to tell him just how piss-poor their service was. (And how the coffee was burnt swill.) To his credit, he said he would make it right immediately and he was confident the ladies would be happy by the time they left. I really hope that meant comping their entire bill.

"I've been coming here since it was very small. It has grown immensely. The diversity of animals is fantastic and you can get close to the animals. Also the sea lions are a great addition. The animals are definitely the star (how it should be). However that's where the good stops. Even though the entrance fee was high ($100 for 2 adults and 2 kids) everything in the zoo is an extra charge and not quite proportionate for what you get. In addition, the crowd control for the train and the safari tram is poor. They tell you first come first serve. We waited in the boarding area for twenty minutes and people that walked up just as the tram got there were let on before we were and then the tram was full. The next tram was a half hour wait. There was no queue or way to ensure the people that were there first were boarded first. 

The attendant quickly offered a refund, but did not apologize, just shrugged. They honestly don't care. 

At the train there was a school field trip. We tried to ride 3 different times and were told that the field trip had priority and we would not be able to ride.

"I gave them one star only because you can't rate them a ZERO. Using Jaburg was the worst experience of my life. After i paid a $10,000 retainer (not a misprint)! to use the SR partner I was shuffled off to a JR assoc. The sole and only interest any employee or partner of this firm has is to milk as much huge money out of you as they can. I was triple tier billed-partner, associate and paralegal for coinciding issues. The ONLY corporate culture at this firm is to treat the client like they are a flaming idiot and speak down to them with disgust, disdain, and disrespect. They know that to switch firms in the middle of your divorce will cost you $20,000-$30,000 more in retainer so they kill you with the absurd fees. I was treated like a criminal defendant not a divorce plaintiff. 

I spent over $80,000!!!! on my divorce. And once the associate decided that they couldn't make enough money off of me I was dumped cold. HE told me this was the reason without a hint of shame, and left me with outstanding issues. I assume it is their intent to emotionally exhaust you, bill you outrageous amounts, and leave you so destroyed as a person that you don't have the energy to file a Bar Complaint against them. 

If I wanted continuous verbal abuse, ignored emails and unreturned phone calls combined with shocking and seemingly un-substianted bills I would have just stayed married. 

If you want to survive a divorced and\/or bankruptcy with any shred of dignity whatsoever, do yourself a favor and turn and run the other direction!

After the game, the narrow bar quickly turned into a dance club. The DJ gave a very nice set of Hip Hop and R&B. They showed the music videos on the TV screens, which is a nice touch. The bar tenders were more attentive than at your average dance club. Overall, this is not a bad little place.",0.0

"If only I could warn everyone about this school, even though they should never be referred to as such. I completed 57 credits and somehow managed to accumulate over $50,000 in student loans, not including my out of pocket expenses. I was consistently lied to about the loans and now I'm so far in debt that there is no end in sight. The enrolment officers are not well trained and provide false information. The academic and financial advisors also hide the truth. Out of the 57 credits only 14 transferred, which intelligence is not an issue as I'm a 4.0 GPA student at my other school, which is actually academically credible. The school lies to obtain government money and preys upon lower income individuals. You will struggle to find a job with any degree you obtain from here as the quality of education is comparable to a primary level. Often teachers do not meet the necessary requirements standards to teach classes so we played a lot of games in class. Tests are never actually given, except a few online one for math. Teachers hand other student papers to other class member to grade, what's the point of paying the teacher if the students are doing their job. If you like writing papers that mean absolutely nothing and not actually read by most teachers than this school is for you. What can you really expect to learn in 5 weeks and still wonder why you cant get a job after attending UOP. When you do need to transfer good luck getting those transcripts as the school does everything in their power to delay that process. Almost a month now, many emails and phone calls and still no response to the documents I need to transfer properly, go figure. Society needs to do itself a favor and ban and discredit this ""business"" as it is a complete waste of time and massive amounts of money. Almost 10 years later and I still cant get back on my feet because of this school. No wonder it is such a joke. Did I forget to mention this a school you can cheat to get through because guess what a fellow student got caught plagiarizing and the school received complaints but took n measures to reprimand that student by any means. Numerous complaints were made but that student still got an A. Sadly this institution gives a bad name and creates a fear for others who wish to pursue higher education. There is a reason many celebrities (Family guy, Tosh) and others out there publicly make fun of the school. Do yourself a favor and jump in a giant hole before you attend this school, same principle.",0.0
"I must disclose I frequent a similar restaurant on the west side so I compare what I had from Silver Dragon to the other place. I kept reading GLOWING reviews from the Arizona Republic about this place and also noticed all the rewards the Arizona Republic awarded this place so I thought I must give it a try. I also note that I may not have tried the dishes that suit me most.

Silver Dragon is a small independently owned restaurant that offers Hong Kong Style Food. They offer American Chinese Favorites on one menu and have another menu of Authentic Style Chinese Food.

We started with the Buddhist Style Rolls. If I never had them before I'd think they were good. I'm used to them being tasty, crispy, light and not oily. These were stuffed with more vegetables but the tofu skin had a chewy texture that I don't like as much. These had less flavor and also leaked oil. For me they were not as good as I'm used too.

The dish that I tried that was a good solid dish was the Yu Fu with Eggplant. The Yu Fu is described as some sort of fish and egg dumpling. It was very fluffy and light and didn't taste like fish at all. This dish had nice flavors that anybody would like.

We did some take out to have latter.

I've had Fungus and Tofu before so I had an expectation of what it might be like. The Fungus from here looked similar but might have been a different kind as it had a texture to it that was very different. The fungus from Silver Dragon was had a tough thin but almost crunchy kind of texture unlike the delicate soft delicate kind I had before. The soup part was not for me and might be delicious to other people. It was sort of like egg drop mixed with pieces of fish and shrimp with chunks of tofu and the chunks of fungus. 

We took home the two Filet Mignon Dishes they make. One is called French Style and the Other is called Hong Kong Style. I do note that both dishes gave you LOTS of buttery soft beef. Maybe due to my taste I didn't find either one delicious and to me were really OK at best. The French Style had very little flavor and tasted like weak beef stock. The Hong Kong Style did have more flavor but it was unbalanced and on the sweet side.

It's possible that with all the Hype from the Arizona Republic that they were scrambling to feed the new masses of people and may be not have been working on full speed so my exsperience might not be typical. Also my taste may differ from yours. You will certainly get very large portions that contain large amounts of meat here.

"This review is not for food but for service.

My husband and I had reservations for 8.30 on a Friday night. I called and made a reservation since I had read about the place being small and didn't want to wait. We arrive 5mins before 8.30 and see four people waiting for tables. They tell me that they had made reservations for 7.45 and are still waiting. 

8.25pm: It's really cold outside and I'm about to ask my husband to come in and wait (there was place for two more people to stand) when the waiter(or manager... Not sure) asked me to wait outside and that we would have a table in 5 mins. 

8.30pm: I go out and wait... It starts snowing now and more people come and few leave.

8.40pm: A couple went to the store across and waited and another couple that came after us went inside and stood. The waiter\/manager didn't ask them to wait outside and they were safe from the biting cold of Feb 13th. 

8.45pm: My husband now was losing patience so I go in and ask how long it would be (the 7.45 people are still waiting too). He tells me 5 mins and thats what he tells to the other couple who came after us too.

8.55pm: Its still snowing and the wind is to much to bear. I take one last peek through the window, notice that people are still eating main course and leave.

I agree that one cannot ask a customer to finish up and leave (whish is what the server told me), but making a customer who has reservations wait is not fair either. 
He didn't let my husband and I wait inside but let another couple and thats ok too. 
The least he could have done is provided us with a cup of hot tea which he apparently serves for free to people inside but not to customers standing out in the cold. 
I know that waiting for 20\/25 mins doesn't seems like a big deal but in winter and outside, even 5 mins seems long. 
We obviously had a hard time finding another place since most places had a wait time and finally found a table at Kimchi Korea House which had pretty good food.

"Came here using a Groupon for a party, 2 lanes for 2 hours. A couple members were coming late but the workers were very accommodating and let us start one lane first and the second lane when the rest of the party came so we could have the full 2 hours on each lane. Something about the nachos and cheese was addicting, and luckily our Groupon included 2 plates. One of our lanes had to constantly get help because it wouldn't clear the pins and the other lane was miscounting the pins - it would count a certain pin to be bowled over even if it wasn't which was great for our scores but maybe others wouldn't appreciate it.",0.0

"Doubles were delicious, Rotis were great (and huge, one is easily enough for two people).

Maybe it's not everyone's experience, but it was mine.

"There is no 0 star rating on Yelp, otherwise I would give this terrible place one. 

Check out this place on BBB. It has an F, and some terrible, unresolved complaints. Add this one to the list:

We booked a Valentine's weekend staycation on booking.com a week ago, but when we show up, they tell us they can't give us a room because we live in Glendale, 25 miles from the hotel. There's a sign on the counter which says they can't rent rooms to people who live within a 20 mile radius of the hotel. We're outside of that radius. The front desk fellow (Keith) told us that the policy has changed, and it's now a 30 mile radius. He said (rudely) that if we ""knew the reputation of Van Buren"" we'd understand. The crass implication in his voice seemed to imply that my fiance must be a prostitute given the neighborhood's old reputation. Needless to say, we were pissed. We are respectable, hard-working, tax-paying people with a house in the suburbs who were looking for a cheap room close to downtown for the weekend, and this is how we get treated.

Furthermore, there was no one in management available to whom we could complain about how rudely this employee had treated us. We tried to air our grievances to the other person at the front desk (Britney) but she proceeded to yell at us. Here's a basic lesson in customer service for you: when a customer says ""You're being abrasive"", don't angrily shout ""I'm not abrasive!"" Who is training these people?

"If you know me you know that I don't usually write bad reviews, I try to keep it positive and help suggest great places to eat versus some who seem to get their kicks from ripping some places reputation to shreds.

The server was very good but it took a little while for the food to come to the table.  While it was lunch, I noticed that they were not as busy as they usually are.  I had the stuffed pizza and my friend had a few big slices.  The food was served hot and was acceptable, however, several hours later we were both not feeling well.  I'll spare you the gross details but lets just say, it was to much of a coincidence to not believe it was something we ate.

"As other Yelpers have mentioned - this is a Vietnamese restaurant. We were also expecting Cajun food while this place was in progress and were surprised by the menu when we came in. Unfortunately we did not stay for our first visit since they were out of the bread to make their bahn mi, and weren't serving seafood until after 3:00pm. Since we were expecting Cajun and weren't in the mood for pho we left to return at a later date. They did serve us seafood on our return lunch visit so I believe they have wisely changed that policy. 

Our first actual visit was this weekend and in general we were impressed with the food and service. The establishment was clean and the waitress was attentive. We started by splitting a pound of snow crab which came out super fresh and delicious. The crab legs came with an interesting spicy dipping sauce which was good to sample but I think I will order lemon butter in the future. I guess I am a bit of a traditionalist there.

We each had one bahn mi for our main and they were delicious - and spicy! I opened my sandwich about half way through to find thinly sliced fresh jalapeño. This was my first bahn mi experience so I am not sure if it is supposed to be that spicy, but I ended up taking out two of the slices. The banh mi are only $4.50 which is a bargain for lunch so we will definitely be back.",0.0

"Absolute worst customer service of any Journey's locations I've ever been, and being a converse family, we've been to our fair share of Journey stores.

That is not at all fair for paying customers who take time out of their busy schedules. The second problem is that each and every time my husband has left this office his dental issues have reoccured worse than before. This is all coming straight from our pockets because we are not covered for dental.

"I used to be all about Edge fitness. But have learned at this point that their accounting team does NOT know what they're doing. I had a membership with them for 3 years+. And have always had problems with my account. Unable to find my name ( and being hassled that I don't have an account), no contact info (which is required to sign up), autopayments not coming out when they should (leading up to a similar situation to below). 

At this point it's worth the move across the street to Snap Fitness. 

Two months ago my credit card was stolen. On the arrival of my new card, I made the mistake of forgetting to update my gym... Fair enough. That's my responsibility. But I never received ONE phone call or update that my account had not been paid for the first or even second month. No biggie. At some point I would expect a call or at least a letter of non payment. Instead, I get a phone call from a collections agency! I had to pay $115 because of TWO months of no payment?! Even doctors offices aren't that ruthless. A simple mistake on my end. My responsibility, I get that. But collections THAT quick? That's just bad customer service. And it was sent directly to collections with no effort of making the client (me) aware of nonpayment. My membership is $19.99 a month. I only owed $40. A simple phone call, email, or letter for awareness would have handled the situation, saved my $70 unnecessarily spent dollars, and kept a long term customer.

"I had never tried Mama Lolas before so I got a few different things. Nothing was really all that good.  The chicken tenders are frozen processed compressed chicken. Tasted like rubber, inedible. The fried oreos tasted like burnt chocolate. The pizza was alright. Mediocre. I also got the mac and cheese bites and they were alright but I've had way better pretty much everywhere else ive had them. And lastly I got garlic parm wings which were equally as disappointing. I ordered extra crispy but they were slimy and gross. Wasted 10 bucks in them because I couldn't even eat them. The sauce was alright but not much parm to it. Pretty much just butter. Overall I feel as though I wasted my money because I wasn't pleased with anything I ordered. The staff and customer service was great though.  It's not the staff, it's entirely the food that is just plain disgusting.",0.0
"Where should I start? Went there Saturday night after I have gone to another party. My brother suggested the place because a friend of his is a regular. Found a place to sit at the bar and waited a little bit to order a drink. Well, I would've had a better chance of winning the lottery, getting struck by lightning and getting into an accident before getting a drink. I hailed both bartenders several times and I didn't even get either of them to give me a drink. My brother had to go to the end of the bar, yell at the bartender so we could get a pitcher of beer and some ""sorry I couldn't get to you sooner"" popcorn. The karaoke thing is a joke, I waited until last call and my name never got called. I have been to enough places and your song usually gets played. Well, last call came up and of course no one asked me if I wanted a drink or anything. In fact, service there is so bad, the bartender never picked up her tip. WTF?  Needless to say, I will never go back there. Also, I don't mind dive bars at all, it's shitty service that I can't stand. Do yourself a favor, unless you go with a ""regular"", don't even think about setting foot there. IT FUCKING SUCKS!",0.0
"Had to go to the ER for fever and muscle soreness. First they made me get up 4 times like I was not in pain. Second they just let kids run around and not say anything to the parents. Dude some of us are legitimately sick. NEVER GO HERE. THEY dont care if your pain is being managed or if you have been throwing up. They let you go in and out to the waiting room, and sit there while you suffer. Please, just go to urgent care.",0.0
"Just an absolute awful experience a few nights ago. To be clear, I typically enjoy Bar Louie locations pretty much wherever they are. Friday night was not one of those nights. It surprised me that the bar and restaurant were not crowded when we got there, but now I know why. Service was poor, attitudes were negative, and it took forever to get anything. Everyone working there looked grumpy or had very cynical or sarcastic comments to make. Didn't look like anyone working enjoyed spending any part of their lives there and they wanted to pass it on to their guests. 

Since we had already eaten across the street we had just stopped in for some drinks and dessert before heading back to the hotel. Mistake. We perused the dessert menu and one member of our group decided to get the chocolate cake. Then the waiting began. After 5-10 minutes we talked to the bartender about their desserts and asked about how they made them or whether they were made in-house, etc. His response? ""It takes too long and costs too much to make. Nobody buys that crap."" WOW... Nice job building value in your company, your product, and your guests' confidence in their decision. While I do appreciate the honesty of telling us they don't actually make the cake, they could probably form their response with a little more tact. 

The waiting continues. After about 20-25 minutes of waiting on the cake we are ready to scrap the order altogether, especially since we were waiting a ridiculous amount of time for a pre-made purchased cake that they just needed to slap on a plate. When we decided to pay up and leave we got nothing but grief from the staff about not wanting the cake anymore. What a miserable place to be - whether working there or dining there.",0.0
"At 5 pm today I went to the Oakville location for my first (and last) ever Zoup experience. I am feeling a little under the weather, so I thought a nice bowl of soup would be the best thing. When I arrived, the unenthusiastic teenager they had working the Frontline offered to let me taste test any of their soups before purchasing. On my second spoonful (testing the butternut squash soup) I had to immediately spit back up the soup ad it SCALDED my lips and tongue- I cried out in pain and tears filled my eyes. I informed the employee that the soup was far too hot to serve, he turned to his Co worker and asked if the soups had been checked for temperature yet today...to which she replied ""I don't know."" When  this employee went to check the temperature of the soup I had just been given, he said ""oh, it's 171 degrees F"" Ummmmmm are you people trying to take my skin off? Are you asking for a lawsuit? And after all that, I was offered a lazy ""uh...sorry?"" And only after I reiterated to the staff how badly I was hurt. I wanted to purchase soup so I joked that maybe I should wait an hour for the soup to be cool and for my tongue to heal, then when I went to pay my debit card was giving trouble going through. I got frustrated and left. They could have at least offered the soup to me for free considering the quite literal pain and suffering they put me through. 171 degrees. Unbelievable. You need to train your staff properly before someone gets seriously hurt! 
Oh and by the way, it is 2 and a half hours later and I still can't enjoy my own dinner before my mouth feels like it had 3rd degree burns in it. Seriously, I can feel shreds of loose skin in my mouth.

"Lifetime is definitely a great gym. This location has a ton of features including a full rock climbing wall (whoa!) and day care centre for your kids. My only gripe is that it still feels overpriced.

It's also funny to see how hard they try to sell memberships. The person who set up mine spent so much time giving me the tour and talking about how great it was and too little time setting up my actual profile into the system. Turns out they put in a wrong email address and name for me the first time, making it impossible for me to access my online profile and receive the newsletters. 

When you go to try to cancel your membership, they tell you that you HAVE to come in person and it HAS to be 30 days notice (not 31, not 29 from what I was told). They also proceed to ask you many questions about why you want to cancel and try to keep you during this process.

"Terrible, horrible service. They couldn't have gotten it more wrong if they tried. I think they've been open now for several weeks.... C'mon guys get it together. I called ahead on the phone. It rang at least 30 times before a meek girl answered. I was driving from Glendale over to the Metro Center and it took the entire drive for her to take the order. By the time I parked my car at the restaurant and walked in, the order still hadn't even been put in. I give them partial credit for trying, as they requested my order to be done on the fly. However, when it came out, it came with an apple. I never ordered an apple. When I asked the gentleman why I was given one, he simply replied, ""Well you either get an apple, a bag of chips, or a roll. And it appears they ordered you an apple."" Ohhh kayyyy, whatever, at this point I was late. However, I had also ordered a cookie. I had to ask and point out 3x that it was not in the bag before he looked for himself and realized it actually was not there, walked me over the counter, and handed me one. I also had to ask about my drink which was also not given to me. As if this was bad enough, when I got to my destination and opened my bag, I discovered I had been given a cold turkey sandwich instead of the warm turkey panini that I ordered. The food was expensive but fairly good provided you can get it ordered timely and correctly.   Anyone want an apple?",0.0

Went to see the Dave Rawlings Machine last night.  The music was terrific but that was all. It is overcrowded and the table placements leave a lot to be desired. We tried to order food were given menus 25 minutes past after we ordered and they came to tell us the kitchen was closed. I took another. Took another 15 minutes to get the wine and water we ordered. The waitress never came back to check on us when it was time to cash out she conveniently kept the change until we asked about it.  The music box sounds like a great idea but it wasn't. Very poor service,0.0
"When you overcharge your Biryani about 20% higher than any other Indian place you should at least include Raita with it and not make your customers have to pay for it separately. Secondly the Biryani that I received was more like Muttar Pulao and  hardly had any chicken in it.. Not going to lie, it did taste good but when I ask for Biryani, I expect Biryani. It's too bad this is the only Indian takeout option near by, cause i'll never be coming back.",0.0
