"Wow! Incredible selection of authentic Indian food as well as a sprinkling of indo-chinese dishes. The staff was friendly, as we're the other patrons. A word of caution, the seating seems to get taken pretty quickly, as it's a popular place. The serving sizes were generous, which makes most of the dishes a great value. The garlic Naan in particular was amazing.",1.0
"I want to HIGHLY recommend the Cleveland Clinic at 3131 La Canada, if you ever find yourself in need of a Urologist.
I have been a patient there for 6 months and Dr. Laurie Larson and Dr. Scott Slavis have both been amazing. In fact the entire staff, reception, nurses, schedulers, techs - EVERYONE has been compassionate, caring, understanding, patient and willing to listen. All the while they have maintained a level of professionalism needed to instill the confidence that I have in them today. 
I have never been left in the waiting room for longer that 10 minutes and just today had to wait for Dr Slavis for only 5 minutes and he actually apologized. Lol
I'm scheduled for surgery on Tuesday and I have no doubt that everything will go well with the experienced, confident Dr. Slavis doing the procedure.",1.0
"I've grown up going to panader√≠as. When my dad brought me to here, I was expecting the usual, but Vegas Bakery is definitely not.

You walk in and it's big and bright. When I went in, around 7 on a Saturday night, there were lots of staff friendly and ready to help. 

What I love is that they have the classic Mexican pan dulce like conchas and cuernos, but there's so much more, too. They add their own twists to classics here and they also have cannolis, cheesecake, red velvet cake and probably any other pastry you want. I was actually almost overwhelmed by all the choices. Nonetheless, they're pan dulce was good and I'll have to try it again when I come back to Vegas.",1.0
"We came with a group of 9 for Sunday brunch and it was great! My favorite part was that they include a beer in their brunch prices!

I ordered the monte cristo which was spectacular. Generous amount of melted Swiss is on top of a pile of ham in between tasty French toast. They have a jam smear on the plate which tasted great with the sandwich (it may have been cranberry but I am not certain). The potatoes were meh, especially when compared to the sandwich.

My husband ordered their chicken and waffles which were also quite good. And that is coming from me, a person who is not crazy for fried chicken. It comes with a small bowl of fresh fruit.

One of my friends ordered the biscuits and gravy which was also surprisingly good. The biscuits were average. The gravy was great with a distinct southwestern flair. Lots of sausage and a nice chili flavor without being too hot.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I are visiting Montreal and we decided to stop in Lindt to search for items that the Lindt USA shops don't carry. I work at a Lindt shop in the states and I was blown away at how well-kept the store was, the friendliness of all of the employees, and their exceptional selection of chocolate. 

The manager, Danielle, was particularly inviting and she went above and beyond to make sure that we found everything we needed. 

I had an amazing experience and will absolutely return if I ever visit Montreal again. :)",1.0
Truly a best kept secret!  I am a fairly picky eater and found the grilled chicken to be very tasty and cooked perfectly.  You will not find chicken cooked to this perfection anywhere in Pittsburgh.  The 2 sides I chose were cabbage and greens.  So scrumptious and vinegary and flavorful!  Nothing was over-salted either.  Where can you go and hear professional jazz music while dining (and at no charge!)  What a fun way to spend a Sunday evening.  The icing on the cake was P.K. walking me out to my car to be sure I was safe.  I will definitely be going back!  Glad to hear that you are expanding!,1.0
"Great poke place, very tasty like the Paina Cafes back home. The poke hits the spot when you're craving for local Hawaiian delights. Owner is very friendly and nice. Definitely will return!

"They came out to fix my backwash handle and the first time I tried to use it it broke off. Literally didn't even last 1 use. When I called to have them replace it they asked me to go back through my warranty company but then I have pay the full $70 fee again. $140 total for a new handle? Both of the girls who handle the ""customer service"" are rude and snarky. I also don't appreciate the snarky and passive aggressive comment on this review from whoever Mike is.  The bottom line is that a handle that is used only once every 90 days or so should last more than 90 days. They didn't even replace the 15 year old handle just the base which is half a$$ and shoddy work. I don't care what the policy of my home warranty is. They should back up their product.  It's not the HW companies fault that they don't take pride in what they do. 

In short: Worthless customer service and worthless service on my pool. Don't bother with this company, I anticipate they'll be out of business within the year anyway. Good riddance.",1.0

"I recently had a large size Keloid that was growing on my face\/cheek. I consulted with Dr. Voci and he thought it was best to remove it and be aggressive with treatment so the chances were better for it not to come back. 
The day of my procedure, I was so nervous and worried but Dr. Voci and his Staff totally put me at ease and treated me like family! 
My procedure was a success and although I am going to need numerous follow ups, I don't mind as long as he is the hands, heart and vision behind the procedures.
I was beginning to lose my confidence and I was starting to feel less than but, since my procedure, I feel Beautiful and I feel like I can talk to people and know that they are paying me attention, not my keloid.

"My favorite part about the hotel was the bed! It was super comfy! I also like that for the price, the rooms are super spacious, with a couch and tiny kitchenette. After that, it's a pretty standard hotel. No special touches or frills. 

I wish the showerhead was better, rather than that puny one that doesn't match or cover the large shower space. Also, the room could have used one more round of the vacuum cleaner too. But other than that, the room was fine. 

The location seemed slightly off the beaten path, but still was walkable from anywhere I needed to be, so I appreciated that. This would be a great option for families, as it's so spacious. I'd probably hop to another hotel next time I'm in Charlotte, but this one is a-okay.",1.0

"Completely incompetent and unprofessional service. I went to Axces law the first week of April to begin a very basic process of incorporating a business. I filled out the forms, and was told that I'd receive a call in less than a week from the lawyer to pick up my incorporation papers. I was told VERY clearly that the process would take a week. After 10 days, I heard nothing from Axces law, so I called and left 2 messages. Someone called me back finally and had me come in again. I was under the impression I'd be picking up the incorporation documents that day. Nope. I had to review the draft which contained an incredible amount of mistakes for a qualified law firm. I drew attention to their mistakes and then was told again by the same incompetent secretary that on Monday (the first business day), they'd e-mail me. Nope. After another week, I left 2 more messages.. Someone called me back and had no idea what I was talking about. I told them ho it's been weeks and I can't move forward in my business without these documents, not to mention that this is that business registration is the most basic process and I could have had it done elsewhere in a week. Finally the initial receptionist I was dealing with called me back and had me come in a third time (Everytime I was driving in there, it was taking me 40 minutes and woul dhave to take time off from work). I told her that I absolutely NEED the papers that day. Once again, it was the same draft copy with nothing edited. Nothing had been done since my prior visit. The last straw was when Axces law promised me this was the last draft copy, and for sure i'd have mypapers ready on Wednseday May 3 (yesterday). I go to the law office, and the lawyer was dressed SO UNPROFESSIONALLY. He was wearing jeans and a tshirt, nothing close to what you'd expect from a professional. He had had completed NOTHING on my business and had not even completed the name search. I spent 4 visits and over a month trying to get this done with Walmart and ended up telling them yesterday I would NOT be paying for these services an cancelled the whole thing. I wasted an entire month with useless back and forth visits, no follow up from the lawyers, constant leaving of messages to get calls back from receptionist, only to literally realize that they had done nothing after over a month. Completely ridiculous and insane. DO NOT GO TO AXCES LAW.",1.0
"I'll never understand ""fast"" food restaurants that don't have enough food prepared at a rush time like dinner time. Why as a customer should I have to wait 15 minutes or accept alternates like smaller pieces or spicy when I want mild unless being encouraged to do so by way of a discount. 

Managers should have a better handle of the flow and be ready. Rant over. Going somewhere else.",1.0
So excited finally an Italian restaurant that's amazing and nearby my home.

We stopped in to grab dinner and chose Noodles as we expected a shorter dining time than a full service restaurant. We ordered four items and were the only diners in the store. It took over 30 minutes to get three noodle bowls and a 6 piece order of bread. Each person's meal came out separately and the bread came out last and after we were well into our meals. No real apology from the staff and excuses for our every concern. They had six visible employees and only one customer (us) to serve in a timely manner. We have plenty of restaurants to support in the community but this shouldn't be one of them.,1.0
"2.5 stars. The lowest I have given.

Came on a Wednesday night with my friend.  My friend has been wanting to try and so there I was with her.
The first impression of the decor reminds me to Mill St. Brewery@ distillery. Understanding it was a week night, there are less people...we waited a few minutes before we were greeted by a hostess...where she came out from? ...no clue! We were seated in the tall booths.  My friend..being a blunt one mumbled, ""out of the wholeee restaurant, they'd pick suck high seats?! They did not even give us any choices! Having been in the food business...I am guessing that they want to seat us where we have enough privacy yet it is within the server's distance.

Food...it took longer for the food to arrive...I was never one to remember names of dishes and so I'll describe it on each photo I post

Service...the server looked tired, she used her cheerful tone to introduce us with specials, a bit about the restaurant...but she kinda went MIA after...

Overall, the concept of the restaurant was great, the idea of the dishes were cool...the execution was just poorly done...but hey, the waffle was cold but tasty",1.0
"Ok, ya' all...I can tell you that this lovely diner is a must!
I really could have given this new place 5 stars.

When me and my husband walked in for lunch, we were greeted right away. And the place was buzzing...It is a breakfast, lunch and dinner all of the time kind if place. The greeting was lovely and the service was exceptional throughout! 
The food coming out of the kitchen looked ridiculously amazing...And, there is a menu, that is crazy looking delicious. 
You may want to check out their fried chicken something (waffles, dinner, etc.). Or The, Hash and\/ eggs benedict. Hash browns are crispy and look super delicious.

So, what happened with us was that my husband ordered the fish and chips. And I Had the specialty Pastrami with egg on top sandwich. (That was an amazing sandwich with fresh baked bread.  However, I think, Metro Diner missed the mark with the Fish and Chips because they used the Suewi fish(sp) instead of a traditional bass or halibut. Maybe catfish.  I had a taste and thought it was too mushy and a bit muddy for this dish!  

However, the manager came by really prompt and was  gracious and personable. 
Otherwise, you bet! Give this place a try.....I think you all would love it! Great Job Metro Diner!

Essence has by far change my view on dealing with dispensaries or delivery services Emerald essense delivery in my opinion has the highest gtade Canibus products are all medical grade and the one thing that comes very appreciated with them is when you order a string if you order OG Kush you're getting OD Kush if you order blueberry you're getting the real blueberry strain you're not getting anything but what you want and what you ordered they have also some of the nicest and most professional staff the last but not least I got to tell you their prices for the quality of their meds is yet to be beat in my opinion by any other dispensary or delivery best bud does prices in town,1.0
"first and last time at the rebel lounge. came for an all ages show. I couldn't step outside in between sets because im not 21, which makes absolutely no sense. I was trying to go out to sit down because there's no seating except in the bar and I didn't want to sit on the floor and get stepped on.

bottom line: don't have an all ages show if you can't provide equal or fair treatment for those under 21.

"Head upstairs at the D for a better bar experience than Long Bar. It's smaller, but the experience at Vue is significantly better. Drinks are cheap, service is friendly, and there are a couple of TVs to watch a game. You'll have to multitask though, because all the seats at the bar have built in gaming. There are a couple of high top tables if that's not your thing.

The biggest draw here is the balcony, with a great view of Fremont Street- you don't even need a drink to enjoy it, and it's just far enough above the chaos observe for entertainment without actually having to interact with the unsavory characters in the area. Good spot to grab a drink before dining on site.",1.0

They had the worst customer service they were very rude to me and my sister and they constantly argued with my decision of what I wanted to buy and I didn't buy it because of the way they spoke to me in a very rude and mean kind of way and I just think it's terrible place because they have terrible customer service and because they treat their hedgehogs in a kind of bad condition because their cage was very dirty and it look like has been cleaned for a week or two and you are supposed to clean it  almost every day very disgusting and unhealthy for the hedgehog and you shouldn't keep hedgehog food out he source in the whole lifetime because they are from the desert that's why if you want to go to store with great customer service and their stores very clean and I would recommend wild side pets they have the best customer service and they treat their animals with love and compassion,1.0
"I realize this is an outlier of a review, but I did reach out to Donut Bar via their website with no response. Overall, these are some good donuts. I had the maple bacon cinnamon roll before we headed off to Death Valley and Northern California. The first few bites were pretty amazing, but things turned when I got closer to the center, which by this time we were in Indian Springs. The girlfriend thought it was a molten center, but it just turned out that the center was COMPLETELY RAW!  I'm not saying this was the contributing factor to some stomach problems I had for the following few days, but exactly rule it out either.

I said booties and she said we don't have those and idk where they ordered them so try Amazon. I can't believe an employee would direct me to another merchant .

"The birthday cake ice cream and cookie butter ice cream are undoubtedly delicious! So creamy, perfectly sweet, and the made-to-order nitrogen-freezing process seems to really make a difference in the consistency. It seems to be thicker and to not melt as fast as other ice creams. 

The bummer is that, as many others have said, it's just so darn expensive. I'm used to pricey ice cream shops (Melt, Churn, Sweet Republic, Fatty Daddy's, Baked Bear, etc, etc), but this place really seems excessive. $1 extra to substitute a different ice cream base, $1 per topping, and on and on, after already paying $4.50 for a single scoop or $8.50 for a double. My husband and I came here last night and spent $18 for the two of us (and I only had a single scoop, regular milk base, with no toppings). Unfortunately, as delicious and fun as the ice cream is, it's hard to feel good about dropping that much money on a two-person ice cream run.

Their rewards program helps out a bit, as I'm 2 points away from a free single scoop. And the rewards program will also give you a free ice cream on your birthday, so that's a really nice treat.

If you can afford a trip here, I recommend it. But I know the high base price and all the crazy upcharges will prevent me from being a frequent visitor here.",1.0

Excellent food and a great atmosphere. I was with a large group and the wait staff was very accommodating. Our waiter was really knowledgeable and helpful.  The tiger shrimp appetizer was our tables favorite of the 3 we tried. I had the mahi mahi as my entree it was cooked perfectly.  My friend had the pork tenderloin and it was easily some of the best I've had.  I got the house margarita and it was well balanced; not too sweet or sour. We tried 3 deserts and the coconut cake was our favorite.  I would definitely come back.,1.0

-Prices a lot more affordable than most other places in Pittsburgh
-Provided a time frame of approximately how long the appointment would take overall and was pretty close to matching the estimated time

"I was really excited to try the Schnitzel Haus but was left disappointed. I was married to a German, have traveled all over Germany, have had German food across the US, so my expectations are high.

We started with the kartoffel pancakes, and they were delayed coming out. The cakes were huge, but oil oozed from them when slicing into them. Served with a small portion of canned applesauce and sour cream. I didn't care to eat more than one.

I ordered the jaeger schnitzel and while the cutlet was moist and had a good crust, it was also oozing oil. The jaeger sauce was bland without any punch. I would've thought the mashed potatoes were flakes until I hit a chunk of potato, so that's good, I suppose. I really love spaetzle and this was not my favorite. It needed to be fried in the pan more (to give a better crunchy texture), or it needed to be drizzled into the water at a smaller density. Instead, you just had large, chewy, flavorless curds. Normally spaetzle is the first thing to leave my plate, but I wasn't interested in finishing.

My wife had the seafood alfredo pasta and it was equally unimpressive. The sauce seemed to be nothing more than cream and a bit of parmesan and was one-note (I know, alfredo isn't much more than that, but this was pretty uninteresting). The shrimp was overcooked and the ""krab"" was imitation...so both items were rubbery. 

I just got the sense that perhaps the food has been ""Americanized"" to fit the midwest palate.",1.0
"Your experience of course depends on the event you're attending and your fellow attendees. However I attended the Atlantic-10 tournament and had a great time.

"I have a lot of respect for details. I would argue that details leave a indelible impression: always. 

From the feel of the silverware to the lightly dusted tortilla chips make this place a favorite. It is not ordinary. 

I was very impressed by the child pepper type spices dusted on the chips.  The salsa was unique as well.  There was the traditional 'smoky"" flavor but then there was something with just a hint of lightness or sweetness.  Although, I don't know that sweetness is the correct adjective. 

I enjoyed my brisket enchilada but felt that the brisket was a bit bland for an enchilada.  However, the meat was tender and was still tasty.  I had a bite of carne asada and would recommend that meat if you are looking for a more traditional flavor.  Also, there was not  enough enchilada sauce on my enchilada.  I know this is a pet peeve of mine but I feel it is important.  There is a right balance for the sauce and I just don't feel it was met. 

The guacamole was very yummy. It tasted fresher than another very high profile Mexican restaurant I know, but there was a more dominant lime flavor that was very agreeable.  

The flan was truly a surprise.  It was textured (see picture) and the carmelized sugar was slightly burnt as is traditional in a flan.  It tasted great.  If you like the traditional smooth texture it might not be for you.  However, the carmelized sugar was very delicious and the flan itself tasted like a flan should.

We waited nearly an hour. Once we got in we were encountered with more long lines waiting at each sampling table. Tables were set up in walk ways so you couldn't even get thru. You couldn't tell who was in line and who wasn't. They claimed there were free finger foods but I only saw 1 guy for about 39 seconds with a small tray what looked like spinach quiche. We waited in more lines than we actually got to taste them. Many tables ran out of product...which is unacceptable. Maybe next year they will learn from their mistakes.

On a sorti le tapis rouge, on passe √† travers les portes colossales de la banque, on descend plusieurs escaliers, tout semble myst√©rieux et intrigant. On entend la musique plus loin, il ne reste qu'√† longer un passage masqu√© par de lourds rideaux sombres. Puis on arrive dans une bo√Æte de nuit magnifique, tout √† √©t√© pens√©, organis√© pour taper l'≈ìil, des jeux de graphisme sur les murs ou on peut voir des gargouilles bouger. Il y a deux salles, l'une pour la musique hip hop et l'autre salle principale pour le house-electro-dance... 
au d√©but la musique n'√©tait pas terrible puis ca s'est am√©lior√© et l'ambiance √©tait g√©niale au fil que les heures passaient. Toutefois pour un club qui se dit s√©lect et voulait du beau monde il y a avait franchement n'importe qui qui pouvait rentrer: en baskets, en shorts, en flip flop, tres d√©cevant pour ceux qui font l'effort de se mettre sur leur 31 ! Prix des drinks allant avec l'√©tablissement attendez vous √† payer au minimum 8$ la bi√®re et √† partir de 11$ les cocktails et ils peuvent aller jusqu'√† 20$ selon l'alcool s√©lectionn√©. Fun assur√© je ne regrette pas mon passage et y retournerait avec plaisir !!",1.0

"Hands down one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants I have been to her in Charlotte. I've came here a handful of times and every time has been great. The service is fast and the sushi is fresh. If you're not familiar with Mr. Tokyo it's an AYCE hibachi and sushi restaurant. I can't vouch for the hibachi as I've never had it, but their sushi is pretty bomb. And the best part is that it's NOT a buffet. The sushi is made fresh and made to order. And for $18 a person for dinner you really can't beat it.

For starters I always get a spring roll and the Mr. Tokyo bowl, which is limited one per person. The Mr. Tokya bowl is spicy crab goodness wrapped in salmon and it's dynamite! It's a must order every time. 

My husband and I usually split 5 speciality rolls (woof I know) here and our favorites are the Panther roll (which I didn't see on the menu last time- sadness) and the Snow White roll. The Sweet Heat roll is also a personal favorite with avocado and spicy tuna. 

Since the release of the Charlotte Agenda article on this place they have been packed so make sure you come ready to wait on the weekends. However, their bar (sits 4) is open on a first come- first served basis. We sat up there once and it was fine- better than waiting an hour.",1.0
"We found this little gem while walking around Fremont Street. It's an Irish themed pub\/restaurant. My boyfriend and I were thrown off when we first entered because we were not aware that we were supposed to seat ourselves where ever we would like. Luckily, a waitress came out from the back after a minute and let us know. Our server was very friendly and although she seemed to be in the weeds, you were not able to tell. I had the pretzel burger with fries and my partner had the shepherd's pie, which came with vegetables. The food was delicious. My boyfriend's entree was so large he didn't have room for the vegetables! The only complaint I have was that our waitress did not refill our sodas and it took her a long time to retrieve our check after we put our credit card in the check book. This can be overlooked because she was so friendly and we understood that she had a lot of tables to take care of. We will be back!",1.0
"Great customer service here. This staff was so friendly to me. I'm not big in the whole cosmetic type stuff so their help was so appreciate.

The woman I wish I got names :( helped me and my partner a lot. He wanted a good blemish mask and she did it on his hand for him to see how it feels. He wasn't ready to make the commitment but she went out of her way to make him a mini sample to take home and use, that was really awesome.

Great prices here especially at the Forum Shops. I spent about $24 on a scalp detox bar and a cinnamon massage bar. Not too bad for both.

I would come back to this one because it wasn't overly crowded and the staff didn't make me feel stupid when I didn't know much about this stuff!!",1.0
"Dumpster Diver is a convicted criminal & Rita (office manager) covers up EVERYTHING!
*Look at the pictures above to see who I'm talking about*

""Dumpster Diver"" is doing everything she's NOT suppose to be while living in Section 8 housing, and Rita is always lying when neighbors complain. 
Rita doesn't respond to calls & actually visits this woman daily DURING work hours for coffee. They sit & gossip about other tenants & Rita has even used racial slurs while referring to other residents. Dumpster Diver even has a criminal record, but fails to report it to Section 8 housing.
""Dumpster Diver"" assaulted two people while they were inside of the Villanova office a few years ago. She slapped, punched, scratched & ripped the shirts off the victims while the office watched. When the police arrived this pathological liar accused the victims of hitting her and the STAFF LIED TO THE POLICE. The office said this lady was the victim. When the police went through the office cameras, ""Dumpster Diver"" was arrested for her criminal charges. THIS IS THE TYPE OF CORRUPTION THAT'S GOING ON AT VILLANOVA APARTMENTS THAT NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT.

This lady also RENTS out her 2nd bedroom for cash, picks up cans\/bottles for extra income, babysits for neighbors for extra income & sells her (Medicaid funded) prescription medication for $250 a BOTTLE. This woman constantly gets free lock changes (thanks to her multiple renters), people are constantly going in\/out of her apartment & I've even seen the police at her place twice this last month. Dumpster Diver is a gambling addict & even gets rides from maintenance guys to the SouthPoint DURING work hours. She actually has a renter living with her right now; they've been there for 4 months.

This elderly woman is planning to rent out her WHOLE apartment in 2018, while she visits back\/fourth between her homeland.Her daughter is going to collect the rent money AND the drug money while her Communist, Anti-American mother lives overseas. 
I see tons of homeless people in my hometown, but this conniving lady gets everything for free while partaking in illicit activities? This lady has even laughed about poisoning a family's dog with bug spray, while babysitting at this complex. Rita knows EVERYTHING, and still doesn't do anything??? Why is Rita not doing her job?This woman plays the grandma card daily, and all Rita does is look the other way. 
This favoritism, discrimination and dishonesty at Villa Nova Apartments needs to end.

I've contacted  Brenda Fonseca, Amparo Gamazo and Michelle Hoffeman over this issue. If any of you have issues while living at Villanova, skip Rita & go straight to these 3 supervisors at Southern NV Housing Authority. This place is full of lazy workers with nasty attitudes who rather gossip than keep the community safe. Maintenance has even stolen jewelry from clueless residents! Random things will go missing from your patio, people leave their trash everywhere & bugs are very common at Villanova.  Go rent somewhere else if you want a real professional management team.",1.0
I absolutely love this place!!! I'm a huge fan of naked fish! I came in and ordered the pork belly skewer along with a few others... Amazing the got some sashimi and age dashi tofu and Michu along with chawan mushi all were so good!! They have Hibiki 12 or Nikka 12 for $8 too... I usually sit at the counter and drink with the owner... this place is a must!,1.0
"Ordered twice, received food once. 

Yamato is close to my continuing ed classes in Penn Center. Tax writeoff + hot hibachi meal = amazing. Right? 

Wrong.

First order of chicken teriyaki with vegetables came with onions. Just onions. I choked it down but just assumed they'd run out of real vegetables. No big deal.

Second order a week later, I cite in the comments ""no onions please. broccoli carrots mushrooms squash bell pepper snap peas zucchini all acceptable""

Patiently waiting for my food - I notice how empty the place is. Yikes. All the other hibachi style restaurants are at least 70% full on the weekdays.

The manager informs me there will be an extra charge. Um, okay, why? ""Chicken Teriyaki only includes onions."" My response ""Well, the definition includes certain vegetables. If you don't include some of the, it's not chicken teriyaki. It's just chicken with noodles, which doesn't sound appetizing.

Very sad, he began raising his voice. 20 minutes after I ordered, the food was still not ready. 

Waste of my time. Disappointed -- as the daughter of immigrants, I love to frequent and reward immigrant owned businesses.

"I come here most of the times during lunch as this place is near to my home and also to my work. They got very good lunch specials on their menu and the food is very authentic thai. Best thing here is their choice of spice levels , which i need to mention this because most of the places add some extra peppers or spices on top of the dish when prepared but this place i see they maintain the spice levels by the Thai chilies which is very authentic . 

This place is a small tucked away looks like but they had good taste of maintaining their interiors with some decorative traditional Thai crowns. Also the staff here are very warm and prompt at their service . I recommend this place to my fellow yelpers to give a try.",1.0
"Just got done eating a grilled cheese sandwich, Hawaiian Maui onion chips and a handsens root beer from these guys. Total was $9 even.

I am a student at UNLV and I frequently get bored with the options in the student union so I decided to try out the food trucks. SO glad I did. 

The grilled cheese is made with 3 delicious cheeses and is VERY cheesy. (Nothing worse than a low cheese grilled cheese) for $3 more you can make it a meal with chips and a drink so I did that. 

The Hansens soda is what I like to call the guilt free soda because there is no artificial colors or flavors, no sodium, and no caffeine. 

The young blonde girl who took my order was very sweet and patient with me ummmmmming my way through the menu and asking her for recommendations. 10\/10 would recommend, after reading these reviews I think I'll try the pesto next time!",1.0

"I enjoy coming to Pinks several times a year. I love that they use Polish weenies. If you order a specialty dog they are quite large. It could easily fill you up. I also love their chili cheese fries delux style (includes onions, tomato, and sour cream). There is only outdoor seating so if it is summer it will be uncomfortable. Also, I am a Coca Cola lover and they only sell Pepsi products. Aside from that I enjoy coming here. The seating faces the strip so you get a view of the Aria hotel and you get to people watch. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the price is a little high. I paid $32 for two specialty dogs, delux chili cheese fries (which is small), and 2 drinks. I do recommend trying this place out at least once.",1.0
"I called Lisa for a Brazilian Blowout. My hair is extremely thick, coarse, and frizzy. It turned out awesome! I couldn't be happier! I used the Brazilian Blowout shampoo and conditioner to maintain my Brazilian Blowout.

Lisa listened and addressed all the concerns that I had. I couldn't recommend this salon more to those who are thinking about checking it out.",1.0

You want to experience the old and the original Las Vegas strip - this is it. There's so many vendors and so many street acts to see. They have several live band shows. There's a zip line along with a fly like Superman zip! There's also a light show walking on Fremont street. This place is definitely not for children!,1.0
"Tasty, super fast and super affordable. Feel like we found a hidden treasure.  Staff was very friendly and we got a 12-inch(ish? I forgot to ask\/measure) margherita for 8.95 in 3 minutes.  They do custom pizzas from scratch, and the dessert option sounds awesome.  Inside is clean and bright.  

Perfect for late night \/ post-bar snacking.  Also perfect for anyone who likes pizza at amazing prices.  Is it the best pizza in Cleveland?  Nah.  But EASILY the best at this price.  I would go again in a heartbeat.",1.0
"I had the BEST experience here with Emily! It was my first time visiting this nail salon and true to the many reviews written, it was an absolutely pleasure. I have been to many nail salons, both uptown and downtown, and Nails on Yonge is definitely my new go-to. Emily was receptive to my needs while being extremely efficient. I read a couple of reviews here about the place being dirty which is simply not true. It is a little crowded right now but I'm sure when they're new store is completely renovated that there will be more space. As well, in terms of hygiene, I was impressed with how Emily used a brand new buffer(?) or nail filer for myself and all the customers who came in!

If I'm coming in to a shop like this to buy my spring\/summer wardrobe and pay $500+ to do so, I would appreciate being able to ask a question without be berated or made to feel small. This place is all about customer-dis-service. I will continue to do my shopping online for JJill apparel and will not trouble this staff with my business.",1.0
"Kaiser did a great job from beginning to end. They were responsive to my calls and emails. Their price and service were all reasonable and we are very happy with the final product. Our installation was a little atypical and Kary made sure we knew exactly what needed to be done to prepare our carport for a new garage door. They knew our timeline and made sure that we got the door ordered in-time, and they kept all of their promises. I would definitely use them again.",1.0
"I walked in and immediately asked how much a gel manicure would be, the gentleman informed me $25.00. I had my nails done and when I went to pay, my nail tech told me $35. I got a basic gel manicure.

"This is my go to Korean restaurant!

FOOD: The combination is the best way to experience their food. It comes with various meats and side dishes. Their brisket is my favorite meat. It is served with cheese and sushi rice. Any meat that you chose is slice fresh to order. Their meat is the quality you can get in Vegas. The cheese corn is great additional to any meal. It is both sweet and cheesy!

DRINK: They have a variety of beer, sake and wine. It goes very well with the Korean bbq.

DESSERT: Their rice cake ice cream dessert is amazing! Mango is my favorite:)

ATMOSPHERE: Nana is super nice! From the staff to the decor to the music, this restaurant creates a true Korean setting. Everyone is super nice and diligent. In the restrooms they even have mouthwash, toothbrushes, and toothpaste for you!",1.0
"This was my first (of hopefully many) visits to the Belmont Famous Toastery. We'd been to the Charlotte locations before, so we were excited about Belmont getting one. 

I worried about going on the opening weekend, especially with a hungry four year old who gets hangry sometimes, but getting there early guaranteed no wait. There were plenty of super friendly staff waiting to help us, and the neat thing about FT is that every server is your server. So we had our order placed, drinks out, and food on our table in literally no time.

 The French toast was light with a bit of crisp, the bacon was thick, and scrambled eggs were fluffy. I peaked someone's breakfast burrito from a few tables over and that's what I'll try next. That thing looked thick, just like I like em. 

I'll be back soon. You should go too. Everyone in Belmont needs the Famous Toastery in their life.",1.0

In more detail: tried the cookies and cream shake with tapioca pearls and it was SOO good. It's a big dessert, but not overly sugary. It works well. 

I also tried cupcakes that were very much homemade and I enjoyed that, too. The frosting on red velvet was buttercream and not cream cheese, but that's not a huge deal since it was all so good. 

I tried the classic milk tea with boba and the flavour was just right. Refreshing, not too sweet. 

The espresso was also well made and I enjoyed the Americano along with everything else I sampled. 

I look forward to trying them again when they've had some more time to percolate in the area.",1.0
"The sushi here has the most variety and seems to be the freshest out of all of the Ichiban locations.

I would say to not go here for the teppanyaki as portions can vary, but it's not bad quality either, maybe it's just not my thing. 

I find that the board has something different every time I come here, which is awesome! I enjoy trying the new specials they have. The other locations keep their specials up for about a year or so, which gets old after awhile.

The tuna here is the best in the city, especially the way that they prepare spicy tuna, it is godlike. 

Above all, the prices for special rolls here are comparable to the waterworks location, and aren't ridiculous like the wexford one. Taking a star off only because sometimes the rolls end up being kinda small, but that might be just me.",1.0
I got the green tea and Matcha milk I believe is the name with the less sweet option. But then I decided to make it sweeter by adding Oreos. I also opted in for the Boba to make this tea blast off into flavor. The check in here gets you one free topping so make sure and smash that check in button when you come into this place. Parking sucks here as there are about 29 stores feeding into this parking lot. But well worth the inconvenience. Super friendly folks at the counter as well!,1.0

I know this is a Days Inn and not a Marriott, but I think making sure the shower works and the a\/c (in Arizona) is user friendly is very standard. Unless this is the only hotel and it's 120 degrees outside making it impossible to sleep in your car I would not recommend this to anyone.",1.0
"Rating - 1.0\/5.0

Sorry but this ain't good. Definitely overhyped and am hoping the one in Japan is not like this. I decided to check this place out a couple weeks ago as there wasn't really a lineup. The wait was around 15 minutes at around 8-9 pm.

We tried the original cheesecake tart. For something that has received so much praise and anticipation, it was truly a disappointing experience.  The texture was runny and lacked any depth in cheese flavour. The crust was also bland. 

We tried eating it fresh as well as after leaving it in the fridge the next day - which was even worse. It was like eating a soggy cardboard with some eggy pudding.

There's a good variety of different traditional Korean dishes and appetizers on this menu. It gives you options for sauces and sides also. 

I just love the Korean red bean dip and they make a great version. We tried almost everything in the menu (but, be careful, it says that if you over order that you will be charged a la carte prices.) Alright I had no problem finishing everything because it was so good and rich in flavor. My taste buds were going wild with the strong and hearty taste that they have in each of the dishes. 

There's a dish called ""The Shit"" and it is...'the shit'! It's got a great side sauce to go with it and just like the menu suggests, it is a ""must try."" The other ""must try"" was a rice shaker and it's basically a bibimbap. It was great but not what I'm used to bibimbap being because it was in a different container and was loose but the ingredients were the same. So it's like bibimbap but a 'shaker' because it was shaken up in the container.

Everything was really worth trying at least once and some items I ordered twice.

So, we only ordered 2 small plates from DOCG ( both were delicious- meatballs and eggplant parmigiana) and decided to check out what the black hole next door was all about.

"The WORST company I have ever dealt with. 

TDS only wants your money. Me and my family have been paying for their phone and internet service for many years now. Despite the bills increasing, the service continues to worsen. 

Last year sometime in November\/December our speeds were reduced by half. I then realized that TDS Telecom had been selling to more customers in our area even with the lines being congested. This is bad business practice. But they are a monopoly in this area. On one occasion upon calling customer service I was being threatened to end our contract with TDS Telecom because they felt I was being ""too concerned"" with why the internet service was getting slower. That's a great way to anger customers. 

We are paying over $80 a month for internet and it is slower now than it's ever been. After running several Speedtests I can conclude that we will probably never get the speeds we used to. Doing online work and paying bills is becoming a complete chore due to poor service. TDS couldn't care less for their customers.

I had the fried chicken with brussel sprouts. I am a bit obsessed with fried chicken and found this skin to be nice and crispy, but the chicken itself was on the drier side. Wings ordered for the table proved to be a better choice- breaded, fried but less cooked through and slathered in hot sauce. I think we all found ourselves quite jealous of the friend that ordered the fish and chips. The huge piece of haddock had the most inviting batter of all, and the thick-cut fries were perfectly crispy on the outside with seemingly mashed potato insides. Not finished! His meal also came with two dipping sauces. Lucky duck. 

Our waiter was a sweetheart, but things worked against him a little bit. They were sold out of  three of their specialty beers. We order grilled lemon was ordered as an extra but that had to be reminded- not a big deal- and it was quickly brought out. Someone in the group ordered a last pint, but it never did come and it didn't make the bill. We would have needed to order and pay for another one separately, and wanting to get to the show on time it wasn't really possible for us to wait longer. Less beer for us, less $$$ on the bill - not desirable for either sides!

"Tried their chicken parm sandwich. After growing up in the NY, NJ area I was really itching for some authentic no fuss no muss Italian. This place does not disappoint. It itched every spot I had for home. The red sauce is so delicious. I am going to have to make this a go to spot for a quick dinner to go. I heard someone raving about the meatballs. Will write an update as I try more. Don't let the authentic minimal storefront fool you. This place is it.",1.0
"Ok I've seen this in my home town of Tampa, but here in Vegas, it was even funnier. 

The theater was small and intimate so all the seating was good. The actors interacted with the crowd a bit and that just made it even MORE funny.  I absolutely loved the actor playing the role of Christian (4\/19\/17) A more to love Asian male who could really belt one out. In his signature song ""I don't make Love, I F*CK!"", you could tell he was REALLY feeling the part. And he let the audience know it. 

The Ana was mousey and adorable, but the three housewives really sold the show. My personal favorite was the bluesy singer, she brought the house down while singing ""All 50 shades"". That was a real show stopper of a number and I swear she really carried the whole song.

First, I LOVE the sign at the front banning vaping. AWESOME! Every bar need this, I don't want to smell that nasty cotton-candy-meets-asshole oil vapor stench indoors. 

This place is huge, near grocery store sized. Tons of pool tables, about 10 soft tip dart boards and half a dozen steel tip boards. Shuffleboard table, a sweet vintage Lethal Weapon 3 pinball table and lots of mismatched, but comfy, seating. 

Mid-afternoon isn't too busy, so perfect place to stop in for a few games after work. Picks up considerably after 7pm. 

Service has been good. Girls behind the bar are friendly, attentive and efficient. Waitresses start up in the evening and table service is pretty attentive, too. Good staff here. 

Drink prices are reasonable. $6 Rolling Rock pitchers kick ass, and having every Red Bull color under the sun is awesome. Food is typical low-end bar deep-fryer fare, and is a bit pricey for what it is. Meh. Frys are decent, though. 

Two gripes; 1) some of the regulars can be a bit territorial, but that's kind of par for the course. Makes the people watching more interesting, I suppose and 2) either their beer lines need a clean, or their cooler is stinky, because every drink or beer has an odd odor from either the glass or the liquid.

Polite, timely service from our waiter. During the lunch hours, you can get a half of any of their sandwiches and a bowl of soup for $15 Canadian. I ordered their grilled chicken, corn, roasted red pepper sammie (forget the name) and their gazpacho soup. My mother got the roasted veggie and fresh Camembert cheese sandwich, also with their gazpacho. 

BOTH meals were really good! And very filling!! Sandwiches were hot and fresh right out of the kitchen. The cold Gazpacho was creamy and full of flavor. The quality olive oil drizzle on top was a delight. Lots of chicken in mine. Light on the sauce, so nothing was drowned out. The huge strips of roasted veggies on my mother's sammie were sooo flavorful. I feel like Camembert is not used enough, and I was super glad to get a bite :))",1.0

"With several movie theaters in the area, this is not our go to theater. It is convent when times are right for the movie we want to see or when we have a gift card or pre-paid tickets. That being said, it's an okay deal. I feel that if you're going to open both sides of the theater as an entrance, you should have a ticket kiosk at both ends and not just the front that doesn't have the parking lot entrance. If you're worried about keeping an eye on the kiosk, then put them by the service desk in the middle of the lobby. The bathrooms are always dirty no matter what time of the day or week you go. The cleaning staff needs to be priority. It's a busy theater. They have a huge concession stand in the middle of the lobby but only one side is open. The lines are long and frustrating when you are trying to handling little ones. At times it's too much to deal with so we don't bother with concession stand, we go to dinner after the movies. They are losing a lot of business, even with the long lines, more are opting not to bother. I know of many who have taken their own food into the theater. 
They have made the ticket purchase online a little more convent, however you don't have to stand in line at the kiosk or wait for a teller, we now purchase on fandango, print and take them with us to the theater and by pass that horrid line all together. They also offer for $5 more a ticket reserved seating. I like the fact that you aren't fighting the crowed on a popular movie night. On a popular movie opening get there an hour early, we made a mistake and ended up at the end of a very long line waiting to get into the theater itself and sat in front on top of the screen. Reserve seats would have been a good idea for that night. People are rude and pushy on those nights, so we now wait for the second or third night of a new opening. 
I can't comment on the restaurant bar area upstairs of the theater, I have never been. I know family members who have gone before the movies and said they did enjoy it, however it is very pricey, even for a expected movie theater price. 
The theater is in a great location with plenty of free parking. It's a good theater if you can see past all the negative and make a plan before you go.",1.0

"In response to the company's statement

 ""Our Lease application clearly states that that an applicant will be denied for an apartment\/landlord collection.""

Yes that is exactly why we applied because there is no outstanding debt or collection and the agency (Yardi) you use is the one who told us they are not regularly up to date so you will need to take that up with them or find a legitimate service to use. 

""After the regularly updated records were confirmed, proof that the collection was paid could have been submitted for reconsideration. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we have received this.""

A friendly, but non-aggressive salesman saw me walk in, introduced himself, told me where the entertainment centers were and said he'd check on me in 10 minutes. Sure enough he was back in about 10 minutes and patiently answered my questions. I ended up purchasing a floor model for a discounted price and it was delivered three days later.  The delivery was fine and the the three friendly delivery guys got the entertainment center positioned and set up.

"We contacted Mr. Appliance to repair a GE refrigerator that we have in our rental property.  They were very professional and explained that they charge a $79.95 trip\/diagnostic fee.  They also stated that if we chose to have them repair the appliance then the trip fee would be waived and that the repair would be warrantied for 1 year.  They arrived on time and the technician was punctual and  professional.  I later received a call that the part (liner) was not available and they could not repair the fridge however, they still charged for the trip fee.  When I asked if the part was to be located other than in their data base if they would replace it.  They stated that they would in that case not provide the 1 year warranty because there are a lot of things that could go wrong when replacing the liner.  Bottom line, is they did not disclose that if they did not have parts or if they were not available through their data base that they would still charge the trip fee and also even if the part was located they wold not provide the 1 year warranty that they promised.  I would not refer anyone to this business knowing that the expectations and promises are not met or kept.  When I asked to waive the fee, they stated that they could not and that it was standard.

"This place is a pretty decent German restaurant.  The food is fairly true to what German food is.  It has some items that are more of a cross breed of American\/Wisconsin and German.  One of these are the Brat Stickers, think potstickers for Wisconsinites.  They also have some family style specials that sounded great.  All you can eat at a decent price is always nice.

They really have a good selection of German beers on tap, which is much better than the bottled versions you can find that have that aged funk to them.  I sampled a fee and was very happy.  With Madison becoming such a hot spot for craft beer and tap houses, the quality of beer was very welcome.

I did have an issue with their billing though.  I had ordered a 17oz beer and the server told me that the keg was tapped.  They were only able to offer me a partial pour, but she confirmed that the amount would be reflected in the price.  The beer was $4.25 for 17oz.  I was given an 8oz glass that was barely half full.  The charge was $3.75.  So they discounted it $0.50 for only receiving about 1\/3 of a full glass.

"Ok, so just a quick update on a recent food binge we had here. Came for the lechon kawali, which is the deep fried pork belly and for $17, the serving shrunk to a point of non existence resulting to losing our appetites. Really??! It was ridiculously small in comparison to a slab of fresh pork belly you can purchase from the grocery store (which I'm sure they can get way cheaper in bulk from Chinese suppliers).

I'd price it at $12 the most based on portion, these are boiled to tenderness and then deep fried until crispy. Pretty simple process, especially with an expensive pressure cooker to cut some corners.

Not many ingredients is used to put 'fancy gold flakes' pricing on it. It clearly states on the menu that the lechon kawali is priced based on current per pound pricing but I can get a slab of fresh pork belly for the $17!!

When they came out they were packed with some punch that's for sure! When it came to our food it was a different story.. now granted I know our party size was considered large but the time frame we had to wait for it was a bit excessive especially due to the fact that nobody was even in the place when we first arrived. Once food started coming out we had a ton of wrong orders and missing items you name it. 

Nobody ordered anything that could've been labeled as difficult so we weren't too sure how the hiccups in the kitchen were even happening.

We tried the chicken and the pork.  I wanted to try it but it was gone!!! My hubby ate both of them.  The pizza was great. Another thing that I was pleased with was the customer service.  Just an over the counter type of place but he took the time to explain that a lot of their products are imported internationally.  I can tell they are passionate about what they do and really try to put a good product out. I can definitely appreciate it when shop owners really put their best foot forward.

"First time here last night. I prefer the Galaxy in Green Valley. The Cannery is a drive out for me, but my nephew who is visiting wanted to see ""Moana"" and Green Valley wasn't showing it last night.  He's never been to a luxury theater either so I bought our tickets in advance and chose our seats. We were 5 minutes into previews due to traffic. Our reserved seats were filled!  No one could or would do anything from that point and so we just found seats that were left so we wouldn't miss the movie. No ushers were around either. I'd expect one around. Thankfully we didn't sit too close to the screen. But it wasn't the seats I reserved.

6:50pm, Check-in was efficient, no line, but there isn't much direction as to where to go once you enter. Maybe because the Christmas tree was in the way?

Simple adjustments to where things are placed can make a huge difference with flow and efficiency. Or perhaps the ushers should be more interactive and vocal as greeters to extend customer service. Am I asking for too much? Not really. Customer service in general nowadays seem null. It's sad. What ever happened to Service with a smile? Anyway?  I noticed a customer service desk while in line at the ticket counter and happened to turn around to figure out where the theaters actually were. Not exactly sure what that's for...

"Well like most of all the reviews say you have to wait a long time in this location, as if they don't know that they have a rush every single day, which makes sense to make a lot of pizzas right? Anyways I normally go to this place because it's close to home but this time the wait was terrible and then when my order was called I was so happy that I just got my box and walked out, low and  behold while I was in my car waiting in traffic I noticed that my pizza box was smashed in one corner and I had a huge rip in it as well, then I noticed that it had breadcrumbs as if like breadcrumbs from chicken was all over it, I did not feel happy about it, and I did not have time to turn around and go back in and with the sad faces that were working there, so I did report this to the little Caesars listens.com website and took pictures, look at these pictures what would they say if you brought home a pizza box like this to your kids, what would your spouse say, they will think that I beat up this box on purpose, but really it came literally from the pizza maker, to the server, to the cashier, REALLY? It exchange three hands before it got to me and not one of them had the audacity to switch out the box or even apologize for that matter, this is the last time I go in this hot humid store and look at the sad faces there, I'm going to Pizza Hut or dominoes because they always deliver on time and always happy to see me and greet me, my business is going elsewhere!

"We went here for brunch recently and the food was pretty bad... I ordered Smoked Salmon Benedict and it was awful.  First of all, the english muffins at the base of the dish were not even toasted.  The were maybe microwaved at some point which made them soggy and chewy.  The salmon was not smoked salmon as described but rather some bland poached salmon. When the dish arrived it was ice cold and the hollandaise sauce was congealed. The potatoes that accompanied the dish were greasy and the fruit consisted of a few berries that I suspect were not fresh but rather frozen and then thawed.  My husband ordered a breakfast burrito and it was also not very good. It was dried out and also arrived cold.  It was not served with any kind of condiments (i.e salsa, guac, sour cream) and when he inquired about getting some salsa or pico, they said they didn't have any (which I found hard to believe.)  Another person at our table was brought his dish without the accompanying potatoes because they said they had run out of them and explained they would bring them out to him shortly.  They finally brought them out to him as we were getting our bill and they were cold and greasy.

"My teenager had a doctor appointment mid-week and to spend some quality time I let him pick lunch instead of another middle school hot lunch.  Their lunch special is 9.99.  For that you get your choice of rice and then get to mix your own specialty mix of the grill choices.  If you are new there are recipe cards you can follow, or do like I do and wing it.  Grab a bowl and you get to choose between multiple meats, noodles and vegetables to create the dish you want.  You can do all meat with a few random peppers like my son's round one, or a mixture like most are.  Then you choose your sauce.  Each sauce is labeled and also categorized by temperature.  I'm not a spice fan, so I stay to the left.  Round two of the boy's was a bit too far to the right so I got to laugh while he chugged his peach Diet Mellow Yellow.  Then you give your bowl to the grill person who heats it and if you're lucky does a fun little show with his or her grilling utensils.

"I guess you can call me paranoid. I must have searched and read everything there was to read about shoulder ortho's all over Arizona. My situation was different than most I suspect, because not only did my left shoulder have a torn labrum, but it was a result of a violent seizure years ago that causes a full dislocation which causes more complications making a surgery more difficult. 

I had already had 1 failed bankart repair for my left shoulder done in CA 2 years ago. Now that I moved to Scottsdale, I needed to get it fixed and get myself back to normal, which for me, means back to heavy weights at the gym. 

I first met Dr. E in April of this year, (whom I was referred to by a major pain clinic in Scottsdale. I noticed he was right to the point, more technical than emotional - still very caring. In my 37 years I've seen all kinds of Dr's, and so any misgivings others have on here about his bedside manner, (which was good enough), I just can't relate. But I'll tell you, I'd much prefer a technical no nonsense pro, with the confidence \/ experience to take on a surgery like this, as I discovered other orthos here in Scottsdale, will not.

I actually was referred to 2 different doctors prior to being referred to Dr. E. Interestingly enough. The first Ortho I found off yelp here in Scottsdale ( has 18 or so reviews)  told me he didn't feel comfortable doing the surgery, and get this - shoulders were his specialty. He actually said I should return to CA to have the original operating doc redo the procedure. That was not practical for me. Of course, I take nothing away from that doctor, but clearly I had a complicated situation in my shoulder and he didn't feel comfortable after it already had one failed previous bankart repair. So, in a way, he saved me the risk of another failed surgery.

The second option was a pain Dr who suggested shots in each shoulder which cost me $2k and did nothing at all. That pain Dr. who administered the injections recommended Dr E after we decided the injections didn't work. He gave Dr. E raving reviews with specifics for why he believed Dr. E was the way to go hands down, and best in the valley. 

So I made an appt, and was able to get in quickly which I later learned is common. So nice to be able to have good access to Dr. E. Each time I went to his office pre \/ post op, I rarely ever waited long, and I personally appreciate that. 

In my 1st visit he knew instantly I needed surgery. He also discovered something that BOTH previous orthos didn't- which was that my bicep tendon was disconnected and needed to be reattached. 1 week after my 1st visit, surgery was scheduled for the week after, (May 1st 2017)  at which time he fixed a SLAP tear and a bicep tendonesis.

Post op, Dr E said the op was a success and I'll tell you, in 6 weeks, it actually felt for the first time, connected to my body. I'd forgotten what that felt like and that's when I knew, it was working, getting a little better each day. I was amazed. So grateful. But understanding how much it needs to be babied for six months wasn't something I fully contemplated. As such, I came to understand the shoulder is such a mobile joint that its quite common for patients to think they have re-injured it doing things they didn't think would be a big deal. 

Post op, during the 2nd month, and 4th month out, I thought for sure I re-injured it holding a plate of food, and again months later when I tripped and fell. I was freaked out, scared that Id lose all the progress I'd made, so each time, I made an appt. with Dr. E to get an MRI. Funny thing is, he was able to determine from moving my shoulder and doing various physical tests, whether or not an MRI was needed, or if I should just give it more time to heal, as it could be tendonisis, bursitis or scar tissue. 

I was surprised to hear him validate that the recent clicking and popping from the new suspected re-injury was likely from newly formed scar tissue. I thought for sure it was something disconnected or loose. I actually met with him this morning (9\/28\/17 to see if he thought I had re-injured it, and he didn't think from the tests he did, that it was damaged or bad enough to need an MRI, but did suggest that taking 2 months off from PT (which he said I did enough of) and seeing if it felt better, was the best solution. Keep in mind, I was willing to pay for an MRI. But he suggested to give it two months, confirming a genuine bedside manner that really counts, which was saving me money and affirming that my own thoughts are my own worst enemy. 

Btw - in no small measure of appreciation, I  can't write this and not mention his super smart and super cool staff. They go beyond. Amanda,Tracy, Jess and Pam, (in no order) are so accommodating, patient and just kind, in spite of being so busy! They're an amazing team and I'm so glad they're in AZ.

"Gah, I so wanted to fall in love with Futo Buta. Having eaten various regional styles of ramen in Japan I was so excited about its potential. It took me ages to finally try it, nervous this place, like many other asian spots in Charlotte before it, would let me down. Unfortunately it did just that. So I gave it another chance, ordering other things, still....nah. 
  Tonkotsu ramen when done right is one of the best foods out there. Hot, rich, creamy, meaty broth with an incredible depth of flavor. I never would bother ordering miso or shoyu as those are too easy. Tonkotsu broth, however,  takes hours upon hours to develop the right flavor. So on my first visit, I felt the best way to test their ramen making skills was to start with the piece de resistance of Japanese ramen. 
   Before I get to the ramen, we started with an order of the brussel sprouts and the karaage (fried chicken). The brussels were horribly under seasoned. The karaage was more like popcorn chicken bits and would have fared better with the traditional accompaniments (i.e salt, lemon, mayo) than the so-so runny dipping sauce it came with. Not bad but it had me wishing for the real thing. Alright now for the ramen. It came out looking beautiful. All the usual garnishes were there and THEN some. I tasted one spoonful of the broth and my heart sank a little bit. The right flavors were there, but dialed WAAAAAAYYYY down. As if the broth hadn't been cooked long enough, or they watered it down to get more servings out of it. What a shame. The pork however was absolutely delicious. The onsen egg was a nice idea but soft boiled eggs fare better in tonkotsu broth, so I missed that texture in there. The noodles, while I appreciate that they make them in house, are cooked too long, lacking a slight chew that one looks for in a ramen noodle. I cannot say on any level that the ramen was terrible. It just wasn't right. If you have never had the real thing before, I can see how this would still be delicious. But if you have a point of reference its rather disappointing. Especially considering the bill.
To avoid being a complete negative Nancy I will say that the avocado soft serve was really tasty, if I lived in this neighborhood I would be dropping in or this in the summer on the regs, and they do have a really nice pot of green tea. 
   Since my friends adore this place they once again invited me for a meal there. I accepted with hesitation but figured it wouldn't be right for me to write off a place after one visit. I decide I would go again and try other things off the menu. This time around I ordered the pork belly buns and the tuna donburi. The pork belly buns were pretty good, but I suppose I was expecting pieces of pork like what comes in the ramen, but instead of melt in your mouth succulence it was quite dry and chewy. A little over sauced too, since gochujang has a tendency to be overpowering. But it was a decent size for the price I would say. Now the tuna donburi, while appealing to the eye, was pretty bad. The tuna was super fishy tasting (seconded by my friend who tried what I no longer had interest in eating), made worse by the pulverized texture of the tuna. No amount of soy sauce could help with the flavor. I had a few bites and couldn't stomach any more.I did try a spoonful of my friends shoyu ramen and it was rather tasty, far more flavor than the tonkotsu broth (which is also tried again..same verdict). 
   As for service, the waitress we have had both times is very friendly and peppy, However one can't help but notice the other waitress' attitude dropping off or picking up plates as well as her interaction with other patrons. Its as if she came to work immediately finding out her dog died or something. She has a miserable expression on her face, slams down plates and rolls her eyes. Not sure why she has a job dealing with people as she seems to loathe them.
  To wrap up this epically long review....I don't really get the hype. Perhaps very few people in Charlotte have had the real thing, or perhaps they do as my friends do which is add in every hot sauce and condiment until you can't even taste what was in there in the first place. But even still the taste of that tuna was universally inexcusable. I will say that the tunes they play in here are really quite brilliant but there is a still an authentic ramen void in my heart, right along side authentic Korean food and a place like The Steeple.

"A new Japanese cafe in the Yonge and Sheppard area that offers different selections of mochi, madelaines, angel hat cake, cheese cake and ice cream. They just opened so looks like they're still ironing out the kinks but for now I give them 3 stars. We got:
- Orange daifuku mochi: It was interesting! Basically a whole mandarin orange wrapped in mochi. I prefer the daifuku at Tsujiri, but this was still worth a try. They also offer other interesting ones like kiwi (ice cream filling)
- Banana daifuku (ice cream filling and banana): delicious. I am hooked!!
- Strawberry chocolate daifuku - good
- Sakura no bake cheesecake: It was a bit too sweet and jelly-like for my taste. Though I heard they are affiliated with Uncle Testsu so I may go back and try their ""angel dome"" ones (matcha flavour).
- Mochi- found it sweet. We tried the sakura, sesame and matcha.
- Ice cream: It comes in a cute ""decorated"" cone. Stand out flavours were black sesame and taro (strong taste), while mango and ginger were like ones you get at the ayce places. They also have other flavours like matcha, strawberry, chocolate. Great value - $5 for 2 scoops.
- Original flavour Angel hat cheesecake - ok

Great drink selection. Insane whiskey selection. All reasonably priced.

SERVICE:
Waiters and servers are quick, fast, courteous and knowledgeable. Doesn't get better.

My only complaint is that it's loud and dark. Which is slightly annoying when I want to catch-up with friends who visit me in Pittsburgh and want show them this amazing restaurant only to have trouble hearing and seeing them.

"Hi Yelp community! Today I'll review another hookah lounge. City and East is a bar oriented to young people. I went a Saturday night and it was pretty chill. Close to 11PM music started getting louder and became more like a night club. Drinks came on a plastic cup and that makes the place loose some points. We order a bottle of champagne, however they did don't have champagne glasses. The hookah was good but no natural charcoal! I liked the music and vibe to the place.",1.0
"This place has a lot of options including teas, smoothies, boba, etc..a lot of what you would expect in a place like this. I particularly appreciate that they allow you to control the level of sweetness. I got the coconut milk tea, regular sweet level, with boba. It was a little too sweet for me so next time, I would lower the level of sweetness. The boba itself was sweet as well but the consistency was mediocre. Some of them were soft throughout but others were not. The inside of this place is awkward. I came here at night. It was very dimly lit, and the space seemed very narrow. Maybe if I came here during the daytime, it would have been less weird. The young lady working there was helpful and quick with making my drink. Overall, this place is average. I didn't notice anything distinct, but I would consider coming back or stopping by if it was convenient to test additional options.",1.0
"Friendly staff, great food and drinks. Tried their breakfast pizza today and latte and had a great time with some friends. Although simple, the pizza was awesome! Thin crust, cheese, bacon, and an egg in the center - a nice mix of italian and american together. The latte, pretty tasty but could be better with the presentation. The service is awesome, no complaints here.",1.0
"Wahlburgers. 

The long wait ended up being of no use as we took over some bar seating right before we were due up. Regardless, the hostesses seemed a bit overwhelmed by the rush. Our server was the opposite...meaning great. Quick and attentive. Knew her stuff. 

The Wahl...burgers
They're arranged alright. They reminded me a bit of the burgers you can find at The Habit but the problem came with the meat. They need to get a new distributor out at their Vegas location because it just did not taste right. I don't expect kobe beef but I do expect a clean taste that doesn't end in a bitter note after the culmination of ingredients. 

The fries were okay. No special seasoning or special cut, average. The alcohol choices were your normal things + 1 or 2 decent draft beers. 

Although my experience wasn't the worst...with Wahlburgers in other spots around the country I would advise to try them elsewhere. It could be another example of the Whataburger problem...sucks in Arizona but amazing in Texas. So maybe sucks in Nevada but amazing in Massachusetts?",1.0
"Hi, I would like to start off with saying I use to be such a massive fan of this place. I absolutely loved it. There wasn't too many tourists and it was fun just to mellow out and play games, but I don't know if it's under new management or what because I've been hearing tons of new stories about people getting chewed out there recently by the employees or the owner. I brushed it off and was like ""oh whatever, it's a small business and they must be super protective of their machines"" I go there all the time and I've never had a problem so I didn't think anything was gonna change. One of my friends from out of town was visiting and it was totally a last minute thing where I took her there, I do it with everyone I know who visits from out of town (not doing that anymore). So we walked in but I goofed and forgot to bring in cash and they still haven't put in an ATM, so it's whatever I usually go to the 7\/11 around the corner and get cash there. But my friend was visiting like I said so she like let's just take classically touristy photos real quick and then go get the money, then we can focus on playing games. Anyway I'm taking photos of her on her little film camera, and we have a lady politely walk up to us and say ""oh these aren't for commercial use right?"". We tell her they're not, and they're just to document her trip. Little time goes by and we are just about out the door to go get some money, and this wild man who looks like a coal miner just straight up coming at this tiny foreign girl who is my friend and knows very little English start chewing her out saying. Oh you don't know the three rules of taking the photos, and repeating it to her and yelling at her because I had just taken a photo of her. I then walk up to him to understand what's happening, because her English is good but it isn't that good, and she also has severe social anxiety, and he was causing a scene. So I was like whatever, what's this old grouchy man have to say. So I hear him out and he is explaining to me (but he is yelling it all at me) that I can't take photos there commercially, okay I already knew that. But no it's not just commercially for him, you can't post photos online, or on social media, you can basically only scrapbook and show it to no one. Then with the second rule things get a little wild he says this really loud in front of everyone, you can't take photos of kids (we weren't taking photos of kids mind you, he just felt the need to express that very loud and vocally) or he would have to call the police, and that the third rule we would have to play games or leave. We had been there for 10 minutes, if it was my first time there it wasn't even enough time to look around for a game even if I was prepared with the cash. But the whole time I was thinking I work in customer service in Vegas, and I sometimes have to deal with the worse people, the weirdest demands and dealing with how angry people can be when you tell them no, and to be yelled at like I'm at work on my time off where I go to blow off steam for rules that I didn't break and I just wanted to play some games there. It sucks. I love that place but these new people are pretty awful. My friend walked away after the second rule with the kids because he was openly humiliating and demeaning two people that didn't do anything to him, so she walked away to have a panic attack and he was mad that she walked off, and yelling at me with how rude she was. I was polite only because I wanted to come back there again. But in all honesty thinking back I would never go back there. That man who yelled at me was a tiny man who wanted to feel big, and the fact he has a place like that must make him feel powerful for the first time in his life. But he without that place he would be nothing. 

In all honesty I would recommend going there if you love confrontation, people to cause a scene, or you're feeling nostalgic about being scolded by your parents. If you're visiting I'm sure you can find other really cool places or better ways to spend your time and money then contemplating posting up with an old man for your vacation.",1.0

Annoy so secret gem for the best tacos in Pittsburgh! You order inside the grocery store and then give your ticket to the taco stand outside. These are pretty filling tacos and I'd recommend the beef and chorizo. Next to the stand there's an array of toppings and salsas that you can load up on. This is a must stop taco place!,1.0

Every time I come by to pick Pepper up, we have a hard time leaving since Pepper always feels at home. Their service is great and Shauna gives the absolute best haircuts. I can leave Pepper in the salon feeling at ease and come back to pick up a happy groomed pup.",1.0

"Zafran is officially my new go-to for Indian food. When it comes to Indian, I much prefer the buffet. That way I can get a good try of a spoonful of every item in the line-up. I really enjoy the thorough variety of mostly vegetarian options. If you're tired of eating vegetables the boring American way (raw, crunchy and tiring to chew into a swallowable mass) then Indian food is seriously the way to go.

I've been in numerous times on the weekdays for lunch. On my first visit I made the mistake of not coming hungry and ordered something specific from the menu. It was good, but spicy beyond what I expected. Also, it took a while to get it. All the while I got to stare longingly at the buffet. The next several times I never again made that mistake. On the buffet they always have: chicken biryani rice, chicken tikka masala, pakora, white rice and naan. Plus a few other items. The pakora is usually composed of different vegetables every day - I've seen onions, potatoes and various greens. You can often find palak of some kind with paneer or potatoes for example. Aloo gobi also shows up sometimes which I quite like. At the end of the buffet you can find a ""dessert bar"" with usually three options. I'm not a huge fan of Indian after-dinner items but I at least know that they keep raita there. At the checkout counter they also have the anise stuff you're supposed to chew on after your meal - also not a fan!

The service here is great. The guys are always polite and happy to chat and answer any questions you might have. It's generally a self-serve environment. Grab your own water jug and a cup and just keep it at your table. It's also generally a good idea to clean up after yourself and place used plates in the tray above the trashcan. The price is a bit high I have to admit. It comes to $10 for a lunch buffet during the week or $12 for it on the weekend. I imagine the weekend buffet has more to offer and also more people. The restaurant is almost totally empty during weekday lunchtime which makes for a more chill-out experience. Lastly, they play Indian music and TV for entertainment.

This is absolutely my new favorite Indian restaurant in the area near my new job. I will be a once a week customer for sure.",1.0
This was some of the best Thai food I have ever had! The tom kha soup was absolutely amazing! It was an assault on my taste buds in a great way! The pineapple curry fried rice was amazing as well!

"One of the places I went to during this break is Nad√®ge, which opened up relatively recently in Yorkdale Mall! They've always had a few locations downtown. Yorkdale Mall upgraded themselves with stores like Canada Goose, Muji, Uniqlo and Nad√®ge was part of the expansion. I believe the Nad√®ge in Yorkdale is their biggest location - but don't quote me on that.

Besides their widely known macarons, Nad√®ge also sell cakes, tarts, quiches, chocolate, sandwiches and even offer drinks there! But you know me... My eyes hover towards the macaron section~

I got a box of 6 macarons, which was $15. They had a huge selection of macarons which made it hard just to choose 6 flavours! They had almost 20 flavours of macaron available!! Macaron heaven for me~

Chocolate Fleur de Sel, Salted Caramel, Santa macaron which was a seasonal macaron, consisting of hazelnut and praline; Champagne, Cappuccino and Vanilla.

I was excited for the Champagne macaron because it was a completely new flavour and it has a slight shimmer to it, which I thought was super fitting for champagne flavour. The taste, however, wasn't up to par as the looks, it would be on the low end of my box of 6.

Next up is Chocolate Fleur de Sel which was so good! It was definitely a safe choice for me since I like chocolate, but I thought the design of it was cute as well. Nad√®ge had both Chocolate and Chocolate Fleur de Sel flavours, since I don't know the difference between either flavours, I just chose the one with the cuter design. Chocolate was just plain brown in appearance compared to the speckled brown of the Chocolate Fleur de Sel.

The Santa macaron was one out of the three seasonal macarons they offered! I only remember the other one being a Reindeer macaron... I didn't like the other two flavours of the macarons even though they were cute and festive. The Santa macaron was a mixture of hazelnut and praline, which tasted more hazelnut, less praline... But I enjoyed it! Plus, how can you resist how cute and festive this design of the macaron is? 

Out of all the flavours, I enjoyed the Cappuccino, Santa and Chocolate Fleur de Sel macaron the most.

The service was lovely, and the girl even provided us samples to try while I was looking for the flavours to choose. The samples, however, was as hard as a freaking rock - definitely not enjoyable at all. But we all know why it was a sample....

Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more flavours. I love the design and layout of Nad√®ge in Yorkdale Mall! Pure white, and full of fun colourful sweets to brighten up the store. They even have several seats for people who want to dine in at that time.

Do note that while paying, tax\/tip isn't included in the price. So a box of $15, was $15 flat - I guess they already added tax with the price, which was nice! :)",1.0

"This cinema experience is better than most others (ok, not The Manor because that is just plain special).  But, better than Lowe's because Lowe's got rid of most of their staff in favor of automated ticket kiosks and drink machines.  I kind of prefer a real person tending to my needs, plus Cinemark gives more employment opportunities.  

But, the real draw to this particular Cinemark is that because of the curfew imposed on teens without adults at the Monroeville Mall, that means less people in attendance on opening premier nights, thus more opportunity for me (such as in the opening of a particular Star Wars movie I recall.  We went online, ordered a ticket easily and showed up at movie time and enjoyed our flick.  Incredible.)

And, last evening (Saturday) my husband and I saw a 7:45pm showing of ""The Circle"" and we paid a total of 10.00 (4 for him -- senior citizen rate and 6 for me).  Then, I had signed up for Cinemark reward emails and had a coupon for a free small popcorn with purchase of any size soft drink so I got a popcorn and medium diet coke for 4.95.  Thus, our date nite of a movie and concession treats came to 14.95.  Yeah, go beat that for stadium seating, a theatre close by (minutes from our house) on a Saturday night.  Think not.",1.0
"Like this place and the owner. But, when I am told about my ""mouth"" and offending customers. 

As a neighborhood patron who spends money and tips, I won't be back. It's a brewery and if you are that offended by language there are more things in life to be offended about like...the state of our educational system, the fact we don't care and throw everything away than swear words or fingers. 

It's an insult that the owner had to have a ""talk"" with me and I won't support this brewery. It's large enough if you get offended move or go elsewhere. I spent many times there and I have other places I can go without that nonsense and better food 3 miles down the street and a patio.",1.0

Jenn knew exactly what I wanted and together worked out the perfect formula for my hair! She is a color expert.

"The first time I came was for Sunday brunch which I came with a couple different girlfriends about a month ago.  It was slightly crowded, but not so crowded we felt ignored.  We sat on the lovely patio and the host automatically took care of us.  He opened up the umbrella, made sure the area was to our liking.  This place is classy!  I just enjoy having my coffee served on a nice little plate with a tiny metal creamer (as opposed to the bowl of plastic creamers).  I had the delicious goat cheese omelet and fresh pineapple.  It really didn't cost too much for the quality of food you get.

I came here a second time with my girlfriend this past Wednesday and you all did not disappoint. It wasn't too busy when we got their about 11:30, but filled up around noon.  The sever, Stephen (Steven) was very prompt, thoughtful and friendly.  I had the squash soup to start with...it was over-the-top delicious!!!  HAVE THE SQUASH SOUP!  I then had a salmon wrap with a miso-slaw.  I had enough to take home with me.  My girlfriend had the terrific macaroni and cheese.  Not your southern macaroni and cheese.  This was lighter, and dare I say gourmet?  I think it came to about $15.00 per person, again, not too bad for the quality of food.  I just wanted to add that my girlfriend and I chatted for a really, really long time and never did they give us the bums rush, Stephen just kept filling our water and occassionally answering any questions we have.  Just one more thing about Stephen, someone forgot their to go box and he rushed outside to find them to ensure they got  their left overs.

"So I've taken a little break from Tao since my last incident. This time around, I wanted to give it another shot. I remember the food being great, regardless of what we had ordered. Well I'm glad I came back because the food was awesome! We started with the lobster dim sum, which was honestly OKAY, I wasn't a huge fan. A spicy tuna hand roll which was excellent, the orange chicken, and the lobster fried rice. What I love about tao is that their food is very consistent. Always tasting great regardless of which time you visit. 
Our server was also great! Knew he menu really well to point out specifics. I didn't like that our table was wobbly the entire time we were eating. Clearly their turn over is pretty high. I would think they would have replaced it by now instead of trying to insert pieces of wood on the bottoms that don't solve the issue. 
I hate to dwell on a similar issue, but the host was horrible. Our reservations were for 9:45 and we arrived at 9:50. He told us they were cleaning off our table and will take us back shortly. At 10pm I ask about our table and he says ""any minute now"". Well 10:15 rolls around and he points me out and asks for my last name again... whattttt.... I think he could tell I was furious. 30mins of standing around and you don't even check me in?! Well, we got seated shortly after; to find that there were plenty of tables available throughout the restaurant. The best part.... when the girl was walking us to the table she goes ""you will be sitting upstairs, is that okay with you..."" I ask if we can sit downstairs and she goes ""there will be a bit of a wait"" I told her we waited enough and she replies ""perfect, right this way then"". I think a refresh on customer service and etiquette wouldn't hurt for anyone at the front desk!",1.0

My move out charges were $400! I can understand being charged for the remainder of the electricity, gas, etc. costs for the month that I lived there but charging me to replace their carpets with an additional cleaning charge on top of that?

"Went here last week with 3 toddlers 2 adults and 1 senior.   It was ok I guess. Very pricey trip but the kids had fun. We were basically there from opening to closing.  Depending on which exit you leave, you could end up waiting a long time to get out, I'm guessing it wont be as bad if you don't wait until after closing time.  

We were mostly in the kids section, and there were few rides that you had tot wait a bit for ,but overall I would say it was not too bad.

The drink plan is a good one to have, but the dining plan was not good for us.  I find it was not very easy to use them as well, as certain locations, you can only get certain type of items.

"I was out shopping for a new laptop. Upon arrival at this location, not a single employee in sight to help us. I had to ask the cashier to call someone over. 10 minutes later, the manager comes out and assists us. We were after a laptop that was on clearance, and we agreed to buy the laptop after he offered us an addition 10% off. We are told that it needs to be reformatted and should take one hour. Not a big deal, it's in a shopping plaza so there was plenty to occupy our time with while waiting. We return an hour later with the news that the computer was not ready. He took down our number and stated he would call us when it was ready. Note, that was at 3:30pm that day. It was now 11:30am the NEXT DAY and still no phone call. I called and asked if the computer was ready, I'm told that it finished overnight and is now ready. I asked why I did not receive a phone call like I was promised and was told that ""they didn't have time"". 
Sounds like an excuse to me. So I drive down there, the manager who was helping us the day before does not come over to talk to us. Instead, a different manager comes over and begins boxing the computer up. I asked her if it is a standard practice not to call the customer when their item is ready, especially when it's been almost 20 hours since the promised time. Her response was ""we are short handed, nobody is designated to the tech department, and there was no note on the laptop regarding why it was there"". Seriously?

A tip is to park in the parking garage behind Crispy Crepe and walk towards the light rail.  The restaurant is on the right...you can't miss it.

We had four people on a Wednesday at 6 pm.  The place was busy and we had a small wait.  We were seated ""communal style"" beside other people at the large table in the middle.  You can get your own table if you get there early.

Three of us ordered the Miso Ramen and we all loved it!  The pork belly and egg is something special.  The other person in our group got small plates (Gyoza and pork belly and duck steam buns) and they all looked great.

"I had really become disappointed with how my hair stylist had been doing my hair and was on a mission to find someone new who would get me in terms of how I like to style my hair. I am a pretty bold person and when I see a woman with what I consider a great haircut or style, I will always walk up to her and ask the question - ""Who does your hair?"" That is exactly how I found my current hair dresser Andy! 

Andy is a master! He is friendly, kind, truthful and always does his best to make sure when you leave his chair, you look good. His pricing is comparable to any other stylist around town. I now have my Mom and daughter going to him. I must admit I was nervous about a new stylist handling my coloring, but I should not have been since Andy had no problem nailing my color. We just clicked from the start and I am so glad I found him. 

The salon itself is large with many stations and it is open so everyone can see one another and check out some amazing new cuts and colors being performed. In addition, they offer organic spray tans and a wide variety of products for your hair. Most of the products I have not seen at other salons but have tried quite a few now. The front entrance also features jewelry for sale from local artists although most pieces are pretty pricey. There is also a make up table where one can be transformed into a gorgeous goddess in no time at all.

I had problem after problem with True View when replacing all of the windows and sliding doors on my newly purchased house. They left broken glass all over the yard. They did such a bad job on install that they had to send a crew out to re-do some of the work. The biggest issue is that they did not even come close to the timeline relayed to me by the sales guy. I was told by sales that the windows would be installed before Christmas. I approved the purchase order on November 29th. (Thank goodness I pay attention. The first purchase order they wanted me to agree to was completely wrong.) They didn't even start the install until mid January and it was February 20th by the time the job was finally completed to a respectable standard. Because the windows ended up being installed in 2017 instead of 2016, I was unable to claim the now expired tax credit.",1.0
"Updating my review...

the Manager reached out to me via phone and offered to look at my car and see what was wrong last week after I posted my negative review on Yelp.

I couldn't make a return trip to their location right away so we agreed to meet a week later.  
When I arrived the Manager greeted me and took my key and re-washed my car. 

I Paid 41.00 for the Manager special- buy one get one free last week - so I basically got my 2nd wash that I had actually paid for since I gave my card for the 2nd wash back to them last week asking for my money back. No money was ever refunded. 

Once the re-wash was done he asked me if it looked okay and - believe it or not AGAIN I pointed out to the Manager the lint and left over debris (for lack of a better description) still on my carpet front and back seat areas. 
His explanation was the rags left Lint - even though it was more than lint. 

He saw it and went and got the vacuum and  re-vacuumed my floors. 

I pointed out to him THAT dirty carpet was my very point of contention on my last visit. Carpets simply not cleaned well.

"It was my second time here. I wanted to have dim sum for New Year so here we came! 

There was a waiting line when we got there. However, it didn't take too long. The waiter handed the line very well. I was glad that I decided to come here on New Year day. 

We were seated in front of the cash register. It was like in the middle of the dinning room. The restaurant is bigger than its look. They have another dinning room which can accommodate for big parties at the back. They also use PLASTIC tablecloth for dinning tables which makes it easy for them to clean and set up tables in a few second. Is it good? Umm.. I'm fine with it though as long as tables are not dirty. 

DIM SUM is served ALL DAY which is perfect. They open until 2 am. So, it's good for night owls right? 

We ordered Shiu Mai, Har Gaw, Deep fried squid tentacle, deep fried chicken wings, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Sesame paste balls, Pork meat & shrimp dumpling in Chiu Chow style and crab meat with fish maw soup. The best part was Shiu Mai!  They were so big and yummy!  Now I knew why every table ordered it. The rest of our order were delicious too.  Only Har Gar and Fish Maw soup were just OK. 

How was the service? I didn't expect to talk to our waitress much because she didn't seem like to speak english. It was good enough for me (again) as long as she got our order correctly. It's Chinese restaurant and I always understand that.

"Mix 2 is the place to go if you're looking for a decent place to shoot some pool\/snooker. Compared to other pool spots (Le Cue \/ Master Q), I would say the price is the same if not a tad cheaper. 

The quality of the tables is not the greatest but it gets the job done. The cues are also not in the best shape but like I said, they get the job done haha. Weekends can get packed extremely quick so I'd recommend booking a table a head of time (call in). 

Another pro to coming a little earlier is you'll be able to choose a decent pool cue, as later in the night with a full house, the last cues left over are really poor in quality.....but they get the job done. 

I've never played darts but it seems fun and if you bring your own darts you won't have to pay a $5 deposit to borrow theirs. Also never ordered food so can't speak for that but when anything comes out it smells pretty good.

Overall, I'm going to be back as I'm an avid (and extremely good ) pool player and this is simply the closest place. There's nothing that's too much of a negative for me to go somewhere else if I don't have to. I recommend Mix2 to any of my buddies who want to go shoot pool. 4\/5.",1.0

The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because the dentist was actually very nice and the lady who called me when i stormed out was very nice. But other than that i feel this was a bait and hook situation. I called and made an appointment them knowing i had insurnace and being told they would verify my insurance never once being told this was foming out of my pocket than i myself have to charge my insurance company. They basically wasted my time to come in were trying so hard to push me to do it on credit which i dont want want to do and thank god i put a block on my social were nothing goes through at first until i am contacted through the mail. Not at ANY TIME in the phone conversation did they tell me i was going to pay the full price than i have to go bill my own insurance.  Very shady and misleading practice. Thank god found a great dentist down the street who was honest and helped me out today because i had such a bad root canal that was infected but no thanks to this shady company,1.0
"I spoke to the cashier about my bill.  She didn't do what I would have done if I was in her position working in the food industry.  It was a technicality for over charging me.  It doesn't even come out of the store, it's Chipotle company deals for members.   I came in today, because I wanted to use my BOGO before it expires.  I also have been waiting to try out the online order.  I normally order in person two entrees with guacamole on the side with the meals.  When I did the order online, it asks me if I wanted my guacamole on the side, I clicked on it.  When I came into the store, I noticed I was charged a little more with my BOGO.  It wasn't half the bill.  She charged me for 2 entrees with two side orders of guacamole instead of guacamole within my entree.  When I look online on my order receipt, it's shown the guacamole is within the entree not a side order.  I told her that, she said I can't order like that.  Next time order with the guacamole and side note to type there I want it on the side.  I told here there isn't a section to do that.  She kept telling me there is one.  I can't be crazy....I just checked before writing this review... there isn't a section for that.  All of this for $1.95 guacamole.  I told her ok whatever.  It's a simple fix, it's a technicality charge.  What pissed me off even more, when I got home, one of my entree was missing cheese.... I would say the communication with the online order is not good experience.  I was overcharged more  for technicality and my order isn't correct.  Good thing, she checked the order again before handing it to me, because there was a missing guacamole.  

That's one.... now a week ago I was here again.  I came in with no one in front of me ordering.  But right after I ordered one burrito and a bowl, the line started to build up.  I can tell the server started to get irritated while she was doing me order.  It was the fajita veggies on both entrees that got me.  It was old looking and empty, the girl literally grabbed one bell pepper and 3 onion stings for the burrito and the same for the bowl.  I even asked her can I have a little more and she just added 2 onion stings... can't she just grab a fresh one?  Then she turned around and yelled at her coworkers, ""I need help!""  Every ingredients they had were low, they made my two entrees really light than usual, I didn't bother to keep asking for more for every ingredient.

"This is my review from a past experience that I'm adding to Yelp since it is not reflected here...

If I could give them 0 stars, I would. ¬†For starters, the physical therapists are terrible. ¬†I ultimately had to go back to my doctor, who referred me to another doctor, who put me back in PT - a real Physical Therapist this time. ¬†The real PT (not VibrantCare) was awesome.

Let's get into it: ¬†First day of PT, before I even start my session, one of the Physical Therapists is literally yelling (he was from New York) at another therapist. ¬†They got into a screaming match about having too many patients and not enough therapists. ¬†I should've left that moment when he said ""we need to start canceling appointments, this is not therapy"" (he was right). ¬†Anyways. ¬†After listening to their yelling match I was evaluated by an idiot. ¬†The guy clearly didn't know what he was doing. ¬†Anyways, he evaluates me and gives me a piece of paper with neck stretches to do at home. ¬†I ask ""Is that it?"" ¬†his response: ""what do you mean?"" ¬†My response: ""These stretches only will do the trick? ¬†I don't need any sort of manual therapy, massage therapy, adjustments, or coming into the therapy?"" ¬†him: ""oh yeah... come here 3 times ¬†a week for 4 weeks""... Idiot.

That first 4 weeks was ridiculous. ¬†So the new yorker therapist was my therapist - I never saw the evaluator after day 1. ¬†They fired the new yorker after week 1 for his antics on my day 1. ¬†After they fired him, I never saw the same therapist more than once. ¬†So I had to go over everything from start to finish with each therapist each time. ¬†Needless to say, the shottyness of their therapy was not healing me. ¬†There was very very very little progress, but since there was some progress, my doctor extended my sessions another 6 weeks. ¬†10 weeks total. ¬†After 10 weeks, my doc said ""look, you should've been healed - I'm going to refer you to a spine specialist"". ¬†The spine specialist referred me to a different doctor, who referred me to another Physical Therapy place. ¬†Within a couple weeks of manual therapy, massage therapy, and real exercises that strengthened my core and my back, I was healed... Unlike the stupid neck stretches that VibrantCare had me do.

Here's the kicker... after VibrantCare racked up all these bills and billed my medical insurance, they sent me a bill. ¬†I tried calling a lady named Lisa, who is, according to their messaging system, the accounting rep for Arizona. ¬†I left 4 voicemails with Lisa. ¬†No call back. ¬†Needless to say, after a few months of invoices, and me calling them and leaving voicemails, they send me to collections. ¬†I called again and asked to speak to Lisa's Supervisor... ""Lisa who? who is Lisa?"" ¬†These people are amazingly idiotic. ¬†Apparently Lisa doesn't exist. ¬†So I deal with a lady named Miriam. ¬†I explain the bad service, arguments between therapists, shotty treatments, and how I had to go elsewhere to get healed, etc... to which she said ""well you still were treated so you owe the bill"" ¬†I said ""no, I wasn't treated... the new place treated me and healed me... you guys simply billed my insurance for nonsense"". ¬†Ultimately, I paid the bill after she confirmed everything I said and still said ""yes, everything you said was validated, but you still owe the bill"".

So I told her ""ok, I'll pay the bill, but I'm going to leave negative feedback"" to which she threatened legal action if I left negative reviews. ¬†I said ""Ok, have your lawyer contact me then, because I as a consumer can leave any negative feedback about your terrible service""

"This was my first experience with Peruvian cuisine.  Not knowing what to order, I went with the Arroz con Pollo, since it's your basic Latin dish.  I was immediately hit with the flavor of the rice.  It's as if they mixed delicious chimichuri sauce with white rice.  The dark meat of the chicken was juicy and the skin was crisp.  The onion garnish on the side even had amazing tangy flavor I've never had before.  El Chullo took a basic dish and nailed it.

On my second trip, I wanted to explore the menu so I went with the Escabeche de Pollo.  That dish has become one of the best things I have ever tried.  The sauce is the star of the dish with its amazing savory flavor.  It magnified the juicy dark meat of the chicken.  The dish also came with a pyramid of white rice, a couple of nicely crisped slices of sweet potatoes that paired nicely with the escabeche sauce, and those tangy onions I have come to love.

Third trip, I had the Lomo Saltado.  It's basically like loaded fries.  Not bad.  

Appetizers, oh my.  The Papa Rellena is amazing.  It's a ball of mash potato that is filled with meat, hard egg, olives, and raisins.  The outside of the potato ball is fried shut so it holds it's shape.  Don't let the raisins stop you from trying it, it's not overpowering.

"Camping World Henderson NV

I bought my motor home from Camping World in Houston TX and the experience was great even though they had poor reviews. I needed warranty service in the desert and the most convenient option was Camping World Henderson NV. I checked reviews and true to form they were poor. Poor customer service both in the shop and retail. A couple of reviews talked about feeling taken advantage of by the service department. Well, I went with it anyway as it was the house A\/C and it was an easy swap out because it was already authorized and shipped by Airexcell. 

I showed up an hour before my appointment and checked in at the service desk with Derrick. I've been working with Derrick over the phone for over a week to get everything lined up and he's been great! All looks good until we get to him telling me Airexcell only authorized 1.5 hours labor to make the swap and anything beyond that is on me. So if the unit was modified or any other work is required the shop rate is $129. hour! WOW that seems a little steep! Anyway I mention that if that's the case I would like to see what has to happen before we spend anything beyond whats been authorized. With the reviews I've read I have this vision of this turning into more than just a quick swap out and at their shop rate adding up quickly. 

They take my keys and bring the rig into the shop with me following. This is where this goes sideways and as the others have mentioned the poor customer service is demonstrated. I mention that because of the limited labor allowance and an interest in seeing how its done I would like to sit quietly and watch. Well, you'd have thought I poked both tech's right in the eye! They became very angry and visibly pissed and basically demanded I leave the shop area. The one guy tells me "" I do these all the time, I know what I'm doing"". At this point I reassure them I wasn't trying make them mad just want to see how the unit is installed. They weren't having any of it so I left. You know maybe these guy's should read their reviews so they would understand why someone might have concerns.  

I wonder around the store for what seems only about 20-30 minutes tops and the older guy with the worst attitude finds me cruising the isles. He takes me out and they have the rig generator running and the A\/C on. He has me go in and confirm the unit is working. I put my hand up to the grill which is what Coleman calls a Chill Grill. You can open and close some vent's and control how much goes into the duct system or the living room. It also has filtered air intakes and the grill separates the two air streams so you don't feed cooled air back into the system. The first thing I notice is the cooled air is coming out of the air intakes! Which since I've taken the grill apart before means it was installed backwards! So the guy that claims to ""do these all the time"" doesn't even know which way the grill goes on! Since I know what the problem is and how easy it is to fix I say nothing. My thought is just get out of there and check everything and change the grill out in the parking lot. Who knows what these two would do if I point out they screwed up!

I go back inside to finish up paper work with Derrick. I'm thinking sign something and on my way. Nope, I owe them $ 8 and change for shop towels! Really......whatever, at this point I'm done and just want out of there! I pay up and head out to the parking lot.

I get to the rig and hop in. The generator is still running and A\/C is on. There are 2 large what I guess are shop towels on the passenger seat unused. Hmm are these the very important shop towels I paid for and not even used......again whatever. I shut everything down and check everything out. I unscrew the grill and sure enough the inner plate that separates cooled air from intake air is in backwards! I turn it around and screw everything back in place. Now everything is working as it should.

I take her to this awful place that is in dire need of business since after paying for the required exam - I received her report card and couldn't believe my eyes. This place was so hard up for business they tried selling me all sorts of ""necessary"" procedures. They need to be shut down! My vet laughed and shook his head. Now, after paying and getting the paperwork for a three year shot, this awful place has ""spread the word"" that it was only a one year vaccination?? I have their paperwork and the state's.
Please walk your dog on by that dreadful place that is so hard up for business they stop at nothing! Shame on them and the vet .",1.0
"I'm obsessed with their salads, hummus and the rest of the food, all of which is very fresh and delicious.  Even the atmosphere is nice (for a strip center restaurant); you almost feel like you're in Armenia.  I do wish they were open on Monday, since I use them often for dinner takeout.",1.0
"Good, service, & atmosphere was amazing! A must stop to eat if you're a health junky for sure. Place can get packed pretty quick which can cause issues if you wanna sit down & eat. But that just goes to show how good the food is. Do stop by & check it out!!!",1.0
"My boss is obsessed about Kinton Ramen lol. And since we work across the street, we always end up eating here every other week for lunch... is this even healthy? lmao.... it sure slows me down at work after because of major itis lol.

Funny thing, he often challenges us to finish the whole bowl of ramen, soup and all, so that he (we) could collect more stamps lol. 1 bowl = 1 stamp. Just letting you know if you are reading this, boss, we still have a LONG way to go from 1,000 stamps for that $1,000 Gift card lol.

I try to stay away from the fatty pork, so I usually order chicken. Not bad actually... meat is very soft and tender. I tried the Chicken Miso Ramen (asked for less salt) and it was delicious. My all time favourite would probably be the Chicken Spicy Jalapano Ramen. I love that spicy x creamy soup base. But that one would be a bit hard to down at the end for that one stamp lol.

I also really enjoyed the Chikichiki Don. It is chopped chicken breast with Kinton original mayo sauce on rice. Simple but definitely one of my favourite appetizers because it is semi torched :) I shall try the Tonton Don (chopped pork with Kinton original sauce on rice) next time.

"Amazing show!! My wife and I finally got a chance to see this last night and we left astounded with awe! This is a very entertaining blend of singing, dance and of course a wide array of incredible magic tricks and illusions. The show opened with Ginette Davis, a talented classicly-trained Soprano, giving the audience a trio of songs to set the mood. Then it was into the main event! Craig Davis is a master of card tricks, juggling, feats of balance and magic tricks. Assisted by a gifted assistant Maraika, a talented belly dancer in her own right as the show would attest, she and Craig take the audience on a stunning and baffling journey through brain-twisting illusions. Craig also incorporates his pet bird, a Conure named Peaches, who almost steals the show with cuteness. With lots of audience participation, this a very entertaining evening that is great for the whole family. This would also be a really good thing to do on Date-night. 
Set in a very unique and intimate venue in a space on an artists' live\/work compound, the show is accentuated with top-notch lighting and special-effects: it's like mini-Vegas. After the show Craig and Peaches do photos with anyone who'd like to hold the bird; I'm a huge animal lover so of course I had to meet her!
The Davis team also generously provide complimentary snacks and water.
We plan to go back with out-of-town visitors as this would be a really fun thing to do with people wanting to experience something unique.
I hope this show gains enough popularity to be able to do more than the few shows they put on every month. It's like a hidden gem that needs to be discovered! 
Seating is limited, so be sure to book in advance. They offer return guests discounts so be sure to ask about that before leaving.
The Davis Circus of Illusion gets a resounding 5-stars from us!!! Bravo!",1.0
"Where to start?  Walking in, it had the feel of a Vegas casino.  I know that sounds strange, but hear me out.  It's large, open, and feels fancy with browns and golds throughout the dining area.  But what really got me was the smell.  It had the aura of a piped-in perfume, much like some Las Vegas casinos and their reception areas.  I'm not complaining - it was nice, but not what I expected.

We sat down as a group of 8.  Plenty of room - it wasn't busy at all (11:45am on a Monday).  As we all know by now, the menu is extensive.  Knowing this ahead of time, I was browsing online to narrow down my choices so I was ready at game time.  I went with the pit beef dip sandwich that came with fries.  I had heard about the gigantic portions, so I figured for the $14.50 I would eat half of it for lunch and save the other half for dinner.  When it arrived, I was a little disappointed to see it was ""normal sized"".  It was delicious - no doubt.  I'd eat this again (and again and again).  The portion of fries was also reasonable.  Frankly, it was a great portion for lunch, but the price was steep for what I got.

Everyone else seemed pretty happy with their food - ranging from jambalaya to white chili to a chicken parm sandwich.  As we all got our food and started to eat, we noticed one in our party had no food.  After a minute, a manager (SUPER nice and very attentive) came by to apologize for the meal not being ready - it was done, but not done properly, so they were making it again.  Great - I love that they have standards!  The manager also was quick to say there would be no charge for that meal.  When it came out, we all thought it looked great.

I'm not a big cheesecake fan.  I love cheese.  I really love cake.  But let's keep them separate, please.  So I miss out on that draw with this place.

All in all, I'd eat here again, but I'd rather do it with a BOGO coupon or something that dials in my perceived value.  Or if work was buying or something.  If I was out with people and they said ""hey, let's grab lunch somewhere"", I would suggest something else (financial decision).  The food is really good, but lots of places offer that.

If the prices are more reasonable, I bump this to 4 stars.",1.0

"It is hard to believe how bad the customer service is with this company. Do not do business with them. They shipped me a defective product and when I tried to call them literally every time I get voicemail. I called SIX times over three days and stayed on hold for ten minutes when the automatically put you to voicemail and never call you back. I also tried emailing them four times and twice got email saying that the request had been ""closed"", never responding. It is just incredible to me that a company can treat their customers with such total and utter disrespect. I don't know how to deal with this other than to post on social media.",1.0
"This was pretty awesome! Fremont Street itself was rad with its insanely cheap tables and drinks and why not follow it up with a zipline below the neon light show?! We picked the higher line and it was worth it and also you are up there flying for way longer than I thought! The ride itself is not super fast, but that initial takeoff is wild and the fact you are pretty high up is just a super cool way to experience another part of Vegas. Love that you can look ahead to the crazy lights and music or down to all the ppl below. Also, we had some friends who could not make their time slot on the day and the guide was very helpful in explaining when they can come and reschedule. The guide said we could wait up to like 45 mins to get on our ride even though they assign you a time but we didn't have to wait too long, maybe 15 mins once suited up. Also, they provide a bag for you to put any loose items like cell phone, glasses, shoes, etc. and it straps onto your line so it goes down with you, easy and professional system.

The only thing that can make this better is if they offered AYCE. Otherwise it's great.

"This place is probably my favourite studying place in the McGill Ghetto and definitely my favourite on Parc. I didn't frequent the Second Cup very much, but I'd been there enough times to notice, in my opinion, the definite improvements. For one, I love the new lighting! The lighting had been one of the main reasons I disliked studying at the Second Cup in the past. The other reason had been the rather awkwardly placed tables. Milton B improved this greatly with their large tables; in fact, my favourite place to sit is the big table in the middle.

As for what they serve, I have yet to try any food there since I tend to come after supper (I'm super glad they kept the open 24 hours feature).

 I went at about 5pm and it was super empty. The staff was nice, knew I was craving sugar and gave me some great recommendations. Next time I'm gonna try one of their brownies or tarts, they looked mouth watering.

I got three canollis, the Nutella, vanilla and chocolate. All of them tasted delicious. Not super sweet and yet really creamy. The shell was super soft as well and easy to bite on to. The powdered sugar on top was the only annoying part, it toppled a bit over and made a bit of a mess. The different flavours don't make that much of a difference I found, they were pretty faint.

"When staying at Bally's recently, this was one of the restaurants we tried. It's located along the internal walkway connecting Bally's to Paris. Arrived at 4pm which is a strange between lunch and dinner time, but we flew in from the East coast and were hungry! The hostess and servers were pleasant, but not over-the-top friendly. It wasn't crowded at all, so we were seated immediately. I got the Shaft's Bleu Burger and boyfriend got the California Chicken Burger. The sandwiches don't come with fries, so they have to be ordered separately. We opted to share an order. Fries came out first, followed by the burgers right after. Everything was tasty. My burger had a great flavor balance, with the burger, bacon and cheese tasting great together. The California Chicken sandwich was good too. He asked for a side of pickles, which came out quickly when requested, but wasn't a fan because they were sweet rather than dill. The fries came with a spiced ketchup, but it still tasted like regular ketchup to us, which is fine. No complaints here overall, and we'd consider eating here again if in the area.",1.0

Yes, the servers were nice, fast, and helpful. But the food is another topic. I ordered the combo platter (chicken and gyro meat) with spicy sauce and extra white sauce. The platter was mostly rice and lettuce. I normally like my food saucy, but I now I understand why everyone said to order extra white sauce. The food seemed dry and a little plain. The white sauce helped a lot. I will say, the hot sauce is SOO spicy. When I first saw them sparingly drizzle red sauce over my platter I thought they just being cautious; NO, it was spicy. Thank goodness they didn't add more.

"The reason this place gets one star is because THEY DON'T HAVE MIMOSAS! Upon sitting down and looking at the menu they have taped a notice over the mimosa portion of their menu saying they don't have a permit to sell mimosas. I don't know how long they have been open, or if they once had them, but they lose all integrity if they don't have the item they are named for. 

The reason this place could get two stars is because their food is decent. I tried their biscuits and gravy. They weren't my favorite because they were spicy and had a southwest taste to them, rather than your traditional home-style biscuits and gravy. I did not like that, but I could see other people liking that. I also tried their eggs benedict and their country potatoes. The eggs benedict was unremarkable. Their country potatoes, like the biscuits and gravy, were a little spicy and more southwestern, made with bell peppers and onions. I'm not opposed to this, but it should have been described in the menu better, as that was not the style I expected. I also did not care much for their coffee. I will say that their pancakes were amazing! Even though they were huge, they didn't have the too much like cake feel, and had a perfect crisp to the outside and the perfect consistency on the inside. Maybe the food would have tasted better with a mimosa? I'll never know.  

The reason this place doesn't get anymore stars is because the ambiance wasn't amazing. The decor is sunflower yellow colored walls with mediocre paintings of flowers. The service was good and the servers were nice, but nothing that stands out.

I got a small fruit shaved ice ($5.50 after tax). It came in a cup, not a bowl. I appreciate how there was a layer of red bean between the two layers of shaved ice. The fruits were diced strawberries and kiwis. There were also a couple chunks of injeolmi (soybean powder covered rice cakes) on top. The snow was powdery, which was delightful. It was also made with milk. I watched as milk was poured into the machine, so I'm assuming it was powdered milk snow that came out. While I'm a fan, I wish there was more condensed milk or some other kind of sweetener mixed into the ice itself. It wasn't sweet enough. When it was eaten with the red bean, it was sweet enough, but just barely.

Put me down as a fan of the cheesesteaks. Visited on a Friday around 12:45, where there was one person in line and a few groups seated and eating. The location is close to work and parking is not a problem in this plaza. Ordered the Phil Meal and got the poutine as well. 

The cheesesteak was awesome - the only regret I have is not ordering the Philthy size! There was a lot of steak, and it was easy to chew. The mushrooms, onions and peppers, provolone cheese as well as the Philthy sauce (much better than your regular bbq sace) made up for the slight lack of flavor on the steak. (edit: I got lettuce and tomato as well, but thought it didn't fit too with the cheesesteak and ate them on the side.) The poutine had plenty of cheese curds considering its size, and the fries did not seem overly oily. 

At 9.99 for a 6 inch cheesesteak, fries (+$2 for poutine) and a drink, you can't really go wrong (dare I say the value is Philthy?). I was hoping there was an option to upgrade the size of the cheesesteak similar to the fries, but it was a good mix of both of the main offerings.

Even as a fast food sit down spot, the service was attentive and friendly. I remember one person walking in and asking for recommendations and the staff carefully went over the menu with him. Will definitely return when I have a cheesesteak craving (similar to this visit).",1.0

Woke up to find my car missing out of my own apartment complex .  After calling the police they were able to track it down at this tow yard.  According to them my vehicle wasn't listed on my property list of approved vehicles for the lot so that's the reason they towed it. After I get there they make me wait outside in the hot sun for two hours until they got word from my property manager that they could release my vehicle without having to pay them $300. After my property manager finally got in touch with their so-called manager they gave me the car and what do I find? my seatbelt wrapped around my steering wheel six times and my entire driver seat covered with permanent black smudges everywhere!!! Already took my car in to a shop and they said the damage is irreversible. Hope these guys have fun in small claims court!,1.0

"Graft may be mistaken for just ""another farm to table"" restaurant around the square. I'd argue that maybe it should be labeled as THE farm to table restaurant around the square. Graft offers consistently good food, classy atmosphere,  great service,  and refreshing cocktails, all for a reasonable price. We have visited a few times now and never have we left disappointed.

One of the ways you know a restaurant is good is when you go there on week nights and you need a reservation. We didn't learn the first few times and waited for bar seats to open, but, now we get it. When you are seated you will notice no salt or pepper on the table. That's usually a clue that a restaurant is good as the chef is implying they will make the food just right and just how it should be tasted.

We have ordered nearly all of the most recent menu and remain impressed. Some highlights include the beef tartare, oyster po' boy, mussels, and Mac and cheese. They all hit the spot and provide a combination of flavor and texture. And, as the expectation is set, it is well appropriately seasoned.

Overall, definitely one of the winners of Madison dining. Hope you enjoy!",1.0
"This was our second trip to Edo. The first time we went, we waited for over five minutes for someone to acknowledge us before we finally gave up and left. This time we were able to get the attention of the hostess\/waitress and she led us to a table. She brought us water and menus. She seemed like she had a cold, so we're both hoping we didn't pick anything up.

We ordered sake, broccoli with garlic, the sashimi deluxe, salmon skin roll, oyster tempura roll and scallop nigiri. The broccoli w\/garlic was served with a sweet garlicky sauce. It was a pretty dish. The sauce was a little too sweet for me, but still a good dish. Although I ordered the Sashimi Deluxe, she brought me the Sushi Deluxe. I should have realized she had misheard me since she asked if Spicy Tuna was OK. I didn't realize till later that was one of the rolls offered with the Sushi Deluxe. I found the spicy tuna more salty than spicy and was not a fan. The sushi itself was quite good. The rolls however, were just OK, nothing special. The highlight was definitely the scallop nigiri.

The waitress disappeared for long periods of time. While we were waiting to get our bill, we noticed someone else who came in and stood by the cashier's desk for about 5 minutes before he eventually left. It reminded us of our first time there when no-one ever noticed us. Only two other tables in the restaurant had guests, but we could see that they did get a call or two, so maybe they have a bigger delivery business. Eventually our waitress brought the bill. However, it didn't appear she was going to come back to pick it up anytime soon. After a while I just took it up to the cashier's desk where she told me they were very busy.

The food was OK. The service could definitely be improved. We won't rush back as there are better sushi options in Madison.",1.0
"The doctors and staff seem perfectly competent, the ridiculous wait was a problem. I've been there 3 times in two months and two of those times required a wait of 2.5- 2.75 hours.  Clients are never told they could be waiting this long. The last time I mentioned they should consider calling the client 1\/2 hour before the appointment. The response was, ""We are short a doctor today."" Even more of a reason to let patients know there could be a longer wait. Had I known, I would have taken my dog to another vet. After almost 3 hours we had to leave.",1.0

If I had to sum up this place, I would say that it is a classy looking restaurant with a casual and friendly atmosphere.

The few times that I have been here, one of the managers - Adam would always come around and check on us a couple times throughout the meal to make sure everything was going well. He's got to be one of the friendliest people I've ever met. You can tell that he's a very family oriented person - he was very accommodating of our two sons and even went as far as helping us pack our leftover meals to go himself because we had our hands full. 

The menu is a 1 pager, but in my opinion - the best restaurant perfect the items on their limited menus! Their pizza is a hit with the kids, and their lobster bisque has got to be some of the best I've ever had. It's thick and has actual chunks of lobster in it, you can't beat it. 

I've had their Chicken Parmesan (which is a huge portion) and their carbonara with sunny side egg cracked on top (my favorite). I've never left this place hungry. 

They even give out pieces of dough for the kids to play with - they can create their own shapes and they'll bake it for you!

"GREAT experience with the optometrist! That was not an issue at all. It was the ""upsell"" of items when looking into purchasing glasses. AFTER insurance it was going to be $498 and change for a pair of glasses for my husband. We walked and shopped around. Same prescription - same price frames - same insurance - we paid $108 a couple blocks away. Anytime that I can save $390 dollars I am going to. 

They said the insurance covered the lenses - but not the material or the labor to make them into prescription needed.... so the difference was in how they broke down the charges. Seems shady and I won't trust them or be back again. I did this for convenience so husband could have the glasses before he had to leave town. Well - walking across the street - he had them back the next day and still before he left town.",1.0

The Truffle Parm Fries gave my mouth a bad taste & I wished that I  had a toothbrush to brush it off.  The inside of the fried fish was nice & flaky, but there was zero flavor.

By that point we had already decided what we were going to eat as well as drink. There were 3 other tables seated after us, all of which received their food before ours. We ordered a gyro and spanakopita, and 2 waters. our waitress finally came back to us and said that they burned the spanakopita therefore they had to remake it. She then came back a second time and said that there were onions and tomatoes in my gyro (which I had asked to please leave off due to an allergy), so they had to remake that. We FINALLY received our meals and my gyro meat was burned. It was burned so badly that it just shattered into crumbles when I was trying to pick those parts off.

But we eventually received a room upgrade with a view. It was really important to me with a great view too.

"Very disappointed in my meal last night. I ordered the ancho rubbed ribs after our waitress gushed on about how amazing they were....""meaty and fall off the bone tender"".  They were anything but.  The first bite I was unable to even chew, it was so hard and dry. The table knife provided was not sharp enough to separate the ribs. When I shared this with our waitress when she checked in with our table she said she was sorry and surprised as she had only heard good things about the ribs.  She willingly brought me a steak knife so that I could try cut  an individual rib. I'm not very assertive-I've never sent a meal back. I sure wish the waitress would have offered. I ended up eating just one rib and giving up.  To be honest, they tasted as if they had been warmed up from a previous day. That would explain the dryness. SO disappointing as I normally love this restaurant.",1.0

If you're here primarily for the food, it's not worth it. It's overpriced and doesn't fill you up but the presentation was beautiful. I got the Philly steak croissant and there was way too much cheese which made it difficult and messy to eat.

"This place is amazing and such a great place to eat and have fun!  It is very interactive as you cook your own food in a broth of your choosing and you get a pick selection of meats you can choose from and you get a bunch of vegetables with whatever meat you choose from.  

Also as an added bonus if you like more than one broth you can get both!  They give you a bowl that a a tray in the middle that separates the broths.  This place is good for groups but you are sitting at a bar so you will be sitting in a straight line no face to face so that is something to consider if you area trying to do a social outing.

"Portuguese tarts. My first was in Macau. I didn't appreciate it. I had one many years after, once I'd had what I like to call my ""foodie awakening"" and I regretted paying so little attention to my first. A friend of mine shared a Portuguese tart from Nova Era with me one day and it was delightful. The inside was wonderfully creamy and the crust was so incredibly flaky. It also wasn't too sweet, which I appreciated a lot. Be careful. If you aren't gentle with it, this dessert will fall apart when you bite it, but it's sooo worth it.",1.0

The Beef Shin with Yorkshire pudding took maybe half an hour to forty five minutes to cook, it was literally the shin of a cow, a huge bone with meat and marrow, we shared between 2-3 of us. The steak tartare was very fresh and delicious. The fries were covered in mozzarella and gravy, topped with bacon and eggs. Everything was seasoned, cooked and tasted great.

"Flannery is a name that any real Clevelander will recognize!

It's also right in the middle of tons of other restaurants and bars, which makes it a great location if you're wanting to bar hop. The food is pretty great as well, especially the fried cheese. The drink selection is standard, yet large and prices are fair. This bar also has an outdoor area where they serve beer for busier days. It can get rather loud inside, but obviously this is relative to what time you go to the bar and if there is a game going on downtown.

"Don't really know what to review about a mall so here goes nothing:

Great selection of stores and it seems to always be changing\/ going through new renovations\/ bringing on new retailers etc. It's a nice place to go if you're looking to get a gift but don't have a clue what to get someone. 

The new food court has some great new additions and looks nice! Though they have a LOT of people coming through everyday, so I think maybe they should have expanded the seating area... so many people have trouble finding a place to sit and just over all cleaning ediquette there is lacking, compared to other malls that are clear on how trays\/ trash should be treated after you're done eating...

They need serious security upgrades.. I've seen people just hanging out in the parking lots for an hour or two... don't know if they're waiting for someone to leave a car unlocked, or they just really like parking lots? There's been a few incidents, but nice to see they have security at the busiest entrances here.

They also should probably do some more cleaning... floors are often sticky..same with benches... and washrooms for sure. It's a busy mall, so they should really keep up!

It's a really busy mall usually with easy access from highway or local transit. Huge space with two floors and a theatre at the end there. Parking can be a nightmare, but just be patient.. people come and go all the time.

The ordering process is easy and fast, the employees are friendly, the space is clean and looks nice. I usually get the Tuna Mayo or the Chicken Bulgogi. Both (and I'd assume the same for the other cups) come with a bed of rice as the bottom layer, a layer of glass noodles in the middle, and the meat and other toppings on the top. The food is filling and very comforting. They also have samgak kimbap\/onigiri (rice triangles) with various fillings for sale, which are little heavy on the rice, but still taste great.

So he gave me a $5 coupon and told me to wait for them to return our pizza. UH, WHAT!!?? I was supposed to wait there while a stranger brings my pizza back that very likely had their hands all over it and probably ended up on some kids plate before they realized it was the wrong pizza.

First, when we called to place the order we were put on hold more than once. While we did have someone on the phone, the lady was laughing at us and chatting with a friend\/coworker at the same time. After requesting no mushrooms or onions on the entire order, it was delivered with mushrooms and onions on everything. When we called to make a complaint, ""your mom"" argued that we were wrong, stating ""we need to be more specific next time"". That's right, when we asked for her name her response was, ""your mom"". After listening to her tell us how WE placed the order incorrectly, we asked for her name again and she hung up on us. Calling back, she would answer and hang up even if from a different number.

THe entrees with chicken and sandwiches are amazing. The French fries are solid as well. They are a little thicker then I usually like but they made up for it with flavor and crispiness. The other thing I like is that their red wine by the glass is good. Their Justin Cab is reasonably priced and is a quality wine for just ordering  by the glass. Highly recommend eating here.  Great time. The other aspect is for drinks. Great night seen to just relax and have a couple of cocktails with friends or a business meeting.",1.0
"Very disappointed with my experience at 70 Down. We booked dinner for 5 people during Winterlicious for my mom's birthday. Our reservation was at 7 but upon arrival we were told that they were still getting our table ready. Not a big deal because my mom was running 10 minutes behind. When she got there we still weren't seated, which was weird because the restaurant only had two other parties in it - there were a lot of empty tables. When we asked again they said the table still wasn't ready. We waited until 7:30 before asking again and were told this time that they were waiting for another party to leave. Keep in mind the restaurant had a ton of empty tables they could have put us at and we had a reservation. Not only that but while we were waiting they seated a couple of 4 person groups that just walked in off the street. Overall it was a very negative experience. We ended up leaving and getting dinner elsewhere. I will not be returning to 70 Down.",1.0

"Auf unserer Rundreise haben wir h√§ufig die Restaurantkette In-n-Out Burger besucht, die mit dem Versprechen ""Quality You Can Taste"" wirbt. In Las Vegas , an der Sahara Avenue, sind wir eingekehrt, da die Filiale am Strip total √ºberlaufen ist. Im Internet konnte ich nachlesen, dass es das Unternehmen bereits seit 1948 gibt und es mittlerweile ca. 300 Restaurants im Westen der USA und Texas gibt.

Am sp√§ten Abend war hier der Andrang nur mittelm√§√üig. Die Auswahl war einfach, da es nur drei verschiedene Burger und Pommes zur Auswahl gibt. Wenn man es dann zur Bestellung geschafft hat, bekommt man eine Nummer, die dann aufgerufen wird sobald die Bestellung fertig ist.

Auf die Burger kommt nur gek√ºhltes und kein gefrorenes Frischfleisch, das von der eigenen Fleischfabrik innerhalb von 24 Stunden geliefert wird. Die Kartoffeln f√ºr die Pommes werden im Restaurant aus frischen Kartoffeln hergestellt. Ich konnte es selber in der offenen K√ºche sehen, wie ein Mitarbeiter die Kartoffeln gesch√§lt und gew√ºrfelt hat.

Preislich bewegt man sich trotzdem weit unten, da man auf eine umfangreiche Auswahl verzichtet. Wenn man mit mehreren Leuten hier einkehrt, sollten die anderen ein Pl√§tzchen im Restaurant sichern, da diese zu den Sto√üzeiten ebenfalls rar sind.

"We have stayed here twice now and each time specifically wanted the upgraded rooms in Tourette's at the hotel with the tub in it. These are premium rooms that you obviously pay more for. The first time we stayed in one of these rooms, the tub in the room above us overflowed and was leaking through the ceiling. So we had interrupt our Vegas fun to change rooms. We were compensated by the front desk with $20 of drink credit at the bars in the hotel.
Last night, we stayed here again. Once again, we upgraded to the room that has the tub. 
this time, the tub had not been properly cleaned by housekeeping and had a dirty footprint in it and shampoo all along the back of it. So here we were again, having to change rooms at Excalibur. The whole process was standing in line again at the front desk and talking to management there and then going to the new room took over an hour. It's very frustrating.

"Please beware of this company, they tried to pull a fast one on me and I admit they almost got me. Almost. 

My experience with them went as followed:

I needed rock to fill my un-landscaped backyard, this is a new home and only contains rubble. I gave this company a call, they came over to ""measure"" and then they gave me a quote of 15 ton for $1800. Yes, I thought this was reasonably priced as I had shopped around, so I agreed and signed the contract. Then went through HOA to get approved and everything was great. 

Now, the day comes when they are to place the rock in my backyard and he comes over early in the morning to ""measure"" again so he would know how much rock to order from the company he purchases it from. I suppose this should have been the red flag, considering they already MEASURED and QUOTED me for 15 TON. 

He then proceeds to tell me, 15 tons is not enough to cover everything and that I will instead need 21 tons and it will now be $600 extra, for a total of $2400. Please keep in mind this is my scheduled date for them to lay it down, so he tells me that he needs to know now so he can order the rock from the company so they can fill the truck and deliver it today, so then he can come in to lay it down. 

I ask him, how this happened and he told me that they actually never measured my back yard. I suppose they eyeballed it as if they were making a home cooked meal. To tell you the truth, I'm not really sure because I can't imagine how a landscape company didn't measure a backyard, yet gave me quote for how much rock I'd need to cover the property. He tells me that I have to pay this $600 if I want the whole yard covered, and that there is nothing he can do as that is what the rock will cost him in the first place for him to order 6 tons more. 

Now it's the day of, I need $600 extra, there is a short time frame for him to order it, and I have gone through the tedious task of going through HOA to lay rock by this company. If I don't do it by this company, I have to go through this process all over again when I've already reached the time frame I should have had it done by. Admittedly, I stupidly say yes.

The more I think about this and let this all seep in, I realize I'm very unhappy how this was conducted and that I feel like I'm being scammed. So, I call him back to tell him I'm unhappy and it went vastly downhill from there. He completely confirmed my feelings that he was scamming me by making the mistake of telling me that the rock cost him $1000 to purchase. Which is quite funny considering he said the extra 6 ton cost him $600 alone, I'm not a mathematician but that math doesn't quite add up. I also find out he is a partner in this company when earlier he made me feel like he was just a worker, then blames the whole measuring debacle on his partner since he was the one who ""measured"" and how it's not his fault. Apparently, measurement errors have happened before and sometimes you just need 6 tons more which is very concerning. Another thing, if he calls to cancel the truck, it will cost $200 since the truck is already on its way which he tells me I will have to pay. 

Excuse me sir, I really wish I had gotten your name, you said yourself you purchased the $1000 21-ton rock, that is not yet on my property, from this company with your own money therefor, it is yours. If a bill shows up in my mailbox for the cancelling of said rock, you will be hearing from my lawyer. I have a signed contract and text messages behind me, so it'll be a quick one. 

To future and or prospect customers I will leave you with this, he was going to charge me $2400 to lay down rock that only cost him $1000, after he lied about how 6 tons was going to cost him $600. If that wasn't enough, they scam you by coming the day of to say you need more rock due to a measurement error. Not very many people can afford hundreds of extra dollars on top of an already expensive purchase on the spot, so it's quite scary this has happened in the past. Please, please beware of this company, they will prey on you if they feel they can get away with it, they were very close to getting me.

"I was tired of my pool always looking dirty and our old pool company always forgetting to latch our back gate putting our dogs at risk to get out as we live close to a very busy road and this is a huge concern for us. I would visit my friends house and always be jealous how amazing their pool looked and felt. Our old pool company would often compensate for poor work by showing up on their scheduled day (Friday) and throwing so much chlorine in the water that is was not enjoyable for my familly to play in on the weekends basically rendering our pool worthless. 

Finally I fired Poolman and hired AZ Clear Pools. They always latch my gate, my pool is amazing, my floor and walls are finally clean and the Pool is not continously over chlorinated for the weekend so the family is very happy. As for their prices, their service is more affordable than my old service +++ If you are a short minded bargain hunter there are some others  they are perfectly priced when actually comparing them to a pool service that has the tools, resources, and knowledge to save you thousands down the road. The cheaper companies are ussually just some burnout with a brush and believe me I will never fall for a ""cheaper service"" ever again.

I put very detailed instructions on the service envelope regarding the two things I needed completed. The first was a recall and I enclosed the letter I received in the service envelope. This seemed fairly straightforward.


The second thing I asked to have done was to clear a check engine light related to an emissions problem. I put the code related to the problem, described what work had already been done to rectify it, and what I believed to be the current issue (a dead wire or fuse). I even put additional notes on the back of the envelope outlining my awareness of the other light that was on (related to needing rear brakes, which I was not ready to have done at this visit). I felt this was all very clear. If it was unclear, someone should have called me at the start of business before serving my car.


I called the service department at 2pm on that Thursday to check progress. I was patched through to the service department but no one answered. I left a message asking to get a call back. No one called me until after 4pm (close to closing) and instead of the expected call to say the work was done, someone asked me for more information about the check engine light. I repeated everything that was written on the service envelope.¬†


Why would it take two days to complete this? My car was in a bay and was serviced for the recall, so why wasn't I called then to get more information to handle the check engine light? I use my vehicle for work and had to pay for three cab rides as a result of what I consider an inefficient communication and a waste of valuable work time. I was definitely not satisfied with that aspect of the service I received. I honestly had not planned to return in the future due to this reason and would not recommend this location.",1.0
this is the worst hoa possible.. they are all new in the office and not one of them have a clue to what they are doing.. the owners pay these people hoa dues just so they can send notices about weeds the the wrong tenants... they are rude as hell and i have neighbors that they are allowing to live in the community that have had no utilities for 3 weeks now because the unit is supposivly being sold.. their trash is piled up to the walls and they have rats.. all the 10 kids that live here are filthy and it smells like something died when they open their front door.. the kids use the outside faucet water for cup od noodles and plug in extension cords to all the neighbors outlets to use their microwave.. and yes the hoa and the onsite hoa lady are all aware.. trashy complex and no one cares... i cant wait till my lease is up so i can get the hell out of this rat whole.  beware cause camco dont care!,1.0
"Huge cleanliness issues with the vehicles, poor customer service. Sadly it's just a matter of time. This isn't the first time we've rented a car and it's been very dirty. How difficult is it to have someone go around to maintain your vehicles??? I mean they charge a fee for everything else. And no one ever lives up to 1-2 business days committed for follow up.

The company takes no account for personal belongings and forces workers to leave them in a break room.  The supervisor refuses to accept keeping watch over items left under her watch and care as her responsibility.  I had safety items stolen and two supervisors and two offices refuses to take responsibility or acknowledge this makes for an unsafe work environment.  They say 'we don't let people steal' as an answer to letting people steal.",1.0

I've been coming here now for about 2 years now and I can't say how great the food is! Not only is the food great but the staff and owner are so nice. I gave this place a 5 star because there has never been a time that I've ordered food here and not loved it. Everything I've had here is great. I would definitely recommend this place to satisfy your  mediterranean craving.,1.0
"Outstanding items, people, and service structure at EJs. I found out about them within the year and glad to patronize them locally. Found, many, great items. They lower the BP if you attend live so that helps. All staff have been great.

"THIS PLACE IS AMAZINGGGG!!!!! 

One of the few (like 3) 100% vegan restaurants in the Charlotte area! And I must say, this one ran neck and neck with Bean cuisine for awhile, but Zizi's takes the cake!!! Or cheesecake shall I say! Because that's what makes this place #1, the cheesecake here is OUT OF THIS WORLD!!! It was soooo good a friend and I went back 2 days in a row and another time later that week! And every time we went we had like 2 slices each!! (Crazy right?? No it's really that good!!) and as a vegan it's so hard to find a delicacy like this and it actually taste like the ""real thing"" (and yes I used delicacy because...well IT IS!!! Try it!) and for a price you can't beat!! 



I'm making it my business to try everything on the menu and will come back with an updated review 

But so far I've had 
""Chicken"" parm- FABULOUS!! (Try it with veganaise) 
""Chicken"" Phillly -GOOD
""Philly"" -GREAT
falafel wrap- FANTASTIC 
Mac and cheese - INCREDIBLE 
Cheesecake- OUT OF THIS WORLD (duh)
Fries - GOOD (can't go wrong with seasoned fries) 
They're hummus is yum, and so is their vegan mayo which is made there!! 

The atmosphere there is so enlightening!! I swear I learn something new about plant based foods every time I go! Almost every wall has a flyer, poster, or quote that's so enlightening. 


Seating. Now space is definitely limited. A few stools inside, and a table and 2 chairs which is sometimes outside. But I mean it's a take out place so it's meant to do just that! 

Timing. Just being honest, don't think you're going to walk in there place your order get your food and leave. This isn't fast food. No. You can't rush perfection!! So call in 15-20 in advance! Everything is made fresh and trust me it's worth it !! Just go on in, ring the bell and bam someone is at your service. 

But really... ring the bell (coming from experience) because sometimes someone is not always at the front. 

But overall to conclude this essay I would totally recommend this place!!! I have no complaints nor have I ever had a negative experience.. the employees are always so friendly and really seem to care about what they do!  

So give it a try!!! Vegan or not 
But really GO VEGAN!!",1.0
"I can't stand vegas but this hotel makes it a better experience. Beautiful rooms and if you book thru Marriott (yes) you earn points and upgrade eligibility based on your Marriott status. I've stayed here about 5 times and upgraded every time despite major conferences going on at hotel ( weekdays). Casino is dance, nice chandler bar center stage, everything is reasonable close so your not exhausted walking a vast property. Balcony with great views ( ask to face Bellagio so u can see the water show from your room). Great restaurants..ate at four while there..for a great traveler I'd suggest Eggslut for breakfast and a must find spot on 3rd floor called secret pizza....probably the most affordable best food on the strip. Only complaint my toilet in room was broken I called and it was never serviced so I listened to it run water for days...and left my $50 hot iron in room but now lost and found says it wasn't turned in. My fault but it wasn't turned in.",1.0
Pretty awesome aquarium with lots of sharks and crazy looking fish as well. Only bad part is when you first walk in it's really hot and uncomfortable so we hurried up through that but the best part is at the end with all the sharks and the tank that you go through and sharks are swimming over you. Buy the 57$ pass where you can go to two other attractions in other casinos as well to save some money if your going with family. Pretty fun place!!,1.0
"After working late on a Wednesday night and feeling guilty that I was part of the reason that Sophie M missed an evening workout elsewhere, I called this OTF studio to schedule us both for a 6am class the next morning.  Sophie hadn't been to any Orangetheory studios before, and while I had, this was my first visit to this specific studio.

We showed up early the next morning to fill out our paperwork and get ready for our workout.  We were warmly greeted by Katie, who was very thorough with informing us about the upcoming class, the studio, etc...  We got set up with loaner heart rate monitors and were ready to go!  It's worth noting that this studio is more spacious than some of the others I've been to and very clean as well.  

We also lucked out and scored treadmills next to each other to start, thanks to another attendee giving up her's so we could be together.  (At other studios I've visited, the other clients are not always so generous).

The class we took was hard core, and we both enjoyed it.  Taylore is an excellent instructor.  She took time to make sure we understood the instructions for every exercise and checked in with us throughout the class.

I learned afterwards that OTF now offers class packages that are good at any studio for a year.  I'll likely purchase one of these to diversify my other workouts.  Thanks again Taylore, for a kick-ass first workout at this location... I'm sold!",1.0
"Visiting from Canada and came to T-Mobile arena to see the Imagine Dragons concert so we didn't know what was in the arena for food. Obviously we wanted to try something we couldn't get at home. Finally found this gem. We ordered the typical burger, the chicken sandwich, fries and their vanilla icecream. For being in an arena this food was delicious. I thoroughly enjoyed the quality beef and the chicken was also great. Fries and icecream were nothing fancy. But the sandwiches were great. Glad they had this option at the arena. Only problem I had was the service was a little weak, almost everyone's order was messed up, usually missing something. I had to go back for my drink cause they forgot that. But overall definitely worth it. Surprisingly not bad for price either.",1.0
I researched several companies and was referred to Allied Iron by my neighbor.  From start to finish the entire process was handled professionally. I started by going to the showroom and talked to designer.  After a few weeks of thought made choice and purchase.  Allied made it all simple and gave me a great price. Communication was very good and the installation was perfect.  Couldn't be more happy with my choice to use Allied Iron.  Already referred my neighbor who bought a new door also.,1.0
"I purchased a jeep from a guy and noticed after getting home,(70 miles later), I had a ton of transmission fluid all over the underside of the jeep. I dropped it off and after checking the transmission, transfer case, test driving it, me test driving it, it wouldn't leak anymore and ran fine. Turns out, it was most probably overfilled from the previous owner. 

Tony explained into detail how transmissions on these jeep work, and really took the time to try and figure out the problem. I was prepared to spend $1500 to have it fixed, but because TONY IS HONEST AND HAS INTEGRITY, he didn't charge me because he couldn't find a problem. A lot of other places would've ""found"" an issue and gladly took my money.

"This place is SO underrated. I absolutely love this sushi place! The location isn't the best because it can be tricky to find it (if you're a first timer). But there are boba places all over this area, so that's convenient. 

Whatever nigiri you order, you will always get small amount of rice and a long, thick piece of fish. It's cold and fresh. You'll never get their type of portion elsewhere. I've tried different sushi places (some out of state) and none are like Neko! One thing I dislike is how limited their desserts are. You can only choose ONE out of the choices :( It used to not be like that, but they recently changed it. Hoping it will change back! 

The service here is mediocre. It really depends who you get, but the majority of them are very kind and patient. There was only one horrible server, but I think she got fired. Most of the days I come, they aren't busy at all so the food comes out fairly quick.

"This place is as ""human"" as it can possibly get.  I previously had a bad experience and Mike cleared it up.  He told me one of his worker's was simply having a bad day and long story short it was bad timing for his worker and me.  Needless to say it was my first time experiencing something like that at this shop when before it was nothing but smooth sailing.

Mike apologized on behalf of the employee and so did the employee.  I get it, we're all human and make mistakes.  As far as business goes, I trust this place.  It was recommended to me from Carmax which is as trustworthy as it gets.  I have an older vehicle with lots of mileage and try to avoid having to lease or buy a new car to not have another unnecessary payment (being as I'm a soon to be new Father).  

The staff here are on it and I appreciate the timeliness and fair pricing they have.  I don't get ""upsold"" like I normally would at other dealerships or take my car in for an oil change and then 2 weeks later find out something is up w\/ my car due to some set up that may have been done.  I really appreciate the guys here and if you're wondering what mechanic shop to trust, this is it!

Nice wine selection as well.",1.0

Also, if you have questions about the thickness of the meat cuts (I'm weird) they always answer or adjust. Good customer service! Also, I like that they acknowledge and speak to my little 5 year old when I come in. I hate when places ignore a kid trying to say hi.",1.0
"Nice place for some Korean shaved ice dessert. Seats are first come first serve. The place isnt too big. If you have a large group, like 4+ people, it may be tough getting a seat when it's busy. Having said that, it'a much bigger than the one in north York. 

Ordered injeolmi,  black sesame, and blueberry shaved ice. Injeolmi was my favorite out of the three. It's your standard Korean shaved ice flavor. Can't go wrong with it. Black sesame was also good. Blueberry was ok. It's topped with frozen blueqberries and cheesecake bits. 
There are plenty other flavors on the menu to choose from so you'll certainly find something worth trying. 

Word of recommendation. People standing around are eyeing your table when it's busy. So don't make eye contacts with them if you want to sit and chill just a bit longer.",1.0
"This is my go to Nail salon in Vegas and Henderson. From my personal experience, I have not found a better place for nails. I only ever come in for a pedicure about every 2\/3 weeks depending on how fast my nails grow. A regular pedicure is $30 which is a little more than the average nail salon, but I think it is worth it for the customer service provided and the ambiance. 

This place is definitely very busy and popular!! If you want to come here, I would recommend making an appointment at least a day in advance, but they usually do a great job at accommodating walk ins. Color selection is unbeatable for regular polish and gel! 

They have brand new massage chairs that are very comfortable and use sanitary materials as well. I have probably had services done by every nail technician and they all do a great job, but sometimes the process can be inconsistent from technician to technician. 

The only thing I sometimes mind about this location is that they're very pestering with the up-sell. They will ask you 10 times if you also want a manicure with your pedicure, if you want gel, or if you want your eyebrows done. Also, it's always very hectic in there and it's very evident that the employees are stressed out. It makes it difficult for me to relax when they are all running around frantically. It also seems they like to raise their prices, so beware if you are trying to save money. 

Despite this, I regularly recommend this salon to all of my friends and would recommend it to anyone who asks!",1.0
"I visited T&T Auto today and I felt so compelled to write about my experience. 

The reviews are all true, this body shop is great. I came in needing my headlight bulbs replaced.

Tao helped me the whole time. He was super nice and had me out in less than 20 minutes! Being a girl, my whole life that I've ever needed to take my car to a body shop, I always felt like I was being taken advantage of because of my gender. I did not feel that way today.

"DISCLAIMER DO NOT TAKE THEIR PENS  

First off I want to say thank you to Dmytro and Yoshwa for staying late to finish up my sale. This was the most pleasant car buying experience you could pretty much ask for. I viewed their used car inventory online and seen one that caught my eye. Dmytro was diligent with getting back to me and scheduling a test drive. 

Before going in I called my bank and was approved with a 5.6 interest rate. I went in and was greeted, and introduced to Dmytro, who was kind and easy to talk to. The car was ready to be viewed and test driven. I liked the car, and the price was right. Dmytro did everything in his power to get me to walk out with the car I wanted, but I had also scheduled a test drive over at ""Friendly"" Ford. I received a call from Ford while I was debating signing. I figured I should do myself justice by checking out the car at Ford before making a decision. I was introduced to Curt, a manager, before leaving the dealership who was equally as pleasant.

I drove to Ford and they informed me that they sold the car I wanted to look at. They insisted I look at other cars which I refused, and the sales lady actually begged me to come inside, but I quickly departed back to VW. 

It was close to 8:15 at night (they close at 9pm) and i was ready to make a deal. Dmytro insisted he could get me a better APR than my bank. He ran my credit and was approved at a 3.99 APR  (which ended up being my actual APR)  I signed some paperwork and began speaking to Yoshwa in financing. He was funny guy, transparent with all of numbers we had went over, and very professional.  At the nights end it was close to 11 pm and I was driving off in my CPO 2014 Jetta S Sedan. I will be going in for all future maintenance. Ask for Dmytro and Yoshwa I guarantee you'll have a good car buying experience.

Wings came out relatively fast and they are actually really big!  My favorite flavor was the hot honey garlic. A little spicy and a little sweet. The chipotle bbq was sweet as well. I liked it but I'm not sure if chipotle is supposed to be sweet or not.   I was expecting something a little more savory and Smokey. The garlic Parmesan was also good but it got a little heavy towards the end. I'm glad we had other flavors to break up the taste. 

I will definitely come back here again as wings are big and well priced and the flavors are pretty good!",1.0
Food was absolutely delicious. The loaded nachos was amazing. Minor point I would have added a much meat to it. Spouse had the jack fruit enchiladas and the flavor was phenomenal and the beans and rice were perfection. His minor point is having a slightly larger serving considering he his a skinny thing. He also added a juice to his meal that he really enjoyed. Service is terrific.  Now to check out the dessert bar.  We will be back here again to dine.,1.0

"Peru Chicken - Las Vegas, NV

Peru Chicken is not just good, their rotisserie chicken is really, really good.  Peru Chicken might just be my favorite place for rotisserie chicken in Las Vegas.  Each chicken meal comes with a side, but ordering a la carte is an option too.  Price for a half chicken is only $6 and it's more than enough food to keep me happy for a few hours.  The chicken is seasoned to perfection, very tasty, big on meat, and simply delicious.  I have also tried other items on their menu, including their saut√©ed beef and even a side of hotdogs.  You can't go wrong with those dishes too.  But if you ask me, it's all about their chicken.  

The restaurant is located off Sahara and can easily be missed if you're not specifically looking for it.  There's one TV and it's usually set on ESPN Deportes.  The restaurant is small and the staff is as nice as can be.  Bottom line...you get a lot of good food for your money at Peru Chicken.

"Didn't have the greatest experience at this restaurant. Given I went on the first day of being hot, the patio filled up. We were really hungry so we decided to eat inside. 

Although we sat near some of the light source of the restaurant it was pretty dark and very loud music, at one point I could even hear them turn it up even louder where I found it hard to talk to my girlfriend who was sitting right next to me.

From time of order it took a long time for us to get our food, I'd say around 45 mins. We just sipped on our waters and waited.

With all that said, the food. Tbh I was hungry so I thought it was okay. I got the Mexican Dirty Rice and others in my party got the Wet Burrito and the Chicken Chimichanga. If anything I would say all the food kinda tasted the same with minute taste distinctions and different textures. I kinda felt that the wet burrito was just my Mexican Dirty Rice in a wrap. 

Another note to add is that I feel adds if the food is overpriced for the portions you get, taste doesn't really make up for it. The wet burrito and Chicken Chimichanga were both $16 without tax\/tip and the Mexican  Dirty Rice was $13 without tax\/tip.

"Went to Lee's for a work function, so my comments are specifically related to the food, service and atmosphere, while I won't comment on cost. We had the 6 course tasting menu that was served with an amuse bouche to start and included the famous slaw salad, fish, octopus, chicken, lamb and a trio of desserts. 
Firstly, the service is top notch. The balance is perfect between keeping it upmarket, without letting first timers feel uninformed or out of place. Even the sommelier was great at giving a balanced set of options and explanation of pairings. 
Secondly, presentation. You know you are in a top notch restaurant when they don't overwork the presentation at every opportunity, but rather give a visually stunning dish fit for impressing a date or marking a celebration. 
And then the food. The dishes were exquisite, with excellent variety and bold flavours. I feel like some of the sides were hit or miss and did not always stand up to brilliantly executed focus of each dish (the ""potato salad"" was sufficiently underwhelming to draw comments of disappointment from the table). 
Best meal of my life? Probably not, but it is pretty damn close and you can't go wrong here.",1.0
"Okay, I've been rooting for Little Nipper's for years - against the snooty service and high prices at neighoring Bado's (plus, Nipper's pizza is better), but I think I'm done.  I've been there about 6 times in the past year with my kids to dine in.  Never once has there been more than ONE other table occupied, and never once has there been someone in the dining room to greet us.  We always feel awkward and question if they're open, and then we finally just sit and wait and eventually someone will come out from the back.  I think there is one cook, based on what I've seen and how long it takes for our food to come out.  Maybe all their business is in delivery; but in that case they should have more than one cook.  Nipper's just redecorated the interior and exterior of their restaurant, but they just never appear ready for actual customers.",1.0
"I really like this sushi spot! Lots of variety and they have different kinds of food options on their menu whether you are craving Sasha, Korean pork bone soup, or stir fry they have it all. I came here on a late Monday evening around 10pm after a movie night with my boyfriend and to our surprise this place is actually opened until 11:30 and not 9:30pm (score!). 

Giving taste and portion 5\/5 
Atmosphere 4\/5 

Taste and portion 5\/5 - We ordered the sushi combo (highly recommend) for $39 and a rainbow roll. The combo was such a great deal (see my photo) should have opted for the larger one instead of adding a rainbow roll. I'm in love with raw scallop sashimi and salmon and this place has it done right! Quite generous on the sashimi slices and was very very full. I also love all the side dishes they give you typically at a Korean restaurant AND we get soul and salad also. 

Atmosphere 4\/5  - parking is a bit of a hassle here since there is no parking right in front of the building. You have to park around the corner inside the plaza complex and walk around to the restaurant which was no biggie for us but maybe not ideal for those who are not able to access places as easily. The decor is okay here except for the creepy red dim light in the middle of the restaurant on the ceiling. They could do some sprucing up on the furniture as the seats in the booths were starting to show tear.",1.0
"Tamed, low key, and a great place to bring your friends for a few drinks. I would say the crowd is also on the mature side. The rooftop patio is nice and airy, and illuminated with Christmas lights. 
Our server was super attentive, always made sure we have everything we needed rather it's food or booze.

"Cleaner than most cabs
They come and collect you instead of waiting on a cold or wet street.
Because all of the drivers are their own business owners essentially, they are motivated to create a clean and pleasant experience. Unlike some yelpers I've only had one bad experience. One guy who went through a stop sign and then blamed me (to the cop) by saying that I was in a rush. He then was so nervous that he went through another red light. I put it down to being young and stupid. Seems to be a generational thing.
Other than that service is spectacular.
They also use gps to take the most efficient route.

"Yum Dam Cha, Sik Koh Baw

What did I get
Some of everything! Dim Sum plates. I got the Shu Mai, Chicken Feet, Beef Tripe, Cow Tendons, Pork Ribs, Tofu Curd Rolls. Everything was as expected but the beef tripe was a bit tasteless for me, needs a bit more spices please! Also got a plate of stir fried veggies with garlic, also would be great if they stir fried the garlic and not just top it off with garlic (no to garlic breath)

Environment
Very big restaurant, lots of space. The ladies come around with the carts of Dim Sum and you can pick and chose. You could also see all the bakery items near one side of the wall. Typical space, nothing special. OH! The bathroom signs are hilarious.....

Niceness of staff
Um... nothing special. They weren't rude nor were they super friendly. I think with language barrier it is a bit difficult. Mostly they just want to serve you food and move on...

Dollar
Small plates... about $4 a pop! Gets pricey once you start adding up! I was with another person and the bill was about $40, I wouldn't say I was full

Yes?

"Amazing!! I couldn't have asked for more! I booked Split Second for my wedding ceremony and reception. The service I received from my first conversation up until the actual wedding day was perfect. Everyone at Split Second that I encountered was friendly and professional. They did a great job setting me up for the perfect day ahead of time. They have a web portal where you can enter all the details of your big day -including information about you and your spouse, average age of guests, requested songs and even your timeline of the day. This made the day of go so smoothly! I loved them and my guests loved them. 
In addition to the DJ services, I signed up for th Bride Concierge package. Lauren was absolutely phenomenal. She was a huge help on our wedding day - she assisted with decorations, setup and breakdown. I didn't have to worry about a single detail. I couldn't have made it through the day without her!

"As someone who enjoys a good burrito I was curious when I saw that a branch of M4 Burritos was opening downtown close to where I work.  In addition to burritos they also offer burrito bowls, and tacos.  It sometimes gets compared to Chipotle but having never tried that chain I can't comment on that.  It is pretty similar to Quesada, another burrito chain, which also happens to have a location a stone's throw away from this one.

Since burritos are the main focus of this place it made sense to get one so I got a pork burrito and added tortilla chips and and a drink to make it into a combo.  So how was the food?  Well as a whole I was left feeling underwhelmed with my meal.  The pork was dry and everything in general seemed to be quite bland.  I added spicy salsa to my burrito but it wasn't spicy at all.  Even the tortilla chips were stale and could have used some more salt.

The prices also could have been better.  If you just get a basic burrito it isn't so bad but if you start getting extras like guacamole then the price can start to climb pretty quickly.  They charge over $2 just for guacamole which is a tad steep given how other places don't charge so much for those kinds of extras.  My combo was $13 and I have to say that given the quality of the food I feel like it was overpriced.  If you're a student make sure you bring your student ID with you because you can show it for a 10 % discount.

With Quesada up the street on McGill campus I doubt I'll be back here.  The experience leaves a lot to be desired and I feel like I can get better value for my money elsewhere.",1.0

"L'√©picerie Hao est un vrai bijou √† Montr√©al. Parmi les bonnes adresses qu'offre d√©j√† la ville, j'ajoute et recommande sans h√©siter cette boutique pleine de charme. Je m'y suis rendu avec cinq amis de New York, tous justes arriv√©s √† Montr√©al. Pour nous, cette visite a marqu√© le d√©but d'un excellent week end. 

Il s'agit d'un petit "" resto "" avec un d√©cor impeccable et un service superbe. Ce n'est pas n√©cessairement un choix id√©al pour l'accueil d'un grand groupe car il n'y a pas de tables. On y mange attabl√©s √† des comptoirs longeant les murs. Heureusement, nous avons eu de la chance car personne n'√©tait l√† sauf nous, donc nous √©tions seuls pour profiter des lieux. Tenue par deux fr√®res et une s≈ìur, cette petite √©picerie offre une ambiance intimiste et moderne. Nous avons vraiment appr√©ci√© de discuter avec Rachelle qui est une h√¥tesse tr√®s agr√©able.

Le menu peut para√Ætre un peu limit√©, mais cela me convenait bien car je pr√©f√®re les restos sp√©cialis√©s pour certaines choses\/plats. Quelques personnes sur Yelp pr√©tendent que 10$ est un peu cher pour deux buns vapeur, mais apr√®s en avoir mang√© deux, nous √©tions rassasi√©s. J'ai essay√© des buns au porc et des buns v√©g√©tarien. Ces derniers, en particulier √©taient incroyablement d√©licieux et avaient plusieurs saveurs diff√©rentes. Normalement je pr√©f√®re la viande, mais √† ma prochaine visite, je commanderai des buns v√©g√©tarien sans h√©siter. De plus, la pr√©sentation √©tait parfaitement ex√©cut√©e telle une oeuvre d'art, comme beaucoup de plats sur ce site.. Dans l'ensemble, nous avons vraiment eu une excellente exp√©rience √† l'√©picerie Hao et j'aimerais beaucoup y revenir !",1.0
"Husband found this place, so we decided to try it out on our way home from a weekend in the city. Definitely use the NoWait app if you go on a weekend or else you can have up to a two hour wait. 
Husband had Breakfast Magic. He said that it was good, but egg was quite small, and it could've used more sauce. 
Daughter and I shared the Funky Monkey. It was very good. The peanut butter topping was delicious. Could've used some more chocolate sauce, but we made up for that by using some of their syrup. Also had bacon, and it was delicious!
Son had Fosters waffle, and it was amazing! I think it was the best order at the table. It was like dessert for breakfast since it was topped with ice cream and cinnamon. 
Wait staff was friendly and efficient.

"There was a time when I would have given them 5 stars, after last night I am sorry to say that I will stop recommending Andrews as the best steak house in the burgh. We took our son and dil with us, out of the four meals two were good. My husbands med steak was barely cooked, they took it back and cooked it some
More and it still was bleeding all over the plate. We waited until after our salads to get the bread.. when we first started going to Andrews they would scrape the crumbs from the table, the prices stayed the same but the service has gone so far down hill. Our waitress did an ok job but I was not in an ok job kind of place.. if you are paying top dollar you should get really good service and food. I had the crab cakes, they honestly were not worth eating. The best part of the meal was the cranberry bread, I am not a bread fan but I absolutely love the bread. We probably won't be going back for a while but we will try again at a later date in hopes that the food and service went back to the way it once was.",1.0
"Can't undervalue an opportunity to tell the truth about a place we had just visited, the Shit Pot. Correction, I think the sign outside reads Noodle Pot so I guess we will go by that for now. This evening we came in a party of three and ordered spicy wonton, beef noodle soup and port chop rice and I will go over each one of them in detail. Spicy wonton - slightly below average. Beef noodle - they give you enough noodle though we didn't like the texture (had have better else where). Broth was extra ordinary while beef was okay and nothing special. And here comes the naked truth. I think people appreciate honesty and I will be perfectly honest: the pork chop was NO DOUBT the WORST WE (PARTY OF 3) HAVE EVER HAD IN OUR LIVES. Can you imagine how hard that is? It's bad enough be the worst one has ever had but a party of 3!!!??? It was SUPER, SUPER DRY, TASTELESS not to mention thin. I think it's fair to say we controlled ourselves well and were nice enough not to return that crap after our first bites. I think you can go to an Italian, American, Vietnamese or even the cheapest buffet in town and they will have to ability to present a better fried pork chop than this one. And there were those corns. You might as well not serve them given the amount that was on the plate. How cheap you get? It's even worse than kids meals. And of course there were the two piece of broccoli's and how generous of you as we were just in tears to have those pieces on the plate. Decor was boring and service was nothing. Wonton and beef probably deserve two to three star but the pork chop is no doubt in the negative territory thus one star as we don't know if there is a way we can grade this pot place any lower. All three of us were mad that such an inferior product was presented to us (port chop) let alone to even try it. ALL THREE OF US WILL NEVER RETURN! Oh here, here is a ""Grand Opening"" sign outside. How long have they been opened? Just like the pork chop - you might be able to trick and get away with some but it's honestly very low class and disrespectful to serve such a dish and the customers have to pay $8.50 + tax & tip to get trash.",1.0

We stopped in after a local event and wanted to enjoy some wine and pizza.  We first asked for a margherita pizza but then changed our order to pepperoni.  What we received was a plain cheese pizza with no flavor whatsoever.  When I asked about the pizza, our server told us that was their margherita pizza.  I first reminded her that we changed our order to pepperoni but then I went on to explain that we only got a cheese pizza.  She tried to tell me that's how they make margherita pizzas in Italy.  Umm...no it's not.  She did take the pizza off the bill so that was a plus; however, the bill was still extremely high. I've never seen house wine cost that much but whatever.  Service wasn't great.  Pizza wasn't good.  Wine was overpriced.  Location is great.  I may return to give them another try and I may not, especially since there are so many options in the area.",1.0

"If you have a free day and no set itinerary, I would definitely check this place out (there are many locations all along the Strip) for discounted show tickets.  It's a practical way to save $$$ but the catch is that they can only be purchased day before \/day of performances. 

They are located on the first level of Fashion Show Mall next to entrance close to Sugar Factory.   I would recommend checking screens for show tickets available as well as times offered. They will display prices also. Tickets are on a first come, first serve basis and based on how many are released . The day we came here, we were on the fence on a few shows but decided on one where the time and date worked for us.

I am very glad we split one, because as he was making the shake there were about 5-6 large scoops of ice cream. The presentation is stellar with lots of fudge ripples in the cup and then drizzled on top of the bark and whip cream. The shake was tasty with the cheesecake flavor really coming through. It was just very thick and sweet. Their bark wasn't that great and we just ended up throwing that out. I think it would be good if they made different sizes as their standard size is pretty big.

There are quite a few tables both 2-person and one that will seat eight. There are also stools for working at a counter. Two comfortable sofas and one chair allow for a relaxing meeting area for friends.

I think one of the walls is painted a light avocado green which gives the coffee shop a retro feel. The ceiling is the usual silver exhaust pipes on a matte black background. Pink lighting gives off a warm tone.

"This place uses fresh, quality ingredients to create meals with high nutritional value without sacrificing flavor. On separate visits I've had their PH chopped salad, the PH burger, and the PH protein pancake combo; I enjoyed every one of those items and it was also comforting to know that I was getting a good dose of protein (this place is great for after-workout meals, obviously) without the significant amounts of fat that would normally be found in those items' counterparts in other restaurants. Even my PH protein pancake combo came with only 3 grams of fat, but a whopping 39 grams of protein. The service is very friendly and the dining space itself is very clean with a simple modern aesthetic. Syrups (maple and agave), organic ketchup and the like are available at the condiment bar area. The high nutritional value of the meals and the high quality of the ingredients used to prepare them means that you will pay a bit more, but considering everything - the nutritional balance, the flavors, the service, the atmosphere - it is definitely worth it.",1.0

"Unfortunately, when I was in grad school, I rented from Lobos on Kamin Street in Squirrel Hill. While the apartment was very nicely priced, (especially compared to the D.C. Metro Area pricing I am now dealing with) I experienced shocking slumlord-style management.

I'm glad I can laugh about it now, because it was infuriating at the time, but being awakened by a clawing raccoon hiding in your walls made me not very happy. This went on for more than a month, and I was not given any solutions other than to sleep at friends' places. There were traps set up in my apartment room, making it impossible to inhabit while the pest control workers came in and out. Did I mention it was also the dead of winter, which is apparently why this creature was looking for shelter within the walls of the apartment building?

Once one of the workers had the idea to check to see if the ""chimney had been capped"" (which it had not, and which ended up being the ultimate issue) the problem was solved. For such a simple, silly problem, it really seemed ridiculous to put a tenant through what I had been through with barely a squeak of an apology. I lost countless hours of sleep and dealt with phone call after bothersome phone call. Try explaining to people that there are noises coming from within your walls. It has to be the most horrifying tenant experience I've had to date - knocking on wood - ever.

The street tacos are so well thought out! It's Mexican classics with Asian influence. I ordered the following tacos: Korean fried chicken, shredded beef crunchy, and avocado tempura. The best one was the crunchy beef, hands down! Everyone else also really enjoyed their tacos.

"Our family weekend started out fantastic at the beautiful elara Hilton. Fantastic rooms and friendly service. That is until you have a small request. Our 4 year old son was not feeling well after eating something bad at the miracle mile. We kindly asked if we could extend our check out an hour past 10am to 11 am.. (not an unreasonable request esp. because most all hotels and resorts I've ever stayed at are ok with that) we were then given the ""there is no exception response and were told we would be charged accordingly if we were to be late checking out."" We felt rushed to leave the room while my son was crying out of discomfort. Our perfect family weekend turned into a nightmare with a sick child, a very miserable wife and me having to deal with everything. We then realized that the elara staff showers people with fake smiles and false pretense of friendliness.  The staff cares about nothing and nobody. I'd be surprised if the young front staff had any children.  Any parent would have understood the true situation. Not kid \/ family friendly. Great place to stay if you like fake staff and you don't run into any issues on your stay .. After a few days I calmed down but then received a phone call from the supervisor (Michael Garcia) and received again an apology and a ""there is nothing we can do"" answer.. why even call? It just made me even more mad again! Elara hotel is nice.. staff is trash and deserves a 0 star review",1.0
"I waited and waited for this new place to open. Very disappointed. Great atmosphere, TVs a plenty, loud music and the staff was so friendly and attentive but the food was no good.

I'm sad because I had such high hopes for this place. I might give it another try only because our server was so amazing. I think her name was Mary. She was definitely on top of things. For the price of the food it should be great and it's bland.",1.0
"I went with the Luckee Har Gow, Luckee Shrimp Cheung Fun, Char Siu Beef Short Ribs, and the Cantonese Fried Rice.

Taste (5\/5): The dumpling skin of the har gow was very delicious and unique compared to other chinese restaurants. The cheung fun was good as it seemed like a combination of cheung fun and fried shrimp dumplings which provided an interesting soft and crunchy taste. The main attraction was the char siu beef short ribs which if I had time to I can speak about all day. They are actually boneless and these literally melt in your mouth when you take the first bite, which is a pleasant change from the usual chewy short ribs at other restaurants

Service (5\/5): The waiter visited a lot to see how the meal was and was entertaining to have around. Bonus points for the additional service on my birthday

Value (4\/5): For a higher end restaurant the prices are reasonable as it is about $10 for dim sum and $20 for entrees. The portion sizes are a little smaller, but there is still enough food to fill you

"I came here 6 days after their grand opening to celebrate my work place achievement and we were very pleased with quality of food we had for lunch.

I was looking for some nice lunch place to take my team, and knew it had to be somewhere to satisfy foodie colleagues, I thought this newly opened place will be perfect.

Inside this restaurant is very gorgeous. I thought this place will be ideal for after work get together. 

Since our server and actually everyone else is new, I would say server was still learning about their restaurant. He knew about the menu but not to the level I asked. I did end up talking to both chefs at the end and food served made sense. A main chef is from Thai and another is originally from Korea. Based on menu availability, that was my guess and we ordered accordingly. All the food we ordered was really tasty and well flavored. 

Fried rice made by Korean chef tasted like real fried rice should taste, curry had authentic curry flavor, poke had good taste and fish was fresh. Curry came with small serving of rice, we ended up with extra curry sauce and was told later by the chef that I should have asked for more rice... 

Portion size was rather small for the price you pay. In fact, everything was a tad pricey. If not for that special occasion, it won't be my regular lunch place. I guess we pay for the ambiance? 

I really liked their food. Although server was slow but it was shortly after grand opening. I would wait just bit more before coming back to try some of their interesting menu options.",1.0

"Holy crap, they can't even stand up under their own name. I inadvertently posted this review under the CenturyLink store, but this is indicative of just how slimy these parasites are.

This is from the fake link you  get if you don't look closely and assume that any company would be proud of their brand and not try to hide behind resellers;

Pity the poor person that has no choice but to toil for these thieves. The only standard in existence that makes CenturyLink a viable choice for any service in Las Vegas is the utter lack of any competition or choice. Here, your choice is to get screwed by CenturyLink or you can be fucked by Cox, end of file.

Every single thing that either of these parasites tells you is a lie. They don't deliver the speed promised and they could not care any less about it once they have the contract.

Old customer or new, pay your bill or not, makes no difference. The people you will be directed to for help with technical issues are idiots who know nothing but how to read a sales script for $10 an hour.

Both my wife and I retired from this industry. We've forgotten more than these morons have ever known about computers and networks, and the depth of utter BS they try to spread over their incompetence and refusal to deliver promised services is inversely indicative of how little they pay their workers.

I'd advise avoiding these thieves, but the only alternative is the cable thieves, who are, if you can even conceive of it, even less capable and technically competent.

"This is the first review I have ever written, but I feel the need, like so many others, to warn customers against using CenturyLink. I do marketing for a living, and have written marketing books, and though they have many good people working for them, a couple of which who have told me they are extremely frustrated with CenturyLink themselves, there policy is clearly that profits overrule anything else, and customer dissatisfaction or dealing with customers in any way fairly, simply isn't a part of their customer philosophy. 

If you want to spend hours on hold being shifted from one person to another, and then be frustrated when the phone disconnects in the middle of your hold after your ninth transfer, then CenturyLink is the place for you. If you want a company that will not stand by what their customer service people told you and tell you that the onus is on you to prove what you were previously told, then CenturyLink is your best choice of a provider. If you want to see your bill nearly doubled because your contract came up and they decided to add an extra more than $100 without any notice or warning, then you are going to love CenturyLink.

CenturyLink spent a fortune wring my complex Anasazi Village and then spent weeks promoting their service. Hundreds of people made the switch and now all I hear are many others here who feel as I do. If there is a worse company in the USA with even lower corporate ethics and lack of concern and contempt for their customers, then I challenge you to name it. I don't know of one or how it could even been possible for any company to have lower scruples than CenturyLink does.

"This is the only place to write a review for Kelly Money Realtor in Phoenix. So I hope it is okay. 

This person (Kelly Money -who apparently likes to stay off of the ""radar"") is the worst realtor I have ever met! I rented a house from her when we relocated and she did nothing but try to constantly sell it to us. I am in the medical profession and just relocated so I did not want to rush into a purchase but she constantly insisted, and when I refused, she tried to actually evict me. Then years later - just recently - I found out she reported me as delinquent on my credit report as an eviction that never happened. I am appalled, as she has seriously hurt my credit rating and LIED! I will be following up with as lawyer, as I have no other choice. You have unjustly ruined my credit rating. And this is why I am writing this review. Seriously Kelly what is wrong with you. I WILL get this corrected! ...like I don't have better things to do. You are a fraud and and a scam artist, and a really mean, aggressive person. 

I will be volunteering soon overseas with my church to help the impoverished with diabetes, foot conditions and other illness. I don't need this right now, but you have given me no other choice!

Unfortunately, the house we actually rented from her was falling apart with all kinds of problems. No wonder she pressured us so aggressively into purchasing it from her.

August 2, 2017-I go in to check out a Nissan Pathfinder. Everything looks great it runs great. Cool. Put an offer in. They ask how much would I like to down. I said $500. They said great we can ""work with you"" on that. Punching numbers in yada yada yada. And they come back with ""can you actually put $1500 down?"" I was skeptical but did like the vehicle. I said sure I guess I can do that, if it means I'll get the truck. They run some more numbers, credit check, whatever. They come back with a ""can you actually put $2350 down?"" I said no I can not do that. But they said they wanted to ""work"" with me so they said I can pay that $2350 within 45 days all while I get to keep the car. Cool. So that's settle. Got insurance. Drove home.

Flash forward to a couple weeks later:
August 31st-they say ""can you bring the car in we just need to take a couple photos."" Thinking nothing of it, head over there and they say ""finance fell through we're actually gonna be keeping the car."" I was like okay? So do I get my down payment back since finance fell through? They said ""no because you lied on your credit application."" WHAT?!?! I've never heard such thing. I spoke to Lulu on numerous occasions and her answer is still firm. Absolutely no refunds whatsoever. I wasn't even offered to look at another car or use that down for a cheaper a car or anything. It was straight up you're not getting your money back. I contacted the proper authority in order to attempt to get my money back and they advise that I mediate with the dealership before going through a full fledged civil lawsuit. Tried mediating and the answer on their end was still firm, YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK. So at this point, I have no choice but to go forward with a lawsuit because they don't want to negotiate with me. And they said I was lucky they didn't charge me for putting miles on the car and what not. So. Here we are.

"EDIT ** AMAZING AIRLINE. READ BOTTOM OF REVIEW FOR TIPS. I missed my flight cuz I was late to the airport and Spirit was VERY accommodating and put me on a different connecting flight for FREE. 
READ ALL THE FINE PRINT ON THE WEBSITE BEFORE YOU BOOK AND MEASURE YOUR BAGS BEFOREHAND. If you do this you can avoid the ridiculous baggage and ticketing fees and actually have a pretty good experience. 
Sure I didn't get any refreshments and I couldn't recline my seat but the aircraft was impeccably clean and out of the four times I've flown with spirit it's always been on time and there's never been cancellation or delays with this airline. You get what you pay for, and if all you need is to get yourself from point A to point B with little to no luggage and you're on a price crunch, this airline will do the job. 
I just personally wouldn't recommend this airline for flights longer than 2 hours since there's no legroom and refreshments. 
10\/10 would take Spirit airlines again for short trips.

Only shitty part is that my makeup bag and laptop takes up more than half the space in the bag that spirits allows to carry on for free so I basically layer and wear like 3 outfits on top of each other to make room for other things in the bag.

Tip #1: Spirit has a VERY strict policy where you have to be at the gate 15 minutes prior to your flight time, otherwise they won't let you in. All the other airlines like Southwest lets you get on even five minutes prior, but once, I arrived at the gate 14 minutes prior to departure and THEY WOULD NOT OPEN THE DOOR AND LET ME ON THE PLANE. I ended up missing my flight but they put me on the next connecting flight for free.

Tip#2: The free carry on baggage size is exactly 14 x12x16. If your bag goes even a centimeter above that, then you'll have to pay a ridiculous free. I found that most gym bags do the job since they stretch and you can fit in ALOT and even though the actual dimensions are more than the allotted, I always made it fit in the carrying measuring basket they have.",1.0
"Summary: Unacceptable service, overpriced booze, weak mixed drinks, and not nearly enough stations for playing games.

Long rant ahoy, fair warning.

I was pretty excited to come here for the first time after hearing some positive feedback from friends that went. Unfortunately it wasn't much of a positive experience at all.

Firstly, the service was very poor. The waitress was pretty prompt on asking for and delivering our first order, but it was all downhill from there. It took a very long time to be asked if I wanted another drink, so I went up to the bar and waited for about 20 minutes. Not even an acknowledgment. To be fair, it was very busy, but at least a ""be with you in a moment"" would have been nice. It also demonstrates a lack of proper staffing to handle the volume of customers.

Eventually, the same waitress came back and I placed another order for a beer. During this time I chatted with friends and played on the NES nearby. After about a half hour, no beer. My girlfriend politely asked if we could cancel the beer order and cash out, then the waitress said she left my beer on a nearby table out of view. She didn't bother to either hand me my beer or at least tell me that she brought it and set it on the table. Dangerous if someone wants to spike your drink. Once she came back with the check, she rudely asked my girlfriend if I was still drinking my beer or if she should throw it away. The beer was in my hand. :P 100% unacceptable attitude towards a customer, especially since we were nothing but polite to her despite our frustration.

Second, the drinks are lame. The beer was under poured to about 2\/3 of the cup. The cups were standard small plastic bar fare, about 8oz if I had to guess. No reason to under pour with cups that small outside of artificially getting more drink orders. 

As for the mixed drinks, my girlfriend got a Springfield, which was Simpson's themed and came with a donut. Nest concept and it tasted fine. However, there was barely any booze in it. She's a total lightweight due to gastric sleeve surgery and gets pretty drunk off of one glass of wine. She was stone cold sober after drinking all of it. Other people we spoke to had similar complaints.

Adding to it, the drinks are overpriced, even for Downtown. Two small draft beers and one weak mixed drink totaled $26.

Third, there weren't enough game stations for people to play. Its nice that you don't have to pay for bottle service to play them like the did at Insert Coins, but that also means people squat on them and play them without time limits. There are four stations for a room that fits about 200 people. 

All in all, a very disappointing and unacceptable experience.

I genuinely want this place to succeed both because I really like the theme and embrace of nerdy things in a bar (cosplayers, video games, music from nerdy games and movies, etc.), and because Neonopolis needs a big shot in the arm, but if these things aren't addressed, it's going to eventually wither and die just like Jillian's and the Drag Bar did before it.",1.0

"I have eaten both lunch and dinner here. The food is okay. Not spectacular but adequate Italian food. 

All their choices are ala carte so no matter what you get you have to pay extra for a salad or pasta to go with chicken or veal. Personally I hate that. Pasta has to cost pennies for most restaurants so to charge me an extra $4 is just plain greedy. So you pay $21 for chicken parm or $25 with added pasta. Then add $6 for a salad. Again, maybe it's just me, but I think that's a ripoff. 

Service is okay. I always feel the servers here are pushing for the highest bill possible. Also if your a dry wine drinker, your at home. They don't have any sweet wines. Too bad for me.

If this place was not right on the water I know there would be no customers there, would shutdown fast.
3.  Such a beautiful setting for a dumpy looking place.  It is so dated, bathrooms are horrible, outdoor deck is dark and dreary.  I have no idea why they would not try to update and make it more of a waterfront looking establishment.....and update their menu.

"I was so surprised to see a 3.5\/5 stars on Yelp for this place, so I feel compelled to do a review. I've dined here several times and I have had nothing but great experiences. The food is always spot on. I guess you could say it's pricey, but I really don't take that into consideration unless the food is bad, and in this case it isn't. $60 per person is a solid average price, I think. More if you want a lot of drinks.

Wine list is really great. Go for the bottle rather than the glass.

The cake is out of this world. Always. Get. The. Cake.

This is one of the best spots in Madison for a dinner or even a small snack after work during the week. As far as Tory Miller restaurants go, this one is probably second or third best after L'etoile and possibly Graze (maybe a tie).",1.0
"If you want top of the line dining experience, come to CUT by Wolfgang Puck (located in the Venetian).

They will put your towel on your lap and explain the menu very thoroughly. After you order they come out with a plate with different types of bread on there. I told our person to pick the top two and oh my good. Bread never tasted so good. I'm not the type to eat carbs but this kind of carb I can eat!

They then come out with 5 different meats to show you and they explain each meat out to you and how it's prepared. Never had this type of experience in my life so it was very interesting.

Marrow Flan: Basically Bone Marrow that is prepared very delicate.
Cavatappi: Mac & Cheese that is very cheesy. Really good!
Corn: Oh my lord jesus, this was amazinggggg. I loved this corn - perfect.
Show me love: This is a drink that went gone quick so I guess this was good.
US Filet + 2 extra oz of US Kobe: Big portion, this will fill you up. My friend said this was really good.
Miyazaki Wagyu: Upon ordering the prices go by every 2 ounces but you have to order a minimum of 6 ounces and that's what I did.

Expect to spend big bucks for this place. The total for two people was $377.80 including tax.

The steaks were prepared well and has a nice char to is. They will set out different sauces for you to pair it with but I honestly don't think you need to use the sauce.

At the end they give you 4 types of dessert to try from. Recommend in Vegas for a great dining experience!",1.0
"Looking for a fun Caribbean spot? Gotta come to Ocean Blue! 

A couple friends and I decided to try this as part of my goal to try more international foods around the Valley. It's low-key\/not terribly fancy in an unassuming small strip mall. My kind of place to find low-key good food! It wasn't terribly busy when we stopped by so pretty much we had the bartender\/server's sole attention. He was really helpful with selecting what to eat and drink. I was feeling festive so I ordered their punch version of a Dark N Stormy. Holy alcohol... that packed a punch!

The menu is mostly chicken and fish with varying Caribbean spices. While they offer some American food, I wouldn't go for that...stick with the purpose of eating there! All of us went with one of the traditional dishes, myself the Jerk Chicken Island Style with veggies (festivals) & plantains. I cannot pass up fried plantains, and these were great. If you order 1\/4 or 1\/2 a chicken, it will be a 1\/4 or 1\/2, not shredded or ""chicken strip"" type. I think I went wrong with getting the plantains and festivals though, as it just didn't seem like enough to eat. I cleaned my plate and left still hungry. Next time I should probably not come ravenous.",1.0
"This was our first dinner during our trip to Vegas. We stayed at the Palazzo and figured we should check out what the hotel's restaurants had to offer. We were celebrating a birthday, so we did decided to go a little more high end.

Large , delicious menu with a seafood theme. 
Nice drink menu & lots of options.
Many people in our party had the Surf & Turf ""Special"" - nice lobster tail stuffed with a filet. Gorgeous presentation.

Service was impeccable.

"From a Chinese noodle lover, this is a regretful visit.

We came here for the fresh made pulled noodle, we were told the wait is over an hour because the machine is broken and the chef is not there. Wait! I thought the pulled noodle is always made by man not machine!! Apparently this is a machine made type of store.

We ordered b3, the knife cut noodle. The noodle is flat ok, the broth is not. Too sweet and too garlicky, and meat is undercooked.

We also order the (boiled) dumpling and beef pocket pancake . This is the part I strongly question the authenticity of the store. Everyone who has eaten the beef pancakes know the best (and  most cautious) part of eating it is the juice inside it. You bite a small opening, let the steam out, and carefully suck the soup\/ juice out of the pocket! Nope! Not this store, they simple cut it in half so the juice and the heat are lost! And the onion inside, is undercooked. Not a big fan of half cooked veggies. And the dumplings, of course is broken. Authentic Chinese dumplings should not be broken, once again, to keep the juice inside.

Lastly, they charge $1 for tea. REAL Chinese restaurant will not charge for tea. Why? Because it is a gesture to show hospitality. It's a cultural thing. I know some of you may say but many restaurants do that, I can only say, my dear friends, then you haven't visited  the REAL AUTHENTIC GOOD ones. No offense, just saying. :)",1.0

"I have been here many times over and my family have always enjoyed the experience here. I would say this has become my parent's default place for family dinners whenever they come to Toronto to visit me and my sister, especially when we can't make up our minds as to where to have dinner. Everything about this restaurant is just awesome - service, atmosphere, portions, food quality, and price. We always leave happy and satisfy. 

They have set dinners or you can order from their regular menu. We normally come here for dinner, we haven't tried their dim sum service yet. But then again, we don't generally dim sum too much. We generally order a set dinner and add other dishes if needed. I really like their Peking Pork Chops (I know the Chinese name better but can't seem to type Chinese ..... so this may not be their English name for the dish...). Their steam fish is really good too. I also like their desert that comes with the dinner service - you get a choice from red bean sweet soup, mung bean sweet soup, and sweet tofu desert. Their desert is always not too sweet (I don't like overly sweet Chinese deserts or overly sweet desert in general). 

The only draw back of the location of this restaurant is their parking lot. Their parking lot is small..... so if you coming in a group, carpool if you can. I would also make reservations if you are a large group for dinner.",1.0

"Happy hour here is one to try out, 2-6pm. $5 glasses of Rose, $8 kombucha cocktails, beer specials. A few $6 appetizer specials; I opted for the avocado hummus and the mushroom pizza. I would order both again; perhaps without the greens topping on the pizza. I would also ask for more veggies to be served with the hummus to keep it a bit healthier. Tip: the pizza crust dipped in the hummus is delicious!! Both portions could serve as a full meal for one on their own.

"I have been eating at Avina's for over 30 years.  Back when the original restaurant was at 43rd Ave and Bell Road.  It was the BEST Vietnamese food in the valley.  When Avina sold it to the new owners they changed a lot of the recipe's and it just is not the same anymore.  They are always busy so I am sure they will stay in business but they are so disorganized and the service is horrible.  We keep going there hoping for the old Avina's and keep getting disappointed.  We were just there this weekend and our egg rolls were so cold we had to send them back.  Then we watched people that came in after us, order, eat and leave before our food came.  When our food finally came, it was cold!  Then they kept looking at the checks stacked up at the register and you could tell they were not sure which check belong to which table.  We had to go up to the register to pay, they never brought the check.  They never refill drinks, they leave the dirty dishes on your table until you leave, they don't ask if your food is good or if you would like anything else and as another review noted they don't ask about dessert which they could increase their sales if they did since they have Boba and Snow which is good.  I am so disappointed in the new owners.   They must not have owned a restaurant before and they need some serious help!  We have been trying other Vietnamese restaurants and have not found a new favorite yet.  If I had a choice for my last supper it would be Vietnamese food so I can't express enough the disappointment I have with the way this restaurant has changed.

"The only reason I give this facility 2 stars is that it is open late and it was fairly clean. Otherwise, I would not recommend this place to any families. We came here late one night because my son broke out in hives; we filled out the application form and waited approximately 1 hour. 15 minutes in the car, 10 minutes in the freezing cold waiting room, and the final 30+ minutes in the patient room. When the doctor came in, she asked us what was wrong but did not really care what we had to say. She did a very fast assessment of our son and claimed he had an ""ear infection"". She didn't even look at the hives on his skin until my wife asked her as she was halfway out the door.  The doctor calls in a Medical Assistant that does a throat swab on my son. About 10 minutes later, the doctor comes back with our prescription for antibiotics and allergy medication. This doctor was not attentive to family or the patient and her only goal was moving on to the next patient to collect their $150 fee.

I wanted something light for a snack so I went with their popcorn chicken. For the price I paid I was expecting something a bit bigger.

"Preposterously thundering in the wee hours of Sunday a.m. with Hip club ditties of now and then, and always at full capacity, Townhall intimidates by sheer virtue of its scope and raucous (if urbane\/crafty-industrial) tone, and yet, make no mistake dear hungover solace-seekers: these brunch aficionados know their craft inside and out, and they serve with skill and zeal. The legion of servers appear taciturn but generous, armed with tablets for quick order-punching, and thus strike the primo juxtaposition of empathetic to those of us still mired in wine-loud fever dreams, and yet dutiful to the Herculean task of holding court against the masses at large (which are, let's be real, intent often enough on swallowing everything in sight). The brunch menu, if not enormous, succeeds in variety. Many items can be fixed up vegan and\/or veg-friendly, a most welcome feature--try the stalwart organic Eggs Benedict with smooth ripe avocado subbed for bacon or the 25th Street Burrito (a serviceable third pounder with smoky cheese and a ghost of chili spice). And, yes, Boozehounds seeking witty signs rejoice: cocktails with flouncy, clunky, if intertextually endearing monickers prevail: the ""Why's the Carpet All Wet, Todd?"" acting as de facto winner of the obscurest reference to everyone's favorite x-mas movie devoid of an electrical appendage contest. Elsewhere, I sing the twee beauty of the lil' juices--one must absolutely indulge in the power green, a minuscule marvel, yet delighting with its savage\/springy ginger heaven flavor: served in a botanist's oblong jar, it's also pretty pleasant on the peepers. In fact, its rather a synecdoche for TH, it might be said: creative in vision, and bodily-cleansing, served with care and dignity in a semi-incongruous atmosphere of rich wood grain, sharp angles, and a relentlessly upbeat soundtrack. The history of brunch is the history of carbs and booze and crowds and coffee: Townhall is a quintessential era-definer, an index of that history in microcosm. Worth a look and then some.",1.0

"If I could write a review with negative stars I would.  Before I write this review, I am 20 year BofA customer in Las Vegas and it has never been this bad.  It has reached a new low.   Obviously, the banking industry is going to automation.  I get it.  This isn't new.  People are expensive because you have to pay them benefits, they call in sick, they need overtime, and they sue you when they don't get it.  Automation is the wave of the future.  However, this is an industry that demands some face to face interaction.  Customers expect that.  We see this in particular with older customers, merchants, people requiring several transactions, or if they require the funds to post to their accounts immediately. 
  I needed to deposit several thousand dollars cash on a Monday.  Bad situation.  I want that money to post to my account right away.  I know what I want to do at the ATM and what I don't.  I use the smart phone feature to deposit checks remotely.  Can't do that with cash.  If the ATM sucks up the cash it will do it with an envelope and it will be processed later.  Frankly, its my money and I'm just not doing it that way.  This is my right.  
I go into the bank on Eastern next to Del Taco this morning and wouldn't you know it?  Two windows open out of six.  There are 15 customers in line.  I take my place in line and there is one person at a merchant window taking up as much time as he possibly can with God knows what - all I could see is that he was being given stacks of empty cash envelopes - is he planning on doing stocking stuffers for 100 grandchildren in June? The line isn't moving.  Frustration is slowly simmering.  An older foreign man starts raising a fuss with the bank employee which eventually rises to the level of the manager getting involved (not behind the window mind you just milling around trying to force people out of the line to go to the ATM is their apparent job).  Even the manager can't calm him.  She has no discernable duty other than to smile and to divert them from the line.   The older agitated foreign man is not having it and raises hell.  There is no convincing someone to use an ATM - The personal banker trying to quiz him about what his reason is for coming in ? and isn't there something you can tell me about your transaction that I might direct you over here at the ATM ?  She doesn't get.  Finally she gets to me to try the same trick.  Knowing she was about to get to me, I have my back turned.  Now I'm surrounded by at least 20 or 25 people and the line is snaking to the door.  The whole lobby is filled with customers waiting for the two open windows.  Kids crying and flopping on the floor, Workers with zippered envelopes waiting for the merchant teller, people clutching various checks to cash and someone want to talk to me. . .  I'm supposed to describe why I am there to her so she can attempt to pull me out of the line and send me somewhere else.  I know what I want.  No way.  I am committed!   I am also NOT broadcasting that I have a couple thousand dollars in cash on me right now. I ignore her and maybe she will leave me alone and assume I can't understand English.  She keeps repeating, ""Sir, what brings you here today?""  Finally, I can't take it anymore and I tell her, ""I am not discussing my business out in the open.""   She takes the hint and goes through a door and retreats to safety behind the bullet proof glass to see what is happening with the one teller.  Now three workers are barricading themselves behind glass at the one open window watching the same computer monitor to process one customer request.  

Finally the super agitated man gets his chance.  Surely, here is man who knows what he wants and values time.  He goes to the window and starts his transaction. At some point the teller mentions ""sir, if you want to deposit you need to fill out a deposit ticket.""  That's when I finally lost it.  By now everyone in line waiting are friends, battle brings people together in close comradery.  I let him have it, "" Oh sure, the guy who is running his damn mouth the loudest, doesn't even have his deposit slip filled out when he gets to the window. . . this the same asshole who goes to the post office to mail a package and expects the post office to tape it closed for him.""   All of the people in line agree shaking their heads.  The Smiling bank manager locks eyes with me and nods her head in complete and absolute approval of my commentary as if to say, ""See, you understand the hell I live in - this is the shit I have to deal with on a daily basis.""  

I get my chance, hit the window, slap the money and a pre-printed and fully filled out deposit ticket in the slot and swipe my debit card with my opposite hand.  Immediately shifting to typing my pin.  Before my teller can even finish asking how my day is going - I tell her to fix her operations.        I beat the agitated man out of there and one other ahead of him. -   If I have to come back here again it will be too soon.",1.0

"I always enjoy my time at Daylight.  It is especially fun when they have night concerts with artists like Ice Cube and Dub Cee. That's the last concert that I went to at Daylight.  The crowd wasn't too bad. They were all pretty much minding their own business and were just dancing with one another.  There aren't too many bars.  So, unless you score a nice seating area and a bottle, you might have some trouble getting the drinks you want when you want them.  Prices are fair, at the bar.  I think it was about $15 per drink, roughly.  I was with my girls and we were invited up into a private cabana with a private pool.  It was fun but the better view and best vibe were on the base floor with all the other fans.  Thanks to Alan F. for the last minute hook up!  I always enjoy coming here. You should check it out!! One thing to remember, if you are going to Daylight. . . make sure that your cab or Uber driver drops you off on the convention center side and not the main Mandalay Bay entrance. Otherwise, there'll be a hike involved. One thing to know, too, is that you can always find shade in the area where the bar is.

"This is the cutest, most cozy family-owned restaurant that I've ever been to and I absolutely love everything about it.

The menu is very minimal, but it's a positive detail to note because they are very specialized in wonton soups, so you know that they are going to taste great. This restaurant is cash only, so make sure you have some before you walk in.

I ordered the wonton and beef with the soup on the side, while my friend ordered the signature noodle with the soup in the dish.

The wontons are really big and they give an abundant amount for the small price. At only $5-7 dollars per dish, I can understand why this establishment is highly popular. Very fast service, very friendly owners as well.

"I am such an ice cream fan - anytime and all the time! I was in Mississauga for the day and decided to look around for a cool ice cream place and Dairy Cream came up close to me so I decided to check it out.

Dairy Cream is a little spot (similar to Dairy Queen set up to be honest) and it was lined up way out the door. It was a crazy hot day, and like me I am sure everyone loves ice cream on a hot day so I was willing to wait. The line did move relatively quickly and it seemed like the staff were pretty efficient. 

This place is legit cash only, so bring your dollar bills or hit up the ATM at the side of their building. Definite brownie points for having that ATM on site because I never, ever carry cash. So I waited in line for maybe 10 minutes or less, and I couldn't really see then menu from outside so I wasn't sure what I was going to get. I saw people coming out with dipped cones, regular hard ice cream flavours, swirl cones, slushies, and funnel cakes. When I got up to the front I made a quick decision because there were about 100 people behind me so I grabbed a vanilla soft serve cone dipped in butterscotch. BUTTERSCOTCH!

It was crazy hot but surprisingly my ice cream didn't melt too fast with my dip around it. I decided to sit in my bar with the door open because I left the multiple tables for the families (yes I am so nice eh!?) It's nice that there is some tables and also a few under a tree. My ice cream was huge and it was so tasty and filling. Next time I'll come more hungry and try a funnel cake.

There is quite a few parking spots - although when people line up it's basically a line straight down into the parking lot so I could see that being a bit dangerous with cars pulling in off of a busy street. Not sure how to combat that when you have 100 people waiting for ice cream but yeah!

The lady and I started with toasted avocado bread, which is what it sounds like: toasted bread topped with avocada. It was actually pretty good, and is a good hangover cure if you're not feeling too hot.

For our lunches we each ordered salads. It was called the chicken avocada salad or something similar, and it was a LARGE salad. One of the biggest i have eaten in my life, actually. It was covered in guac, chicken, black beans, tortilla strips, corn... just a lot of stuff packed in, and I could barely even finish it. I also had a frozen strawberry margarita. Recommended.

"Went there for the 3rd time this past weekend.  The first thing both my guest and I noticed about the place is that it looked and smelled fresh and SPOTLESS.  When we used the bathroom facilities they were SPOTLESS as well.  Since the last time I was there, they have removed a lot of the silk flowers and silk plants that I deplore in eating establishments.  The wait staff (men and women) were so friendly and attentive and it did not seem ""forced.""  The food was hot and fresh and tasty.  The carrot cake was DEVINE - 4 layers with cream cheese icing in between each layer.  There was a steady stream of customers - all ages, all kinds!  On the way out, we were personally greeted by the new owner:  a kind and elegant gentlemen.  He took the time to introduce himself and have a chat with us.  What can I say?  I will definitely be back.  This place DESERVES business.  Keep up the good work Symposium in Thornhill.  Thank you very much for all your efforts and keep it up!

I have tried a handful of things now and so far, I have enjoyed every single item. The menu is creative and innovative, and I can't wait to continue to try more of what they have to offer. 

The only reason I am docking one star is because of a minor blip-- I placed an order online for pickup (I used to live very close to the restaurant). I got confirmation my payment went through and the order was received, and given an estimate as to when it would be ready. Great, perfect. 

When I arrived, though, they hadn't received the order :( They apologized profusely and got to work right away on making up our order which was good, but it was still just a little annoying having to sit there and wait when we should have already been back home gobbling up some delicious yummies.

Modern and spacious facilities. But the service is really bad. Purchased tickets online but they refused to issue me tickets because I didn't have my Scene card or credit card with me. I showed them booking number but they said screenshot doesn't count and tell me to find the original emails. Then they asked me to show an ID reflecting name on my booking email. I don't know what's the point of booking ref if I need to bring ID. Finally they agreed to give me tickets I purchased but told me remember to bring credit card with me next time.

"This service is a complete waste of time and money. At first I was lured by the convenience of the concept. However my last box was missing an ingredient, which resulted in me running to grocery store for it. I called customer service and was told he would notate what happened to avoud it recurring. I said that didnt really make up for the inconvenience. After prompting the rep that he needed to do more I was offered 1 free meal credit. I was unimpressed with the way the rep originally tried to dismiss the situation but I decided to give the service one last chance.

My next delivery was never delivered. I called customer service at 6pm PST and was asked to call back 7pm PST if I had not recieved it.

I called back to let them know there was still no delivery. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!! The rep Ashton proceed to cut me off multiple times when I explained that I would like to refunded the delivery I did not recieve as scheduled. He told me he would have to figure out what happened with Fedex first as they said they were unable to deliver. I explained that I was home all day so there was no way I could have missed them. I also explained that no matter what Fedex said, it would not change the fact that I did not recieve the package. I asked for a manager and he said there was no one else working and that everyone had left...( online hours stated that call centre was open for another hour)

He said I would have to wait for a call back tomorrow. I asked for the number I would be called back on I would know to pick it up. I explained that I don't usuallu answer unrecognised or 1-800 numbers. He said he did not know... He said I would be called from the managers cells phone ( which he could not give me) or a customer service number.

I called back again asked why he was only one working when they were open for another hour when I called.He had  no real answer for that other that he was only bilingual agent ( I was speaking english so I'm not sure how him being bilingual was even relevant)

I asked what time his manager would call be calling  me back... he was unable to answer that too.

Now I have to wait around all day tomorrow for a phone call (I hope to god I don't miss it and have to call back and deal with incompetent reps) and figure out where to grab a last minute dinner from tonight as I was counting on the delivery.

"Things to remember if you plan on doing business with RPMLV (from the standpoint of a property owner):

Be prepared to wait days for a response to your concerns.  It regularly took three or four voicemails and emails to speak to an actual person.  Customer service ends the second they have your signature on the contract.

Fees, fees, fees!  If you are a property owner, be prepared to have hidden charges appear on your statements on a monthly basis.  They will find ANY way they can to siphon money out of your account and keep it for themselves for doing nothing.  And good luck getting anyone on the phone to explain why they are keeping YOUR money.

Get EVERYTHING in writing.  I have been lied to on more than one occasion by multiple people at this office.  When I would remind them of what was said in a phone conversation they would conveniently ""not remember saying that.""  When you can actually talk to one of these people make sure to send a follow up email detailing your conversation or they will deny things said in a phone conversation (and find something to charge you for on top of it!).

Do NOT believe that they are checking on your property in any meaningful way.  They will charge you for ""property inspections"" to do nothing more than deliver air filters for the AC.  Once I was finally done with these people I found my property with the WRONG sized air filters installed and half a dozen unused filters in the closet.  The probably just leave them at the door and do not even check on the property.  The horrid condition in which my property was left tells me that either no one was looking at the property during these ""property checks"" or they simply didn't care (as long as they could charge me).

Do NOT trust their vendors to work on your property.  I don't know what kind of unlicensed handymen they use to do repairs, but they are definitely NOT experienced professionals.  One of the many repairs needed to my property after the lack of professional attention by RPMLV was the air conditioner.  I used a local professional AC repair company, and when the technician came down from the roof the first words out of his mouth were, ""There's no easy way to say this, but the last person who worked on this unit was an idiot.""  The unit was NOT grounded and wires had been connected incorrectly causing the compressor to blow at a cost of $2,500.  The ONLY repairs to the AC in the past four plus years had been done by RPMLV vendors.

Do NOT get them involved in the sale of your property.  Once they found out I was selling my property, they tried to tempt me with ""cash"" buyers and ""smooth"" deals.  All I received were extremely low ball offers with a laundry list of why my property wouldn't sell for more.  They are interested in getting the best deal for their buyers without any recognition for the years you've spent as a client (and the thousands of dollars they've already managed to charge you).  After realizing that they were not looking out for my best interests, I found my own realtor and ended up with a cash offer of nearly $40,000 more than RPMLV realtors could get.

"Stripchezze Food Truck is one of my favorite food trucks here in Vegas. Not only is Suzy and her crew always friendly and helpful, but it's very obvious how genuinely passionate they are about the type of product that are putting out. Quality ingredients are used and everything I have had has been packed full of amazing flavor. Don't expect to find any old school grilled cheese made with Kraft singles here at Stripchezze Food Truck, not that I have anything against those because they are tasty with tomato soup, no shame. These grilled cheese sandwiches however are on a totally different level and my taste buds are in love with them.

Daddy's on a Roll ($7) - Deep fried 3-cheese mac and cheese egg rolls with kimchi dipping sauce. These were delicious and not too greasy at all. My hubby liked the kimchi sauce with his while I found the mac and cheese egg rolls tasty all by themselves. Perfectly crispy. Very good and a must try. 

Jackpot Pastrami ($9.50) - Pastrami and Swiss cheese with spicy brown mustard and sweet pickle relish on Parmesan crusted sourdough bread. The bread is grilled perfectly and the Parmesan crust is very good. All the fillings paired nicely together and the pastrami had good flavor. 

Hot Streak ($8) - Pepper Jack cheese and jalapenos served on Permesan and flamin' hot cheetoh crusted sourdough bread with sriracha mayo. Yep, you read all that right! I figured this would be super hot and hard to eat, but not at all. The outer sandwich has just the right crunch and while there is some heat, it tastes great and the flavor is something I haven't had before. Give it a try once and you'll more than likely be hooked. 

Jam on it ($8) - Maple bourbon bacon jam, sliced tomatoes and muenster cheese on Parmesan cheese crusted sourdough bread. This one is by far my favorite! Packed full of amazing flavor, your taste buds will dance and you will constantly crave it, at least I do! That bourbon bacon jam is the effing delicious!

"Came here for a group dinner but was disappointed with not only the food but also the service. Immediately upon arrival the host was snippy because we hadn't made a reservation for 10 people. While I understand that having notice is important and sometimes crucial on a busy night, the restaurant was not busy at all and could have accommodated a table of 10. In addition, our server kept rushing us to order drinks\/food and was not pleasant at all. At the end of our meal, I had asked for a to go container but they didn't bring it to the table at all. 

The food was subpar. With the amount of selection for Thai food in Toronto there are definitely better choices. The food is overpriced in comparison to other places that offer cheaper prices with better flavor. I ordered the red Curry with chicken and the chicken while good was pretty plain. The curry was soupy and I was hoping there would be strong flavour to make up for the somewhat bland chicken. The spice level was also inconsistent across all the dishes ordered even though they were all ""level 3"" some were not spicy while others were over spiced. 

The crispy beef red curry was also okay. The beef was dry. I liked the curry spice level 1 better for this dish and thought it was good but nothing special. 

Overall, it's a good place to come if you want to eat in a fancy environment but if you're coming for true Thai food, you might be disappointed. However, as I mentioned before, there are other Thai restaurants in Toronto that I would gladly visit (with better service) before coming back here.",1.0

Very good, but a little too hot for me so I'll go with the red chilies next time. My husband ordered a cheese stake and it was amazing.

We thought it was pretty great.  The location makes it ideal for walking around Old Montreal, and honestly all of Montreal if you're willing (we walked over 40 miles in our time).  The rooms are really large, and give you that old\/historic feel.  

The hotel staff was really friendly, and happy to assist in any way possible.  

We did hear someone complaining when we were there and how he wasn't going to be leaving a positive assessment.  He was somehow having issues using the key to his door.  As someone who also was unable to open the door for a days, I feel his pain.  However, each time I couldn't open the door with my slow swipe, my girlfriend would then take the key from my hand, and open it with no issue.  So. . . it's user error, and not likely that the key would just stop working over and over again. 

It can be loud on the weekends with people out on the streets below.  This isn't really an issue with the hotel, but rather the location.  Out simple fix was to turn on some white noise from our phone, and that solved that.  

Overall, it was a great stay, and we really enjoyed it.  If we ever end up in Montreal again, we'll be staying here.",1.0
"Walked in and was greeted by two people at the desk but beyond that they were useless.  

I asked questions about what they had for seniors; she told me the names of the 2 programs they had there. When I followed up with questions about the programs and prices, she said I need to look it up online.  

They obviously don't need new members.",1.0

"Amazing buffet! Went on a Sunday late afternoon around 1:45. Chai tea and mango beverages included along with garlic naan. Chicken tikka and the potato masala were both excellent!

Very friendly staff and ice cold water served (which means a lot to me, can't stand room temp water) Will go back.",1.0
"Maintenance men (TWO of them!) came into my apartment without knocking and without any advance notice, not even a phone call.  I was undressed and using the bathroom when they busted in.  They claimed that in an ""emergency"" they don't have to give advance notice.  But shouldn't you at least knock before using your pass key to bust in???  Now I'm afraid because they won't promise not to do it again if another ""emergency"" comes up.  Frequent water shut offs with no notice OR they promise to have it back on in 2 hours but it actually takes 6-8.  Teens smoking pot in the kiddie play area.  Rampant theft...I have to have packages shipped to a friend's apartment because anything that's delivered here gets stolen.  ""Security"" gates are frequently broken and are standing open.  Walkway gates are ALWAYS open.  Come on in and steal stuff, anyone!!!  Utility charges go up by up to $50 per month.  My rent is supposed to be $800 but this month it's $872!!  Then when they asked me to renew (4 months early), they jacked the base rent up by $79.  Nope, not paying MORE to stay in this ghetto.  Moving out next month and I cannot wait.",1.0
"Sweet Jesus! Sweet Pok√© has so many toppings- mango, masago, avocado, and more! With pok√© bowls so delicious, I could eat here every damn day. Here, you move left to right as you choose a base, protein(s) from 9 choices, sauce (a dozen choices), then toppings. Their seafood and ingredients look and taste super fresh, but their soft shell crab was a little cold and not as crunchy as I had hoped. A regular pok√© bowl has 2 scoops of protein ($9.50) while a large has 3 ($11.99). Service was awesome and all smiles- I was getting sauce for my toddler's pok√© bowl and didn't want it spicy so they let me taste a couple of their non-spicy sauces.

For drinks, they offer bottled water, tea, soda, and juices. Under their ""Sides"" menu, their bag of super thin and crunchy Taro Chips with a creamy sauce that had just a hint of wasabi for $2 was just killer. GET THIS! They also offer a $12.50 meal deal which includes any regular bowl or sushi burrito, a soda, and either edamame, miso soup, taro, chips, or seaweed salad. In addition, they have legit kid's meals including apple juice for $6.99. Since their website kinda sucks right now, here are their choices for pok√© bowls and sushi burritos (seaweed or soy paper):

BASES: white rice, chips, brown rice, salad, organic tofu, half-half

PROTEINS: Ahi tuna, yellowtail, salmon, cooked salmon, soft shell crab, scallop, shrimp, unagi (freshwater eel), tako (octopus)

"Dr. Roach and the entire staff are courteous and attentive from the moment you walk into‚Äã the calm waiting area (they re-clean the floor throughout the day!) and their clean exam rooms. They listen to you when you tell them why you came in. They explain things in a way that's easy to understand and don't talk down to you and are always ready to answer any questions you may have. They want to make sure your experience there is as positive as possible and, to put a cherry on all that, they have reasonable prices! Since they take walk-ins and emergency cases you could have a wait if you don't make an appointment but when you're seen, you'll still get great service from this no-nonsense vet office!

The pulled pork was my favorite: it wasn't fatty or greasy-- it was tender and well seasoned. Green beans had a unique flavor and the cornbread was just right. The experience was made better by how nice the BBQ staff was and the feeling of being at a backyard BBQ.

"I unfortunately do not recommend this attorney's office. I hired them last summer for an HOA matter and while the rates were very reasonable, I am afraid that was because they do not have enough time for their workload. I initially checked in rarely but did not get any response by email. I checked in more frequently but still did not get any email answered or messages returned.  There have been tens of emails with no response or acknowledgement back over the past two years.  I had to start really calling frequently to get the attorney on the line.  This worked better, and he has always very friendly and accommodating by phone but then few if any of the timeframes he set for motions or responses to me after the phone call were met on time.  He would always say he would get something to me and then nothing for honestly months until I called again.  I finally was able to get some cycles one year ago because of court deadlines, an active garnishment, and looking to switch to another attorney, but it was pulling teeth and as soon as the urgency and that phase was done I have since been waiting for 1 FULL YEAR to file in court for recovery of extra money taken and violations of the debt act as Roger said he would do last January.  I am also concerned because most recently Roger said he did file, but the case does not show up and he never allowed me to review it and will not send a copy so I fear he misled me.  I am not the only one, as the attorney was suspended by the Arizona State Bar in 2015 for a month during the time my case was starting. I have just commenced a complaint as well because even though I do not wish more difficulty on the attorney, I really cannot get a response.

"Extremely uneducated jewelers...go ANYWHERE else. In fact, run, don't walk. Went in for a simple gold\/scrap metal buy, had to wait 30 mins to see the one person(out of three apparently) who was trained in testing the metals etc. Once he finally was available, he immediately showed his annoyance\/distaste about most of my metals being silver. He then proceeded to look at them extremely quickly, and judged by 90% feel and inability to find a metal stamp that most of my metal was not real. I had to argue politely and put my foot down several times, as I HAVE PREVIOUSLY WORKED FOR A REPUTABLE JEWELER, and knew for a fact that the majority WAS in fact real sterling\/gold as it was purchased through jewelry distribution companies (stuller, quality gold, etc) directly through the jeweler I worked for. As in, I made the purchase orders so I have no doubts whatsoever it is authentic. He also didn't have the slightest clue what pandora was, and that it is 925 silver. (Even if your clientele is of the older variety and you don't carry a brand, you must be living under a rock in the jewelry industry to not know what pandora is). I left with a check with my name misspelled and half my ""fake"" scrap jewelry, which I then took to another jeweler who actually took the time to properly test it and give it the A-ok. DIAMOND JIM's concept of customer service is truly appalling, and this establishment should literally be cleaned, sanitized, have its cases restocked and displays redone, and have its entire group of representatives let go, and hire new retrained professionals. Preferably a few who actually took a gemology course or two. The owner was not there, perhaps they behave better when he's around, but as a young knowledgeable woman who was not in their clientele demographic, the service was shudder-inducing.",1.0

"My stay at The Madison Concourse Hotel was everything I hoped for and more. Honestly, I rarely opt to make any upgrades when I stay at a hotel, but my stay at The Madison Concourse was the rare exception. My boyfriend and I upgraded to stay on the Governor's floor of the hotel. A stay on the Governor's floor allows you the opportunity to have a great view, unlimited premium alcoholic beverages, appetizers, and hot breakfast the next morning. My boyfriend and I checked in around 5pm, and headed straight to the Governor's lounge after we changed. I wish I remembered our bartenders name, but he was amazing! He was able to create outstanding cocktails based on what flavors I told him I liked. Our room was both clean and quiet. The mattress in our room was extremely comfortable, and I had trouble getting out of it in the morning. My only regret about my stay, is that I didn't leave enough time to check out other parts of the hotel. If you know you will only be using your hotel room for sleeping, then upgrading to the Governor's floor may not be worth it. If you like the idea of spending some or all of your night inside of the hotel, then upgrading is 100% worth it.  Overall, I highly recommend this hotel if you are going to be in the area and seek a great hotel experience.",1.0

"My boyfriend and I decided on a gender reveal in July. Unfortunately, since we're still brand new to the Vegas we wouldn't be able to get a scheduled Ultrasound visit through our OB\/GYN in time for our party. 
That's when we decided to check out Miracles in Progress. They have an awesome Yelp deal so definitely put it to use. 
Upon arriving the lady at the front desk greeted me and had me fill at a form. My package came with a CD of what was seen on my ultrasound along with a choice of music to choose from. The waiting room was beautifully set up. I maybe waited around for 5 minutes or so before they called me back into the ultrasound room. Now these rooms aren't like your typical doctors offices. It was a very LARGE room with sofas, dimmed lights, and a 60"" (or more) screen TV which we would be viewing our ultrasound on. And the bed I laid on was very comfortable. My ultrasound tech was very nice and every once in awhile would lightly push on my tummy to get baby awake and moving. You should've seen! Baby was hopping and jumping around like crazy! It was very entertaining! Once it was time to check out the gender she would turn off the TV to keep it a surprise, printed out the ultrasound picture with the gender and placed it in an envelope. She then turned the TV back on and continued on with out appointment. I would say we were in the room for a good 15-20 minutes. Not too sure what the other reviews meant by being felt ""rushed""? 
We returned back in the waiting room and a few minutes later my CD and pictures were ready for me to take home. I absolutely loved how they came out! The silhouette of my baby was very pronounced and I could even see my baby's little nose and ears. Again, I'm kinda confused with the other reviews saying that they had horrible quality photos. I mean, your baby is still developing. The pictures aren't gonna turn out looking like Mona Lisa. These photos are strictly for ENTERTAINMENT purposes.

"I was so impressed by the Dent Guys that I just had to create a Yelp account to praise them. I just wish that I wrote a review much sooner. Anyways, my car suffered heavy hail damage from a severe hail storm last summer. After doing some research, I found The Dent Guys and was impressed with all of their positive reviews. 

I gave Steve a call and brought in my Charger. I took a quick peek inside the garage to see how they operated and was very pleased to see high end cars being worked on and a classic muscle car in there as well. That right there was very reassuring to me to know that others trusted Steve and his quality of work because anyone who knows me knows that my Charger is my baby and I wouldn't trust her with just anyone. 

Steve gave me the estimate and I agreed to have the work done. Thankfully, my car didn't need to go to a body shop and they would be able to work on it there. The work would take a few days due to the sheer number of the dings and dents on the hood, roof, top of the fenders, quarter panels, and trunk caused by the hail storm. The only hitch was that I'd be leaving the country shortly and I needed to have the work completed prior to when I depart because I wouldn't have anyone to pick up my car. Despite the tight schedule, Steve was able to work with me to ensure that the work would be completed before I left. I really appreciated that. 

When the work was completed, I went to pick up my car and was extremely pleased with the results as my car was in really rough shape before I brought it to the Dent Guys. All of the dings that I remember seeing were completely gone, however I did notice that there was a minor ding on the hood and on the roof that they missed. Not a big deal to me that they missed it considering the high number of dings that I had. They offered to fix it immediately, but due to time constraints, I wouldn't be available to do so. 

Flash forward a year, and I returned to the Dent Guys to finally have those last dings fixed. Despite my situation, Steve didn't even question the request and took out the last two dings in an hour with no charge or hassle whatsoever despite the length of time that passed. 
There's a reason why I chose the Dent Guys to fix my car, and not only did they meet my expectations, but they surpassed it beyond what I could've imagined. Super friendly and super fast quality work that's done with integrity. I couldn't be happier or have asked for more.

"Kaiju is an excellent japanese katsu (Cutlet) \/ curry place tucked away in an underground food court where half the spots are vacant due to lack of foot traffic.  The first time i tried to visit this place, i had a hell of time trying to find this place. Soon i realized that that was common occurrence among first time visitors.  When you find it yourself, you will know exactly what i mean.  

So far, i've been to Kaiju just about 6-7 times and one thing for sure is that their execution is extremely consistent.  Their deep fried foods are so NOT greasy it's quite amazing and upon finishing the meal, you never get that uneasy, unsettling feeling after eating a KFC meal.  They have variety of options such as Fish, Pork, chicken, shrimp, and paired with their signature japanese curry, it's quite the deadly combo (in a good way).

The atmosphere is just as awesome as the food: all ""school"" themed, from menus that look like notebook paper to drink\/food names (the high school dropout Caesar), and my personal favorite element - they bump strictly hip-hop\/rap. In my opinion, the best brunch item is their chicken and waffles. The breading is unlike any I've ever had (even down south) and the hot honey they serve with it is to die for!

I never bothered trying because Vegas had a bunch of place that had snow fluff. However, I think this has became my favorite place. It's similar to the snow fluff i get in Hawaii. It's light and fluffy and not too creamy! The price is super cheap compared to other places and their portion size is huge. My friend and I got a medium to share. It filled us up very well. And the best part, condensed milk is not an extra charge. They actually leave the bottle out! My friend and I took one for our table LOL. The best flavor here is Thai Tea! I usually pick Green Tea anywhere but, the Thai Tea here was just perfect. Another thing, try their mochi! It's different. The lady did say that their mochi is bomb! She wasn't lying. 
Must try!",1.0
"UPDATE

Full disclosure, I got a $30 gift cert from Kinton management for my troubles in the original review (posted below). Went back again and ordered the Miso ramen this time (got the shio, or original, the first time around). Soup was warmer but still not as hot as I would've liked. The charring on the meat was much better this time around; was pretty much non existent the first time. Most importantly we waited maybe 20-25 minutes for our noodles instead of the original 50. Still less than ideal but mildly acceptable, and if we had ordered apps probably would not have seemed extreme. There still does seem to be a bottleneck on the kitchen as you see bowls of noodles going out in batches rather than a constant flow, though apps seem to come out fairly consistently. The restaurant wasn't full so I'm hesitant to give this a 4 stars without seeing if these kind of times remain when they kitchen is fully stressed, but I could see it moving up there if so, and if they manage to deliver noodles to the tables that are actually hot rather than warm-luke warm. 

P.S. Music was also less loud than the first time, so that's a good improvement too. I also thought I'd mention that the design of the restaurant is nice, especially the coat hangers, but all of that generally is secondary to the overall dining experience to me. I still feel this location could be a 2 star or 4 star on any given night depending on how well the kitchen is operating.

Original 2 star review, late February timeframe

Got a table on a Saturday night without a problem. The people who came in afterwards can't say the same but that's just luck. Compared to other kintons, forget other ramen places, this location falls far short. The wait staff was fine but the kitchen seems very poorly managed. The noodles took about 40 minutes after ordering to come and they were subpar. Broth lacked flavour and was a bit cold. Meat was not finished well like you might expect at other kintons (I've been to Yonge and Beverly locations). Music was way too loud. It seems to have seating capacity twice the kintons I've been to but the same size kitchen staff so you have to wait for a table anyways. Would not recommend unless you really want Japanese ramen, plenty of better restaurants in the plaza.",1.0
"After reading about the $.25 Wednesday sales, I was planning my whole day for it. I called to make sure, but the lady said they didn't do that and I asked about other sales throughout the week (not sure if she heard me right) because she kept saying no, no no. It just discouraged me from asking further questions or going all the way to Glendale for the lack of enthusiasm in their service.",1.0
"Great restaurant! Basic decor but there is some cool artwork and items from Ethiopia. This was my first real experience eating Ethiopian and I liked it. Seems like getting one of the feast platters is the way to go, and share with a friend. The staff is friendly and I also learned a lot about Ethiopian culture. Great experience overall.",1.0

Missed due to a New Year closure in early 2016, and thus scheduled as a between-meal stop exactly 365-days later, Welcome Chicken + Donuts confirmed rumors of fried-bird greatness prior to the 2016 Fiesta Bowl while the glazed rounds of Dough were a more mixed experience.

Owned by the same folks behind Phoenix's Welcome Diner, their Southern-style Chicken Sandwich frequently cited as one of The Valley's ""must have"" bites, Welcome Chicken + Donuts sees the team take on a double-fried style akin to Korean Chicken at an East Buckeye Road storefront close enough to the city to be accessible, though those unfamiliar with area may see the building surrounded by barren dirt somewhat out of the way.

Bringing a farm-to-table artisan's touch to comfort food, purveyors such as Red Bird Farms and McClendon's both justifying prices higher than KFC or Dunkin', those entering WC+D after 10:30 Tuesday through Sunday are greeted by the faint smell of oil as well as sweet and savory cooking spices, the Donut case hopefully still stocked from the store's 8am opening.

Undoubtedly another former eatery, the counter-style ordering seeing Donuts boxed or placed in baskets prior to a brief wait at one of several booths, diners are given a choice of several dark or light Meat combos plus Ramen, Sides and daily specials, the choice of just one Thigh and a Drumstick with Sauce on the side showing evidence of a long brine and good spice mix beneath golden Batter while the Thai Yum Slaw brightened shredded Cabbage with Carrots and fragrant Peanut Sauce.

With both fellow-diners completely in love with the fried Bird, requests for more quelled by the reminder of two full-meals to come, Welcome's raised Donuts unfortunately failed to achieve the same high marks thanks to a dense, wheaty base that unfortunately comes across doughy unless filled with Fruit Compote while Cake choices trend only slightly better, the Hot Buttered Rum almost textured like a Buttermilk Bar with restrained sweetness to smooth Frosting overlying the ring below it.",1.0
Great food and service.  Prices aren't the cheapest but it is worth the extra buck for the delicious burgers.,1.0
"Oki have always loved this place, as it has the best breakfast in Charlotte, but today they went above and beyond, through a reason I won't go into I accidentally set fire to the bar (it involved a napkin and a candle) anyway like the idiot I am I grabbed said flaming napkin and immediately set fire to my hand, the barmaid, who I will say has to be the best ever calmly  puts out the fire hands me some burn cream likes it's not a thing, I dare you to find that kind of service anywhere else.",1.0
"Wings are tasty, but range from small to average sized, but single serve portions are small (7-8 pieces).  Comes with fries, 2 celery sticks and two carrot sticks.  Fries are tasty, but I came for the wings.

Tuesday half price deal is only for single serve wings. One drink, one half priced single served wings.  I know that's how the deal is worded, but the last time I ordered, they let two people share a three pound order. To strictly enforce the deal and say the terms of the deal right when you sit down took my excitement away. Only one sauce? Only one pound? I guess if you order a pitcher, they may give you two pounds. I wanted two pounds but only one drink this night.  I think it's smarter to just let one person order two pounds right off the bat, then maybe I'd be more likely to stick around and order more drinks. Note that service here is sloooowwwww, so you will most likely be on your second drink before the one pound comes out. That's another reason they should just let you order two pounds right off the bat.

Anyway, I left disappointed with only one pound and one flavour eaten. Also, the server came back twice not knowing the order.  However, she did explain that she was new. She gave us dill sauce instead of blue cheese. She mixed up our orders so my companion ate one of my wings! Ughhh lol because there's only one pound per person, I got possessive over my pound. 

The layout of the place isn't attractive, tall daunting ceilings, minimal character, the vibe is very detached. It feels like a warehouse rather than a restaurant or bar.  If you sit by the doors during the winter on either side or the middle, you will be very uncomfortable with wild gusts of wind blowing every time someone comes in.

Anyway, if you if come here for the Tuesday wing deal, be prepared to drink, otherwise, have one pound and leave your appetite at home.",1.0

The table decorations are so pretty with live, fresh flowers. The lobby is always clean and well stocked. It is always such a great experience here.",1.0
Thank you!  You rock!  These guys got my car fixed faster than they estimated and at a lower price. Convenience and customer service. Great combination!,1.0
"Momofuku is definitely an Asian restaurant, I'm not sure why Yelp categorizes it as American...? Most of the food here was great and flavorful, but the prices are too steep for what you get. I guess everything in Vegas is just super inflated....

We ordered a pork bun for each person at our table and it wasn't worth the $7 price that we paid. It was good but underwhelming for what you get. I've had better Pork Belly baos. 

We also ordered 2 Pork Ramens for the table to share. It came covered in green onions and mixed greens which was overwhelming for me. The Pork Ramen here was just a very interesting combination of flavors for me and the broth was too salty for my taste. Overall, very confusing bowl of ramen in terms of ingredients included.

For the fancier folk. the Truffle Ramen is available and it's worth a try, but paying $50 for a bowl of ramen is VERY steep and I doubt I would order it again. So for all you truffle lovers, this one is definitely for you.  

If you're dining with a larger party, I recommend getting their Bossam, which is Braised Pork Belly served with butter lettuce, oysters, kimchi, ginger green onion sauce, hoisin and their house sauce. The way they prepare their pork is different than other Korean restaurants because it's not boiled down then sliced. It arrives at your table in all of it's 2 pound glory, smothered in sauce and served with tongs for shredding. Yes it's 2 lbs so it's more than enough food for 5-6 people, even 8 people if you're ordering other items on the menu. I do recommend getting it for larger parties because it racks up to be about $130+ for one order. This was probably the best thing I ate that day and I would come back just to eat this with my group, but probably nothing else.",1.0
"Outstanding food and SERVICE!!!!  I don't usually like buffets, but the Bacchanal is COMPLETELY different.  The seafood (shrimp, crab legs, oysters) are out of this world.  There is a great assortment of food.  It has the look and feel of a high-end NYC restaurant.",1.0
"An Asian fusion restaurant offering the best ramen in Cleveland you'll find, with decent, but slightly overpriced, sides.

Xinji is a new restaurant that fills Cleveland's lack of decent ramen. The establishment has unique offerings of different Asian dishes inspired by a variety of different countries, garnished with a modern American style.

Walking inside, the restaurant gives off a modern vibe, with its brick wall, an environment with hustle and bustle, and selection of unique furniture and furnishing. Our waitress was to the point and quick.

We had spicy pork dumplings, which were boiled dumplings in hot sauce, similar to traditional Sichuan Spicy wontons, but without the normal heat or flavor that Sichuan roasted chili oil entails. The wrap was a bit too chewy for my preference, and the meat tasted slightly overcooked. The spicy sauce didn't leave much of an impression, but was overall decent. Adding to the dish, was the unique addition of cabbage, mushroom, and pickled cucumber.

Their ramen broth are all derived from chicken, steering away from the more commonly seen pork broth offered at other locations. The broth offers a cleaner, less fatty finish that other ramen lovers may be used to. I ordered the shio (salt) ramen, which is a lighter taste compared to the shoyu and miso broths, that tend to be darker in flavor.

Chicken is hard to get right- the shio ramen was served with cuts of chicken which were surprisingly tender, given the difficulty in cooking the meat. The broth was the best ramen broth offered in Cleveland, and was very flavorful, with hint of creaminess. Overall, I was happy to taste a broth that actually tasted like ramen broth, compared to what other ""ramen"" locations offer. The noodles also had a good chew. I ordered a soy egg with my dish (egg with soy sauce), and it complemented the overall dish well in flavor and texture.

I do admittedly miss the usually creamy, rich broth that tonkotsu ramen offers. Ultimately, for my personal taste, Xinji's ramen is good, but did not leave me with a future craving or lust, and I found myself somewhat bored of the dish halfway.

Overall, I am happy to see a new restaurant offering ramen. Xinji Noodle Bar definitely stands as the best ramen restaurant so far in the Cleveland area, and provides unique options for Asian fusion and ramen with chicken broth. This is the place to be if you are seeking to fulfill some of that ramen craving, as long as you aren't looking for the more creamy, fatty broths (Notably, they do offer pork belly with their miso ramen). The restaurant's sides are slightly pricey, given that it didn't blow our minds, so we likely will skip them at our next go around, but they are certainly worth trying for those curious. As the restaurant is new, I do look forward to see what more they have to offer in quality for their sides to match their current price.",1.0
"The server brought forth five plates of banchan first with a complimentary steamed egg dish.  I was so thrilled with this and absolutely thought that the steamed egg was so delicious!  It was plain steamed egg but I enjoyed its fluffiness and smoothness.  

The banchan included kimchi, fermented bok choy, bean sprouts, eggplant, and apple slices & cucumbers.  The eggplant was a unique one that I enjoyed.

Soon, our gigantic wok of spicy chicken and cheese ring arrived to the table!  It was definitely worthy of photos and videos.  Our extra cheese arrived in a 2-cup measuring cup and the rice cakes in a separate dish.  After turning on the heat on the tabletop BBQ, the server poured in the rice cakes and cooked it for us a little bit.  Unlike my experience at Yoogane, the rest of the cooking was left to us that night.

Once the chicken, rice cakes, cabbage, and onions had been thoroughly cooked in the centre grill and the cheese had melted in the ring, we began eating by taking a piece of the chicken and dipping into the cheese ring to eat.  The cheese had probably been left cooking longer than it should have been because we didn't get the gooey and stringy cheese that we wanted but it was still really delicious.  The cheese smelled amazing!

The tender dark meat chicken pieces, when wrapped around the cheese, were a perfect match of tastes and the cheese helped to take away the slight spiciness of the meat and veggies too.  The rice cakes were also firm and tasted just right.

Seafood Pancakes with Garlic Chives:  This looked amazing and came with a dish of soy sauce and floating garlic chives.  I gobbled up a couple slices of the Seafood Pancakes as I waited for the cheese to melt and this Seafood Pancake was absolutely delicious!  There were just enough shrimps and squid in it with green chives and the pancake itself was also thin and not greasy!  It had been a while since I had last had a really delicious and well made Seafood Pancake and I could confidently say that I had found it.  Yay!",1.0

Revised to 4 stars! Big thank you to Paul the owner for reaching out. I value guest service\/guest loyalty and appreciated that he offered to take another look at my screen (was not expected or looking for). His team went ahead and replaced the screen and so far so good, no bad news to report!

The replacement screen is much better quality than the previous screen. It's not difficult to type anymore and the touch screen actually picks up the letters I'm trying to type. The screen no longer freezes and does not go black\/fade in and out when I make phone calls.

"Came here with my cousins for some sweet treats. I ended up with s'mores gelato, it was tasty, but wasn't as creamy as I would of liked or expected. Kind of gummy, almost like they added some sort of gelatin in it. However if you check in with Yelp, you get a free macaroon with a $15 purchase, and we tried the lavender honey one; great flavor. If anything I'd come back for the macaroons as they were more of a bake shop then an ice cream spot.",1.0
"After a long and hot drive to get to Vegas, and then a very long e-checkin line at the Bellagio, we were quite hungry and immediately went to look for something to eat. We were dressed in resort casual attire, and we were hoping to hit our regular dinner spot but found the wait too long, so we decided to try Harvest, mostly because there was no line, no wait - shocking for 9:00 on a Saturday night! We were immediately seated, but while reviewing the menu, our waiter slyly insulted my husband's attire, stating that ""my friends make fun of me for dressing like a 15-year-old boy, too!"" I'm proud of my hubby for not letting the pretentious, middle-aged-male server's bad attitude ruin our night - we were just too tired and hungry- but it did resonate with us the entire stay at the ""resort hotel,"" and, frankly dinner didn't taste so great after that!  

So, needless to say, service (server) was terrible, food was dry, and, overall, not favorably memorable at all.",1.0
"My family and I were craving Korean food and this was one of the few places that was opened on Easter Sunday. The place is a good size for a family-run restaurant. The decoration was okay, modern and clean. We were seated immediately when we got there. 

We ordered a bunch of stuff to share amongst the 4 of us: Chaban Dolsot Bibimbap ($11.99), Seafood pancake ($14.99), Pork Bone Soup ($8.99), Bean Curd Dreg Stew ($10.99), LA Kalbi ($18.99). 

The chaban Dolsot bibimbap was highly recommended by yelpers and it sure was the best dish of the night! There was quite alot of ""filling"" or meats\/veggies and an egg in the dish. The rice at the bottom was crispy, which is my favourite part of the dish. 

The Pork Bone Soup was very disappointing. This is my dad's favourite dish and he was quite excited to eat it when it was served to him boiling. However, as he took a few bites, he complained that it was COLD on the INSIDE. We all took a few bites and we thought the same. The soup might look boiling on the outside, but it is obvious they just reheated the meat and didn't boil it long enough. We called one of the waiters over and told him our concern, but he didn't really know how to deal with it. In fact, he looked scared that he might need to give this dish for us for free. He just stood there for a few seconds didn't know what to do or say (no, there wasn't a language barrier as he could speak English very fluently). So we suggested that he reboils the PBS. He gladly agreed to do so. 

The seafood pancake was also very good! It was eggy and fluffy, just the way my family likes it. There was a good amount of seafood in it. I liked how it wasn't oily at all. 

This restaurant was one of the few restaurants that served my favourite Bean Curd Dreg Stew. It is basically grounded up tofu stew with meat and kimchi. As expected, it came boiling (literally bubbling everywhere). I've had this stew many times in Korea, but this one tasted very weird to me. I am not sure what it was, perhaps the tofu? The taste was off. 

My mom ordered the LA kalbi because she saw another table order it and it looked delicious. It wasn't anything special; it was pricey and it was quite salty to me. 

THE PROBLEM:  
Several hours after the meal, my dad started having abdominal pain, diarrhea, and all sorts of food poisoning symptoms. Then, a little while later, both my mom and brother experienced the same thing as well. We were trying to figure out which dish had the problem and we concluded that the PBS might be problem because they all had the most and I only had a spoonful. Not sure if it was because they didn't boil it enough in the first run or it was just NOT MADE FROM SCRATCH and JUST REHEATED IT, but it scared us a lot. 

Because of our food poisoning experience, we will definitely NOT return. Also, Overall, everything here was $1-2 more than other Korean restaurants and other places had better quality of food and service.",1.0

I booked in advance as this was for his 30th birthday and wanted to have the best experience. We arrived on time for our reservation yet waited for almost 15 minutes to be seated.

In terms of atmosphere, the AC didn't seem to be working well (it was stuffy), there was a ton of random food scraps all over the floors, and there were a bunch of fruit flies buzzing around. Not a great vibe. Totally get that this is a chain restaurant but honestly expected more.

We ordered a bunch of apps and drinks to start, no issues there. When our meals arrived, my lobster tail was way way overcooked. I wasn't going to say anything but my fiance noticed and made a point to let the waitress know. She was kind enough to remove the entree from our bill without him having so ask so that was appreciated. She did also offer to have the kitchen re-fire another one but I didn't want everyone else to have to wait for me to finish eating.

"How can I just find this place? It's pretty amazing. 

I had the coconut soup with vegetable, as suggested by my server. It was WONDERFUL! Just right amount of sourness and saltiness in this flavorful coconut soup base. All kinds of vegetables were included. I was surprised! And they have an option for cup sized soup, which a lot of places don't offer but perfect for a side dish for a single person! Awesome!

My entree was the eggplant dish with tofu, mild. Delicious! The flavor was a little bit on the strong side, but balanced perfectly with the relatively bland eggplant and tofu. Their rice was great too! You can tell if an Asian restaurant is good or bad just by tasting their rice, for it's such an important but skillful main dish for all Asian cuisine. They did a great job. I was really satisfied.

And before the check, my server brought me a small cup of coconut ice cream, and told me it was free for all their customers. I was sold! The ice cream was very tasty too, with pineapple and coconut pieces in it! My FAVORITE! Yum! I came here pretty late at night, but they never tried to rush me out the door, and treated me very politely and nicely instead. I'm very glad I came here tonight.

We ordered the lobster pan roast, Alaskan white clam chowder, and clam linguini. They were all delicious, but I do have to say the pan roast was my favorite. Every dish is flavorful and very generous with the proportions of seafood they have! You pick your level of spice, and since I usually go with mild I went with a 3 which was perfect for me. My friend chose 5 for his Alaskan chowder, and you can definitely already taste the kick!

"Solid 3.5 ... better than your average Starbucks

Streetsville really only has 2 coffee options.  A Second Cup with a nice large outdoor patio and then this Starbucks which is a tad further south in an interesting older building.  With most Starbucks, you get a moderately ok drink... sometimes it can be too watery and lacking flavour or it tastes a bit burnt.  Or worse, the place is an utter mess.  NOT this place... this place is super clean, bright, lots of good seating, and fairly well made drinks.  One of the better starbucks I've been to in Mississauga.

This Starbucks has many things going for it... large interior, lots of windows, and an outdoor patio just for this location alone.  Street parking can be a bit painful but there is some public ones just west of Queen st tucked behind the stores.  The staff here kept the place quite clean... I never say a single table with just used cups anywhere and all the garbage cans weren't overflowing.  If anything, we saw them change them a few times we were here.

When we first walked up stairs, we were quickly greeted and after deciding for chai lattes, the barista quickly started to make the drinks.  Shortly under a few minutes, we had fresh hot and well balanced chai lattes.  It wasn't too sweet, watery, or bitter.  I would say its one of the better ones nearby.",1.0

When she came to pick up the vehicle, after they called and said it was repaired, she inspected the vehicle (BEFORE LEAVING THE PREMISES) and noticed the original electrical problems were still present AND NOW THERE WAS A BROKEN DRIVER'S DOOR.

"For anyone who may be feeling like they're in a rut of eating the usual burger and fries, the 5pc cevapi (like a more flavourful cheeseburger) and potato burek from the take-out section at the back of this deli made for a really nice change of pace.  They were $6.99 a piece, but the portions were enough for two meals.

There was a nice police presence to guide traffic, but they obviously weren't needed. I agree with other viewers that the song choice was a little odd, but honestly I found it refreshing! I mean how over played is Frosty the Snowman? I loved how the lights were synced to the music and the beats on non-Christmas songs is wayyy better anyways! The drive took about 20 minutes with ample photo ops and then we hung out in the holiday lane area for another 15 min or so. You can play in the bounce castles, drink hot chocolate or visit santa.

"Wow. Been waiting for this place to open since i was still living in california. And finally now that i live here it finally opens as i was driving by. And yes i was craving for some kbbq. So to start off. As it just opened. They do really need more staff as i can see later on.  This place will get busy. 
So on with the food right. Brisket...pretty damn good and might i add very consistent. Not like other kbbq when you order your second and third serving the quality tends to deminish or you get not so great cuts. Here it was marble through out my stay. Other meats that i order. Beef belly. Real good. Beef tongue, was not chewy and sliced well where when cooked was real soft and didnt have a gamey taste. Bulgogi was amazing. Not too sweet or too salty...seriously beat out Gen on this. And as for ban chans...kimchi was ok,pickled cucumber was pretty good and just normal stuff.
Pricewise its pretty much like most kbbqs around the area. Im loving the fact these are popping up giving more options to the valley. Yelp elitist...take advantage now while the meat is consistent. Cause really. You never know how new places will end up in 2 months time",1.0

No kidding, I could do all of my Christmas shopping here! My 10-year old son & I spent an hour grabbing a few items, sampling cheese, bread, sushi, popcorn, duck breast and ice cream. After we shopped, we had some sushi rolled and we ate it upstairs and looked down at all of the excitement below. The way everything is merchandised is really spectacular. You could tell patrons at the bar were there for nibbles and drinks, not shopping. How cool that people come here to hang out! I love Acme, don't get me wrong, but this Market District appeals to me on all levels. From the beautiful reclaimed dining tables, to the variety of seating, artwork, displays, lighting, food options, sales and other foodie gadgets, this place is a shopping wonderland!

"I cannot believe how amazing of a job this shoe repairman does on his shoe repairs. Definitely the best I have ever seen! My shoe repair turned out far better than I was expecting and will definitely bring more. See my pictures to see how they fixed my Italian made Oxford shoe. This shoe was in terrible shape. I wish I had a before and after image.  I had him add a rubber sole and heal, fix the inner liner, bring back the colour and finish on the upper leather, and make it look as close to new as possible. Cost was $95 for a full redo which is definitely worth it considering the cost of buying a new pair of similar shoes. Highly recommended!",1.0

First of all, It's not the cleanest, glasses with finger prints on them, dirty plates, plates presentation is inconsistent and all over the place.
Large menu with some really wide selections, the menu is all in chinese language with very little english, so unless you know your chinese cuisine, you'll probably be lost in translation.
Customer service is poor, a lot of it has to do with the language barrier probably. Prices are okay, average and you do get bigger portions for what it's worth.

"I went here to ask questions about a prescription  before having the med filled that the PA  prescribed and didn't explain.
So I asked the lady, Nadia, who called me up to give her my prescription. 
I immediately asked her about what the prescription was composed of and that I would need to know due to allergies.  She immediately told me to go sit down and my question would be answered after the med was filled. I waited for a bit and came up when it was ready- I repeated what she told me that my question would be answered after it was filled and she just blankly looked at me and told me that I needed to pay for the prescription and did not refer me to anyone- like the pharmacist to answer my question.
She gave me a receipt and put a sticker with her name on it telling me to rate my experience and that it would help her.
I stepped out of the Walgreens and I opened up a prescription and I was allergic to the antibiotic in the composition of the med.

"Interesting concept. Came with a bunch of coworkers for lunch. Wide open warehouse with food stalls. Each one is order\/pay separate. While it looks like a place that would cater to the local work lunch crowd, at 11:30 on a Wednesday it was dead and many of the stalls had closed signs. It would also be nice if there was someone or maybe a sign to explain the concept and what there was. Didn't really want to wander around to much and figure it out or why nothing was open. We all grabbed food from different places. I got curry noodles from the latin\/asian place. They didn't have many drink sections, looked like coke bottles, green tea cans and bottled water. Each place had different selections so you would have to pay at a different place if you wanted something different to drink what they had. The burger place was open and most people ordered from there. The burgers looked good but the fries that I snagged from my coworker were not good, I really didn't know fries could be bad but it was almost like they were hollow. It was odd. Lunch for a noodle bowl with some veggies and 3 shrimp was a little prices. around $18 for the ice tea and small bowl. It is a neat concept and we will give it a try again, probably not if we are in a rush though, all the food came at different times and some took quite a while despite there being hardly anyone there.",1.0
"We all probably came here for the light bulb-shaped bottles, but Mr. Tea actually has delicious milk tea! Boba shops have been popping up left and right in Las Vegas, but surprisingly I found Mr. Tea to have the most potential. 

First, they advocate #fightpowder by making fresh mango, taro, and strawberry syrups daily, which not many places do. Second, they are appealing to the public with their unique light bulb-shaped bottles and their obsession with matcha lattes. 2016 was definitely the year of super foods and all things matcha. Mr. Tea is smart to feature matcha lattes but with a twist --including strawberry (homemade syrup) matcha latte, banana matcha latte, coffee matcha latte, and etc.

DRINKS: I purchased the jasmine green milk tea with boba and matcha latte with grass jelly; $6.69 each in the light bulb-shaped bottles. The jasmine milk tea was better than your average because I was able to taste the premium green tea leaves. The sugar level was perfect, not too sweet but not too bitter either. I actually prefer my drink to have a stronger tea flavor, so if you're like me then ask them to put less milk. Also get light ice because they went hard with filling it up with ice; I'm usually a slow drinker, so you would expect my ice to melt, but actually a good amount of ice was left over. The matcha latte was my favorite because of how strong the matcha flavor was, or maybe they just put a big scoop (not sure to be honest). Regardless, it tastes like your average matcha latte but with a more bitter taste, which I dig. My only compliant is how hard their boba is. I was very disappointed because their drinks are delicious but I had to really work my jaw to chew the boba. 

SERVICE: Everyone was very friendly and attentive. I'm guessing they are still training since not all the staff were knowledgable with making the drinks yet. One female had to repeat the drink instructions like 3 times before my drink came out. It came out yummy so I'm not mad LOL. 

ATMOSPHERE: A very earthy and calm environment. They decorated the shop with everything green --green walls, green fake plants-- and wooden chairs & tables. I love this because it's so inviting and chill. 

OVERALL: I'll definitely be back to try their split-cup drinks, the fairy grass dessert (it has sweet potato, red beans, green beans, taro, and grass jelly I think), and the strawberry matcha latte.",1.0

It was my second time visiting this location. The parking lot can be dangerous. Whomever designed this parking lot was on some hallucinogen, I reckon.

"Prestonfield is one of those places determined to make an impression on you from the second you arrive at the premises. Being winter, we arrived after dark, and to see it emerge as we drove up the driveway was... stunning. When entering, we're greeted by several members of staff before being shown into a side room to wait for our table, accompanied by drinks and nibbly bits. 

Nibbly bits, I probably needed to come up with something more ostentatious as a description, but hey ho.

Then we were shown into a dining room that was as pomp and circumstance as it gets. Lit by candlelight, I'll admit we were both dazzled and navigating closely set tables was a bit challenging. Nonetheless, despite the number of tables, the darkness made it still feel us feel separated and having our own experience, rather than shared with others. 

Dinners wise we had the option of the Christmas or A La Carte menu, which was wonderful, for my partner loves to have a non Christmas meal for his birthday. Vegetarian options were lovely, and my partner loved his pheasant boudin. We shared the tarte tatin for dessert, a lovely showpiece to (almost) finish the meal... but as a grande finale, the SR was presented with a slate celebtrating his birthday. Always cute, always appreciated.

Inside are rows of rounded booths which I also loved. For my first Dim Sum experience, I wanted to go in with an open mind and try anything that was put in front of me. I figured, if it's on a menu and people order it, there must be something to it. And I'm glad I did! I tried so many new things, and a few (I'm embarrassed to say) I don't remember what it was, but I'll try to recap. My ultimate favourite, the special bbq pork bun, was something like I've never had before. Sweet and savoury at the same time, it really was the world's best bun! :) Beef rice noodle roll, pork and shrimp crispy spring rolls, mushroom and vegetable dumplings, chickens feet (which I never thought I'd try, less enjoy..!), pork and shrimp shumai, and some cute little deep fried pear-shaped pork dumpling thingys that were just the best! I also had my first congee which I quite enjoyed. I think it was the lobster, clam and fish. To finish, I tried the deep fried durian cake (!!). Surprisingly, it wasn't half bad! Sure, I smelled cat pee for the next half hour coming from nowhere, but I'm still happy I tried it.

Since I am trying to get over a bad cold, I caved in to my daughter's request for a ""ramen place"" in hopes for some ""comfort soup"".

Wasn't too crazy about my curry ramen...I expected a more brothy kind of soup, but it was more of a thick curry soup.  My daughters spicy-spicy Fiery Ramen was no joke...It left a burning\/tingling sensation in my throat for 10 min...and my husband was content with his miso.  I was disappointed in the Karaage Chicken, I expected a bursting with flavor experience from the photos, but it was ""good"" (c'mon!  I wasn't feelin it) not great...fried oysters, good...Moko bun, delicious!  I also ordered Oolong tea, and expected it to be a ""hot"" tea.

"So this is a new-er subway because it used to be a Starbucks while I was in high school. I come here every so often because I love subway. But this review solely goes for my visit last night after midnight. We originally wanted to get Faustos, but it was closed. I'm glad we ended up at Subway because we stumbled upon some awesome awesome service by an awesome person. Oh, and I learned how to finally pay by apple phone, which is really amazing by the way...wish you were there to see my reaction, lol.


I've been in the food industry so I completely understand when it comes to being the only one working. It was after midnight so usually it takes more time to get things done especially when there are more than 1 guest in the place. Well, we came in and there was another girl ordering two sandwiches and we didn't mind at all. We knew it was going to take a bit, most people would just walk out and go somewhere else. He was super sweet to her and I he also acknowledged that he would be right with us. 

When it was our turn he first washed his hands (that's good because you notice a lot of  people don't do that) and helped out with the menu because I had a few questions. I got a white flat bread with tomato sauce, pepperoni, provolone and mozzarella cheese, toasted, with extra banana peppers. And well, he filled that sucker up with everything! It was like a little pizza sandwich which I really enjoyed. When I said extra, he really put some lovin' into it, and I was really happy. That's how you do it. Make your customers happy. My boyfriend got the oven roasted chicken with a bunch of veggies (and fresh veggies at that) and he was definitely very generous with his sandwich as well.

Time to pay and this guy was just really sweet. I told him since I had never tried apple pay with the little monitor thing that I wanted to try it. He was helpful with that and within a second my food was paid for. Shocked because that was a lot faster than taking out my card and putting in the chip in and waiting for it to approve and say ""remove card"" which takes forever by the way. Hoping many other places consider having an apple pay reader.

Well, I was completely satisfied with this visit and I felt like he deserved a darn well good review because a lot of people don't recognize this kind of service.

"Twist is a gorgeous, sleek restaurant on the 23rd floor of the equally gorgeous and sleek Mandarin Oriental.  The views from the hotel, restaurant, and yes even the restroom are breathtaking.  This restaurant is 1 to 2-Michelin worthy for their creativity in their dishes. I think the Grand Tasting Menu can rival L'Atelier's.  After all, the owner is Pierre Gagnaire, famous 3-Michelin Chef from France. Their Vegetarian Tasting Menu however was just okay to me and didn't have the same wow factor, despite being half the price of the Grand Menu. Our party of six ordered five Grand Tasting Menus (5 stars) and One Vegetarian Tasting Menu (3 stars) - so that's a weighted average of 4.67 stars rounding up to 5.

SERVICE (5 stars)
Top notch!  Servers explained every dish in detail, were patient and friendly.  One waiter even helped direct my mom to the restroom, by escorting her by the arm!

AMUSE BOUCHE (5 stars)
We got some amazing small bites here.  This tiny radish tart that was super refreshing and like eating an entire salad with one bite (my sister's words!).  The olive and gin martini jello shot on a stick was amazing, something like a cocktail for astronauts.

VEGETARIAN TASTING MENU (3 stars)
Like I said, good but nut great.  Many preparations relied on tartness and acidity to add flavors to the veggies.  My personal favorites were the beetroot, pumpkin (reminds me of soft tofu with truffles), and the tortellini.

GRAND TASTING MENU (5 stars)
This is highly recommended!  Lots of seafood, proteins, and creative use of fruits and veggies.  Most dishes 5 stars, a few 4 stars.  My favorites were the lobster (perfectly cooked and tender) and venison saddle (seared and incredibly juicy).  The side dishes were likewise awesome, especially the chilled green bean with almonds with some serious crunch and flavor.

GRAND DESSERTS (5 stars)
Both tasting menus gives five desserts, which were recommended to be eaten in a certain order.  Servers arranged them in a circle, and suggested we start at 6-o clock and eat clockwise.  My favorites were the first (coconut tapioca), third (chartreuse) and fifth (red fruit with chocolate ganache).  Flavors went from slightly sweet and fruity, to tart, and finally ending on richness. And that's not all - you get four more piece of candy after dessert.",1.0
Nice addition to the neighborhood. Been there 3 time now and a good meal each time. My wife loved the vegetarian meals on the menu.  Also finally a place that when you ask for spicy you get it. So many places don't give you spicy even when you asked for it. Looking forward to trying more on the menu,1.0
"Yelp's reviews are why we chose Cali Pools, so I figured I should leave a review myself. 

Design: 
  I spent months envisioning how I wanted my pool\/yard to look. Marv really listened and did a really great job of putting that into his design. Marv was a pleasure working with. 

I won't throw another company under the bus, but I had probably the opposite experience with another reputable company in town - that company came back with a design that wasn't even close to what I described. I then tried on two more appointments to let that company fix things. Second appt - I physically drew all over their proposed design, and then on the third visit when I could basically assume that person had thrown my sketch and notes in the garbage and was even farther away from my vision. (I wanted to walk out of their office on the spot but my husband wanted a second quote to make sure we didn't overpay). 

Price: 
  The other company tried to make their pool seem cheaper by cutting out a lot of things I wanted, using cheaper materials, and by making the pool 30-40% smaller (all while repeatedly telling me their pool is 'huge'). 
  When both quotes were adjusted to the same size and materials they would've been within 1%.  I personally really liked the honesty of cali pools. 

Project Manager:
Kevin is very good at his job.  (I hope they pay you well, Kevin - you deserve it!) Kevin always responded timely - sometimes late at night and weekends with any question we had. He does an amazing job of keeping contractors on schedule. Our pool started two months AFTER our neighbors and finished one day BEFORE! Our pool is also bigger and has a more complex design. 

Summary: 
Our pool was completed two months ago and we couldn't be happier!",1.0
"Dr. Simon, SAVED MY LIFE, emergency surgery; I had never been in so much pain in my life, I went to the hospital in agony.  After many tests and many hours later, they
 hospital discovered I had a problem, then they needed to find a surgeon.  YIPPEE, the hospital found Dr. Irwin Simon, he was so compashionate,  kind, he explained the entire procedure, I was terrified and he put my fear to rest.

"Came here during their soft opening as they called it.

The concept sounded ok but when we went it was nearly deserted, save for a table that was given VIP service at the back.  It emptyness of the restaurant gave an uncomfortable vibe.

Anyways, the menu states that the signature cheese ribs has a minimum 2 order.  This stipulation meant that we were limited to just ordering that.  It was later on when another table came in that a customer inquired and the server said you could order one order of the cheese ribs but that it wouldn't be very much.  Well, it would've been nice to be given that option!

The presentation was nice, you get a large plate that has the cheese and corn, then the ribs on top.  The side dishes were small and not enough for two.  Imagine a spoonful of mashed potatoes spread thin, that's what we got.

The sides were: boiled sliced carrots, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, corn and one egg.  While the serving of cheese and corn (mixed in) was good for two, the other sides were very small.  

Each serving had 4 ribs which were alright but expensive for what we got.  There was one male server with glasses, he was pleasant and helpful.  

I got annoyed that the neighbouring table was checked and asked frequently how they were enjoying their meal and feedback was given.  We weren't asked how our meal was until the end.  Oh yeah, that table that the server was keen to speak with to get feedback, they got free desserts as compensation for their feedback and she was unhappy with her meal.  

I expressed the same comment, it was expensive for what we got and the fact that theres a minimum 2 per order for the cheese ribs is a setback.  But we didn't get a dessert.  Oh well.  

If you go this week during their soft opening, there's a 10% discount.  We ordered two pops but the pricing was different.  When I asked, the response didn't make sense, but whatever.  Supposedly, the menu may be a bit different when they get the knots worked out.",1.0

Waltzed on in before a concert for a cocktail and a snack! The food and the cocktails are amazing! I asked the bartender Shawn for a shot that would go with my beer choice. Needless to say he delivered! The ambience is what you would want! It has an established vibe. I am planning on coming back for Mothers Day as their menu looks fabulous! Please check them out and support local Mesa businesses as this place is exactly what this city needs.,1.0
"After my first visit to Republic and having the Rooster's call, the aroma of this place really made me want to come back and eat in. We came in for breakfast on mothers day and ordered 4 Rooster's Call, 1 Dana (meat manaeesh with pickled wild cucumber, radish and parsley) for dad, 2 Hen's Nests (a breakfast manaeesh with egg, feta and arugula) for my wife and mom and 1 Aida (spinach manaeesh with feta cheese and walnuts) for me! 
I think my dad said it best when he described the food as being, 'just like home'. I believe he has secretly gone here a few times since!! 
Everything was just delicious with the flavours of Lebanon and the Arabian peninsula. Perfectly cooked manaeesh with just the right amount of filling. Come in a group, eat everything....  
This absolutely has to be the best manaeesh in the city! My new favourite cafe and for those who have spent any time in the Middle East, go here, sit and close your eyes while you eat, it will take you right back there. Toronto, say hello to your new favourite Lebanese cafe!
Highly recommend this place",1.0
"Sake Rok is a good time! It's basically dinner AND a show! There's a live DJ and loud music, so you are automatically put into a party mood and environment! All the food was delicious, but I was a little disappointed with the service. We ordered edamame, which was listed as a starter and is typically served before sushi, but we did not get it until the end of the meal after reminding our waitress. Although we were just a table of two, and didn't have the biggest bill, it was apparent that our waitress was catering to those with a larger bill and didn't check-in throughout the meal unless we flagged her down for refills on water or to check on our food. All of that being said, Sake Rok was a great and fun way to kickstart our Saturday night and Vegas, but the service does leave something to be desired.",1.0
Tamara was not customer friendly.  Right when I got up to the register she had attitude.  When I tried bringing something to her attention her attitude even got worst.  I very seldom go to Walmart and with this kind of service I received today it doesn't look like I'll b going back in the near future.  So if you are in line and see Tamara run!!!!,1.0
"The experience was nice, but it was far too expensive. Out the door it was $120 for a shellac manicure. Less than a week later one nail has completely chipped off and a few more are are chipping. I've paid $25 at other salons where the polish lasts for 3 weeks.",1.0
"I'm updating this review in hopes of saving my local breakfast joint. I've been going here for 7 years now, and I've always really enjoyed it. However, over the past year I've noticed a steady decline, that I feel compelled to acknowledge. This place was always a little dingy, in kind of an endearing way, but it's starting to get to the point where it distracts you from your meal. I feel the service has remained pretty consistent, not terrible not great. But the food has also started to become a little suspect. For instance, the burgers used to be fresh beef and our last order were frozen hockey pucks. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy Eggs r' us, however, I hope the owners start investing more time, energy and resources into their business and resurrect it back to greatness, because if they continue to leave it untouched, this local breakfast Favorite will turn into just another strip mall eye sore.",1.0
"This is a place I was REALLY looking forward to visiting since it is finally close enough for me to get to it. We ordered the cereal milk, cereal milk soft serve, crack pie, crack pie milkshake, and a corn cookie. The cereal milk and corn cookie were definitely my favorites. The crack pie milkshake was SUPER sweet, and for that reason I didn't have a bite of the pie. The cereal milk soft serve was good, served with lots of cereal piled on top and in the bottom of the cup. I guess my only complaint is that for the price, it wasn't quite as mind blowing as I had hoped. Next time I would like to try the cake bites and will have another cereal milk and some corn cookies.",1.0
"Went there last night for the first time.  Not impressed at all.  Sat in the sushi bar and it took a while to get attention.  Staff seemed overwhelmed.  Platters piled up on top of the sushi bar waiting for the waiters to carry them to the tables.  Sushi chef behind the bar yelling directions to the staff through a two-way radio.  Was a bit of a mad house.  Had the sushi boat for two and it is on par with supermarket sushi.  Not better.  No wasabi or ginger. They clearly have to still get their game together.  Until then, thanks but no thanks.",1.0
"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much sums up everything about my experience with their food.

I use Margherita pizza as a baseline for my pizza reviews, because A)  I love Margherita pizzas, and B)  if you fuck up a Margherita pizza then you're pretty much showing your ass.

Theirs was a typical slapdash pizza- covered in heavy cheese (which leads to a heavy sheen of oil), sprinkled heavily with powdered basil, with a slice of roma tomato on each pizza slice. A Margherita pizza is a special thing, and it's *SO* easy to get right that when you get it wrong, it's a huge turnoff for me. It's not that tough- start with a good sauce, put a few dollops of good mozzarella, and a few leaves of fresh basil. Booyakasha. Not this overcheesed, oily monstrosity.

Their penne with meatballs was also quite mediocre, but the meatballs themselves weren't terrible. So maybe 2.5 stars, but definitely not 3.",1.0
"I am completely new to this area and to this salon and Salon 42 was so welcoming from the minute I walked in! I really loved the decor and I loved Stephanie more!

"If you're looking for a Vegas wedding that's more classy, elegant and romantic than drive-thru and Elvis-led, then this is your bag! We'd always dreamed of getting married in a garden, and once we discovered the Primrose Courtyard here we knew that was it :) 

I could rave at length about Becky Salvo and how easy she made the arrangements for me to organise from London (god I love someone who can reply and edit long email chains well!). The venue was every bit as stunningly beautiful as I'd hoped on the day, our guests were totally blown away right from when they entered the hotel, the flowers and corsages were gorgeous and the bridal dressing room a real treat for me and my girls. Our Reverend Richard Walter was a total class act - a bit of a hippy at heart I think, he was amazing in the lead up to the big day and extremely encouraging when we told him we wanted to write most of our ceremony ourselves. If our vows didn't have everyone welling up already, his meaningful words tipped most people over the edge!

I couldn't have been happier on the day itself but there were a couple of niggles that make this 4-stars and that people should be aware of. First is that absolutely every little thing on top of your package price is chargeable, and usually with a fat price tag. I know that's obvious, but it includes for example setting out the right number of chiavari chairs for your party. We eloped with 12 guests and they charged us a frankly outrageous amount to reduce the chair count down from 100 - which would've just looked ridiculous. Second is that all d√©cor and photography must be done through Wynn. We went for a lower-priced package and added d√©cor options a la carte (which adds up very quickly so just be aware before you commit). It was the photo\/videography that bugged me though as I just don't think their (Cashman's) video work is very good - the cameras stay stationery so the one at the back is annoyingly visible in most of the aisle photos and similar of the ones at the altar. They also add another big fat price tag if you actually want your photos. We booked a separate photographer for before and after the ceremony instead who has taken the most wonderful photos for us, so I doubt we'll pay for all the ceremony shots.

I'd still do it all again in this venue in a heartbeat as it's probably the most beautiful place to get married on the whole strip and a pretty damn perfect day - it was a one-time kinda thing for us though ;)",1.0
I LOVE this shop! Always the best price and the owner is hands on. PLUS there is a women's automotive class on Saturdays to learn about your car and what you need to know to about your car and how to be aware when a mechanic is trying to sell you more than you need!! He's the only one in NV that does this class!! Take a Saturday morning and check it out! If not...at least make him your mechanic!,1.0

"This place is pretty bad. Lipstick on a pig. I brought my friends from San Fran here hoping to entertain and showcase a good palate. Big let down. It's a 20 dollar charge a plate with a 5 dollar atmosphere and a 2 dollar chef. The faves were subpar and the bruschetta was so bad that the waitress and chef said wow can't believe we served that all night and removed it from the tab with a laugh. That's it. 
Don't get the flight of whatever that prison moonshine swill is. It's not an acquired taste. It's gross. I've waited a week to leave this review because I was so upset. Don't go here. Just go to Postino or Culinary Dropout.  Go to Rula Bula or RA or Fuzzy's even. Jimmy John's is better.

"I started going to Rita for electrolysis for my full arms around three years ago, after having no success with laser hair removal (several different places and machines) and after being left with bad scarring with other electrologists in London, Ontario and Toronto. Rita was very professional during my initial consult and answered all of my questions thoroughly. She told me that there's no way anyone should be burned or scarred during electrolysis if the procedure is being done properly. I was very impressed by her knowledge, and confidence to eliminate my arm hair, and began going for sessions regularly starting at the end of 2013. After about a year and a half of regular treatments, I was almost hair free! I have never had any scarring, burns, the treatment is relatively painless, and I now only need to go one or two times a year when I want a touch up. The difference has been REMARKABLE and after years of wasting money on laser, I am SO happy I was able to find Rita. 

RIta is highly skilled, professional, gentle, and easy to talk to, and will definitely make sure you see results with each treatment. I HIGHLY recommend her to anyone wanting a permanent hair  removal solution!",1.0

It is obvious they have changed food vendors - not the same quality.  Visit before this one we ordered carrot cake ""it is not in season""....really?  Tonight we sat in view of the kitchen - food consistently sat in the window (while servers waiting on food did not expedite to the waiting tables) - fish sat in the window for 10 min, steak sat in the window for 10 min waiting on a baked potato.....as fast as restaurants turn over in Chandler, if DC Steakhouse doesn't assess  quality and refocus on service, they may not be around to benefit from the new entertainment district under construction to the North.",1.0

I also went ahead and picked up an order of cheese enchiladas and loaded Nachos. While my husband said the Tacos were pretty decent, everything else was disappointing. When did every Mexican restaurant decide that it was ok to serve Cheese that hasn't been melted?? It's seriously infuriating and turning me off to Mexican food entirely. Why would I want Nachos or enchiladas with cold shredded cheese?? In the case of the Nachos, they are no longer loaded Nachos - it's just a Nacho salad. Fail. Who will right this wrong?!?",1.0
"I had really high expectations as this one was rated one of the top buffets in Vegas ! I generally do not like buffets but wanted the Vegas buffet experience. 
We went on labour day and unfortunately they had decided to jack up the normal advertised price because it was a statutory holiday even though the place was far from full so it was a little disappointing as it wasn't well advertised when we checked the prices before coming.

So of course walking in it is completely overwhelming with a large variety of basically everything from prime beef, to Macncheese and sushi! It is very attractive and everything looks delicious and well presented.
As you slowly start digging in you quickly realize like most buffets it is a jack of all trade master of none! Everything is kind of good but nothing is really all that exceptional so the feeling of excitement slowly goes down as you get fuller because you want to justify the ridiculous price you paid by stuffing yourself.
Basically my opinion remains the same about buffets and wouldn't go back to this one but it was fun for once !",1.0
"Having been to Hawaii several times and enjoying poke there I was so excited to try this place! Especially after all the great reviews. The Hawaiian poke here though visually* looks awesome the color and everything, but taste wise it didn't have much flavor at all. I was really surprised on that. It made me wonder where they got there fish from and if it was farm raised as well as if dye was added to give the fish that color....And the seaweed was so mushy and I love ordering seaweed at different places.

I ended up not being able to eat it all and tossing it, although I never waste food. So that was a bummer for me. I didn't feel too well afterwards either.

"We have been there a couple of times, and yesterday just didn't do me any favors to entice me to return.  The main problem (which my Mom has also comment on) is the overuse of Salt.  I ordered a Caprese salad and usually it is difficult to mess that up.  The presentation was really nice, but when I bit into it I had an overwhelming taste in my mouth of just salt.  I couldn't even taste the rest of my meal as that took my taste buds off the chart.  I didn't say anything, but if salt is necessary to that extreme then the chef is obviously not tasting their food.  My Mom is salt sensitive and there are health risks in going to the extreme with the salt.  I may try it again someday but not in the near future.",1.0

"Finally reached a point where I'm giving up on what I thought was going to be my go-to pho spot. I've eaten in once and ordered takeout probably 6 times and for some reason there's always an issue. 
I've ordered the same thing every time: 2 orders of pho ga (chicken pho). Pretty straightforward, no special requests, no apps, etc. 
Every time when I get there to pick it up, they only have one order prepared. Waiting for the second order to be wrapped up wouldn't be such a big deal if it didn't happen EVERY SINGLE TIME. 
Tonight, they finally got the order right (encouraging!) but then I got home, unpacked the food and couldn't have been more let down. 
The $21.00 pho dinner consisted of cold broth that had actually separated (greasy fat film on top). The chicken? Well, the chicken was awful. Hard, clumped together & ALSO cold. The bag of stir-in extras was gross too. Old, mushy limes & limp veggies. The one bright spot? The jalape√±o was pretty fresh.

The decors here are okay, nothing outstanding or memorable. The host and waiter were nice and welcoming. I enjoyed the service. 

I came for the paella so that's what I ordered. The paella took about 30 minutes to be made which is reasonable. When it came out, the waiter told us to be careful because it was hot. Turned out, the dish was not hot at all, it was actually quite cold for something that has just been made. I have had paella at other places before and the one here was definitely not the best I have had.  There was not enough seafood for the premium cost and something that should be shared between 2-3 people. The rice was also way too salty for me and my sister, and both of us love salty food. We had to squeeze lime on the dish to make it less salty. The seafood that was used did not taste very fresh neither. Overall, a disappointing paella experience. 

We decided to order the flan and bread pudding for desserts. The flan was very dense and tasted almost like cheesecake. It was actually served with goat cheese. The flan was topped with some roasted nuts (I think pistachio) and the topping tasted really good. I have never had flan this style but it did taste yummy. The bread pudding was okay and was actually not dense enough. The amount of raisins inside the bread pudding was very overwhelming.

"I would give Hertz at SkyHarbor negative one stars if I could. I was warned that they have a sketchy operation there and it turns out I should have listened.

I got a bill 30 days later representing roughly 30% more than I originally paid representing ""return damage."" The car was not damaged in any way. This is simply a scam. I will be disputing the charge on my credit card and hopefully that will work. Hertz appears to know that it's too hard to take them to court over this. Suffice it to say I will never rent from Hertz ANYWHERE again. I was ripped off plain and simple.

The milk glass jugs they come in are cracked and dirty. The black print that is on the glass completely wiped off on my hands when I touched it. And do I have to explain my fruit box I received!

"This is a quintessential old school steakhouse. Definitely make a reservation if you want it to be a more formal dinner-- they take you to the back dining room. There's a more casual space by the bar and thats where you'll see people who like eating steak in their swimsuit cover-ups (not judging-- it's Vegas lol, but if you wanted a ~special~ meal, basketball jerseys sorta kill the vibe). 

Our waitress was top notch and made great wine and cocktail recommendations. I had a negroni that was perfect. We also did a half-dozen oysters with two of each kind they had in rotation. They were wonderful. I got a filet and lobster tail that was about as big as my forearm. All perfectly cooked. The broccolini and mashed potatoes are great and the table next to us had hash browns and seemed really pleased with it (it looked really good). We finished with a slice of chocolate fudge pie and it was wonderful. 

The back dining room was pretty warm and a little stuffy so I had to peel my thighs off the banquette as we were leaving but I imagine a full suit would be uncomfortable (I have no idea how the wait staff was managing). Maybe it was just because it's summer but I'd definitely wear breathable clothes.",1.0
"4121 Main is a special place.

Equal parts shop and coffeeshop, I dare say it's the most beautiful space in the city.  Thanks to the creative vision of co-owner Thommy Conroy, the space is a quirky botanical paradise.  Due to lack of free public wifi -- and space -- it manages to avoid the ""coworking space"" feel of many other coffeeshops in the city.  That said, if you're looking for a place to work all day, this isn't your place. If you're looking for a beautiful space to do some reading or writing, 4121 is perfect.

Now, on to the coffee. I believe the coffee drinks here are the best in the city. Especially their cappucinos and lattes. They use beans from Heart roasters (one of my favorites in the country) and the local Klvn (also very good). They use Snowville Creamery milk. Enough said -- you can taste the difference. Their matcha latte is excellent as well. Also, the drink prices are more reasonable than they are at nearly any other coffeeshop of comparable quality in the city.

They also frequently offer chocolate truffles handmade by Lindsay, one of the baristas who works there. Her truffles are DELICIOUS. I often stop here just looking to see if there are truffles available. There are a variety of tasty craft\/bean-to-bar chocolate bars for sale as well. Be sure to check the prices of these with the barista if you are budget conscious in any way -- these are not your average chocolate bars and range from $9-20, in my experience.

They also let me bring my dog in if I'm getting a drink to go. She enjoys the ever-changing plants and curiosities of the space as much as I do.

I was impressed on the presentation of the items we ordered and I thought the decor they had around the shop was was done very well. 

We tried (1) milkshake, (2) flavors of soft serve, and (1) espresso. Unfortunately for me, the vanilla shake with pretzels was by far the worst shake I've literally ever had.

"Need to update based on our last experience this week.   We showed up around 7:30 on a Tuesday night.  There was a bit of a line but it appeared to be moving fast so we just went with the flow.   Well, we found out this was just the line to pay!  After you paid you get into another line which was 30-45 minutes long!  Talk about your FAKE OUT!   A few things they need to add - first, a sign stating how long the wait is or at least tell us before we plop down $50\/person.   While we were finishing up our transaction, a guest from the VIP line (which you can pay extra for if you want to skip the line.  Kind of like Universal Studio's Front of the Line pass)  was upset his party hadn't been seated yet.  They told him it was a 20 minute wait.   I would have been cranky to pay and extra $10 or $15\/person (I think that was the upgrade) and still wait 20 minutes.  

I felt bad for the 2 families of 5 in front of us.  All they had in the dining room was tables for 4 that they could 'squeeze' another chair in.  It was that or they could wait longer for larger table.  They both took the table for 4 as I'm sure they were cranky about waiting as well.  

When we finally got to our seat (around 8:30ish).   The bottle of water was almost empty so we asked for another one.  The hostess basically stole one from another table and placed our empty one on it.  It took a while for someone to take our drink order, but they did arrive quickly after that.  

The food was actually pretty good, but it might be because we were starving.  The seafood was spot on and the Jerk Chicken was tender and moist.  Great job there.  For us though, the surprise wait was the kicker that basically put us in a bad mood for the evening.  We were glad to get out of there and get back to gambling.",1.0
"Go to the dentist, the eye doctor, the doctor and it's kind of expected to have a long wait be rushed through and hopefully get a moment with the person who's going to diagnose the problem.

This is actually the first time i am using YELP because i dont agree with how this ""manager"" handled this situation and think that customers should know what kind of establishment this place is and how they handle such a severe situation.

"I hate writing one star reviews but I have to be honest here. We had 5 adults in our party on a Saturday night. We were seated right away and did not have to wait. Our waitress was very friendly. The atmosphere was okay, not as intimate as we typically like for a steakhouse. The waitress brought out fresh rolls and honey butter. The rolls were warm, but the taste was a 2 out of 10. I had spaghetti with meat sauce, my in laws had spaghetti with marinara, and my husband and sister in law had ribeye sandwiches. Three of us had side salads, which were great. I enjoyed the balsamic vinaigrette. My spaghetti was terrible. The sauce was extremely sweet. I couldn't eat it. The garlic bread was soggy. My father in laws spaghetti came with a ton of sauce and minimal noodles. He asked for a side of noodles to even it out a bit. The marinara spaghetti was mediocre at best, neither finished their meals. My sister in law ordered the ribeye sandwich well done. It came out medium rare and had to be sent back. The ribeye sandwich had no flavor, except for char. It tasted like bland char. Fries were bland and flavorless.

The low country boil was dry.  Really, food that was supposedly slow boiled came out dry and tasted microwaved, especially the corn and sausage.

"Have been to different CPKs all around town, food is delicious as always. But the service here was terrible!! 

First of, there was a wait which was fine, however I saw two people came in after most of us but were seated before us, they were seated right away. I heard the host asked them ""Did you want to eat here?"" then seated them right away. I don't know what is the whole story with that but even another party looked around like ""Why are they getting a table right away?!"" 

After we were seated the server came up to us immediately and asked for our orders. Everything was find with drink orders and food orders. He told us about the new items and was friendly enough. Our apps came pretty quickly which was nice, when the main courses came, I picked up our empty appetizers plates with the intention of giving the dishes to the food runner because we had no space left on our table, she put the food down on the table and walked away in a rush when I know for a fact that she saw me holding the dirty plates! The plates were huge and the runner was standing right next to me, there was no way that she did not see I was holding the plates, but she just walked away without the picking up the dirty plates. So we stacked the dirty plates to one side ate with very little space, the server eventually came to take the plates away, did not ask us if we needed anything else or how the food was.

The room itself was very clean, neatly appointed, and modern. Everything we needed was there. The bathroom was fresh and modern as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the sliding barn-style door that was in place for the bathroom. I don't not like this type of door typically, but when it was closed completely, there was still a small gap, making it feel less private. If the door had been just slightly wider, or the track just a tad longer, the issue would be fixed. Very minor issue, though.

"I've been here twice in a span of three weeks (with two different friends on Nov 21 and Dec 08).

The first time I tried Onnki Donburi, it was for dinner and the waitress explained that their  weekly donburi changed every week, so I opted for the Gal-B one (Korean Kalbi).  It was super tasty, but probably a bit salty because I remember being pretty thirsty afterwards.  Overall, it was good and I didn't expect any less.

The second time I went was for lunch and I really wanted to try the Salmon Lovers bowl... but... they just sold out right when I was going to order.  I went with the Buta Fire bowl and, while it was good, I think they added too much seasoning because an hour or two afterwards, I was extremely thirsty (can't tell if it's because it was a bit salty or just the fact it was a spicy dish -- I did have about a cup and a half of water while eating).  The heat is just right -- it's one of those bowls where it slowly gets hotter with the more you eat.

Just some comments:
- It's a bit more spacious inside than I thought but seating is still a bit limited (you either sit at the bar and watch them build your bowls or at the back with bar stools).  There's a coat rack near the bathroom for you to hang your jacket.
- The first time I went, the waitresses would refill our cups with water.  The second time I went, I was informed that water was self-serve near the entrance.  Not sure what happened with that to make them change to self-serve, but it's no biggy.",1.0

"Millie's is one of the greatest ice cream places in Pittsburgh. The place has a bright, homey, and welcoming decor, which is only emphasized by the homemade ice cream. The quality of the custard here is top notch, and each flavor's ingredients are explicitly listed so you'll know what you're eating. In my opinion, the waffle cones here do not match up to the ones at Dave & Andy's but the ice cream at Millie's is superior. My squad had ""The Best Hot Chocolate,"" ""Salted Caramel,"" and ""Mint Chocolate."" All fantastic, the but chocolate was the most notable. My only critique was that the Mint Chocolate was not as frozen as the other flavors, and was too wet. Check my photos.

Seriously, Millie's is located among other great Pittsburgh eateries. Finish up your meal, and don't forget to stop by this Grade-A establishment for a summery dessert. If you're not eating a meal but want an excuse for something sweet, go here. Actually, just go here. You won't regret it.",1.0
"My family has ordered several amazing cakes for special occasions from Carlo's since it opened here in Las Vegas at the Venetian. We got beautiful cakes for my engagement party, my baby shower and a few birthdays. 
Just last weekend, August 19, 2017, we ordered another cake with their 'amazing' buttercream frosting. 
Unfortunately, the buttercream frosting recipe has been changed. It has gone from 'amazing' to tasteless Crisco. The cake is so slathered with this lard masquerading as frosting that my 6'3"" 300 pound (very strong) brother could not carry it all the way from the bakery, through the Venetian, to the car. Venetian valet had to get a cart to wheel it to the car, as the bakery did not lift a finger to help.
Not only has the recipe changed for the buttercream frosting but the staff knows it's disgusting and didn't bother informing my mother, when she ordered it, that the recipe had changed about 2 months prior and it wasn't edible. When she called after trying to serve it to 20 people at our joint birthday party event, the woman she ordered it from answered again and admitted she knew it would taste bad but didn't say anything.
The reason it is important to note the fact that the clerk didn't say anything is because as my mom was ordering this LAST cake, she was raving about the buttercream frosting (yes, my mom and I only eat cake for the frosting) and saying how excited she was that all these people she had been bragging to about Carlo's Bakery would now get a chance to taste how amazing the frosting is.
I'm sorry but at this point, if I were taking that order, I would tell the person that they were not going to get the same great buttercream frosting and I would have offered a frosting that did not taste like LARD!!!
To top it all off, the bakery is not willing to refund any of my mom's money, even though we threw away most of it. They would give her a 'discount' off her next order. As if we will  EVER order anything from this bakery again.",1.0

1. Important notes first: Dr. Moss now only does gynecology and she ONLY takes cash or BCBS insurance(I lucked out on this one, because that is the type of insurance I happen to have at this time).

2. If you are a no show for whatever reason, they will never see you as a patient in the future. They let me know this when I first made my appointment and I was ""Dang that is harsh, yo"", but then I appreciated it because it told me that they are a quality office not looking to fuss with people who are not going to value their appointment slot. If you have an emergency and cannot make it in, CALL them ASAP. 

3. Now onto the good stuff. The office is in a nice little medical plaza and is upstairs(take the elevator). The waiting area is kept cold and is clean with plenty of magazines and a t.v. The receptionist was nice enough and check in was a breeze. They do take your photo the first time, for your file. I was not prepared for this, so I probably look a hot mess.

4. You'll first be taken back to a room with an assistant who takes your blood pressure, height, weight, and asks what you are there for(for my vaj!) Is it your first time? See number 5. If not, see number 6.

5. You'll meet with the doctor, in her office, before the exam. There will be a quiet assistant there, taking notes on a laptop. I wasn't weirded out by this at all, even though I felt like I might be somewhere else(question mark). Here were my initial thoughts on the doctor: super easy to talk to, compassionate, listens to your questions and answers thoughtfully, concerned about the patient's health and background. I found her to be really personable, which I was nervous about. I didn`t feel awkward discussing my medical history or anything related to my life that she asked about.

6. The exam. *dun dun duuuuun!* Honestly this was the most ""awesome"" pap smear\/pelvis exam\/medical breast feel up I've ever had. That is saying a lot because I loved my last doctor so much. The exam room was comfortable, not too cold. You get the standard gown(work it, honey!) that you leave open in the front with a lovely paper drape for your nether regions. She starts with a breast exam and moves onto a tummy and upper pelvic exam. All very gentle and she talks to you during the exam so you aren't looking around aimlessly while someone touches you. Then she will get your legs up in the stirrups(oh joy) and she does the pap smear(and whatever else you need done down there). It is all very quick and painless(at least for me). I was honestly surprised how smooth it all went.

7. This is where you part ways and put your clothes back on(no walk of shame necessary). I did end up having to pay a $20 copay for a specialist because we discussed some things other than ""standard"" wellness exam discussion, but it was no big deal. Just know that if you mention anything out of the ordinary, you will be charged a copay. I`m happy to hand over a copay for such an awesome doctor.

If you need someone ""under the hood"", so to speak, I highly recommend Dr. Moss.",1.0
Got the wanted family platter. Rice and salad was ok. But the kabobs are disgusting. Meat was rare and overseasoned  with some red spice.  Beef kabobs were inedible. Chicken kabob was gross. Ground beef was weird  and red inside. Never go back. The cook needs to be fired! Plus cross contamination of raw meat.,1.0
"My friend had guest passes and invited me to come use their kid pool with my son , when we were checking in one of the employees was giving me a hard time about letting me in , he thought I had already been there before so he said I had to wait 60 days or so to return. He than took me back to his office and asked what my reason for not being enrolled at their gym was , I simply said because their membership was a little too much for me at the time , he chuckled and acted like an ass after that , he asked what my fitness goals were and I said I work out at home , he said ""oh so you don't have fitness goals"" , and he said ""I was going to extend an offer for a 10 guest pass but it looks like we aren't a fit for you"". I wouldn't want a membership with these people , you don't treat a guest that is there for the first time like that , so that's the reason I rate it a 1 star , the guest should always be treated with respect.",1.0

"**Review on the Yelp Elite Experience -- Screening of The Founder**

Woot, I was so thrilled to be one of the 15 Toronto Yelp Elites to have made it into the Elite event and got tickets for 2 to see The Founder movie 2 days before its official premier :D

Upon reading the movie ticket, it says that the screening is intentionally overbooked and the tickets are distributed on a first come first serve basis. As a result, my plus one and I decided to play it save and we came over to the theater right after we finished work. We arrived at around 6pm and there was already a line waiting for the tickets. Fortunately we were fairly early that we were able to beat the crowd and got a good seat in the middle of the auditorium. However, my friend who also got the tickets arrived just before the movie was able to start and he got turned away because the theater was full. 

The theater is a lot smaller than other Cineplex theaters that I've been to, such as the one at the Fairview Mall. However, since the threatre is location near the Financial District, there is a Lounge that you don't see very often at other Cineplex theaters. In the lounge they serve drinks, desserts, and even dinners. I'm not sure about the prices, but I'd expect everything to be pricier, similar to how the concession stand is, since it is located at the theater. The auditorium is a lot smaller than the ones that I'm used to as well, but the seats and the picture quality are still ok, so no complains here. 

It seems that the screening was intended to generate buzz for the movie and also for audience testing, since we were asked how the movie went as we were leaving the auditorium. Also, they encouraged us to share our experience on social media. Other than Yelp Elites, there were also many people who were invited to the screening, including bloggers, movie critics, and media persons.

Overall I had a great experience at the screening of The Founder, and the movie about the founding story of McDonald's exceeded my exception. The only thing that set this experience apart from a 5 star review is due to the fact that it's overbooked that many were turned away at the door. I understand why they did that but it was still unfortunate that my friend couldn't come in and they didn't provide with him a free ticket to another movie, so he had to pay to see another movie instead.",1.0
"I just have to start off by mentioning the delightful presentation of the Thai Iced Tea-- the shaved ice snowball knocked it out of the park, and the tiny flag brought it home.

The tiny staff was slightly overwhelmed by our hefty group of 20-- but nonetheless were super sweet, gracious, and accommodating. There were other guests dining, and there were literally two servers and one cook.

I had the amazing cashew chicken, which was terrific, but I overheard that the real dish to order was the catfish, which was ordered by several from our party.

It should be noted that I'm not big on spicy food. That said, myself and others ordered their meals ""mild"" heat, but definitely felt the burn. If you are expecting a 2 out of 10 on the spicy scale, you will actually be getting more of a 6 or 7. Nevertheless, this was nothing my white rice did not temper, and I ate every last bite.

I would highly recommend Chuchote for a casual meal out, but definitely not for a group of larger than four.",1.0
"I love this place.  I think I came one of the first weekends they were open.  I've been back once or twice more.  Basically, whenever I'm in Belmont visiting my parents, I find an excuse to go.

"I've used Dogtopia a couple of times and my latest experience ended up with my dog having 10+ staples and an unsatisfactory explanation and lack of accountability on Dogtopia's part.

I received a calling notifying me that my pooch was attacked by another dog and is being taken to the vet to be cared for. I get that dogs sometimes get in tussles and that's a risk you have to accept when boarding your pet with other dogs. I did not expect my dog to be severely injured all over his body tought. From the injuries the fight would have had to went on for a while which leads me to believe there was no supervision around. They took him to the vet and paid for the bills (which is to be expected) but at the end of the day, I was out $400 with a severely injured dog and no assurance that Dogtopia had the proper mitigation in place to address such obvious situations (i.e. supervised play time). I was denied information about the situation such as the breed that attacked my dog so now I don't know what to expect if he's now dislikes a certain breed after the situation. 

That staff is nice for the most part, but I've lost all confidence in their ability to take care of my pet. I highly suggest looking elsewhere.",1.0

"Discovered another something else amazing about Costco today. My car battery died in the parking lot. I called AAA, but it was going to take them over an hour to get there. We went into the tire center to see if they could replace a battery. They do sell batteries, but they don't install them. They will give you a battery with jumper cables to jump your car for free though! We were able to jump the car and drive it somewhere to get a new battery. Costco never ceases to impress me!",1.0

Didn't used before their alteration service. Till now. Few days ago received a new working coat from internet order that was a little bit too long. They custom tailored it for me on the spot, even before the  laundromat finished the program. The coat fitted me perfectly. Well, friendly and quality service, provided in a safe place.",1.0
"Stopped into this location with a friend for a quick lunch, this week. We both ordered an ODB and found it to be fucking fantastic.

The textures are exactly right without being soggy or greasy in any direction. It was just a great casual meal for a reasonable price.

I'm only knocking a star because the seating in this tiny location isn't my favorite. I hate sitting on backless, metal bar stools and would rather just stand -- which can be precarious while shoveling food into your face. Seating quirks aside, their food is delicious.",1.0
"All of my recent reviews talk about my weird food allergies.  Prior to Harvest Market existing I drove to Chicago for a lot of my shopping to go to Whole Foods and Trader Joe's.  Strawberry Fields and the Urbana Co-op either didn't have what I needed or was so expensive that I didn't bother.  

Otherwise I would have to go to County Market, Meijer, and Schnucks to try and get all of my food.  It's nice to be able to get it all in one store.  I've heard complaints that Harvest Market is too expensive but here's some comparisons:

1. Free range eggs: Local Illinois at Harvest Market start at $2.99 a dozen.  ""Local"" St. Louis eggs at Meijer and Schnucks start at $3.29.

2. Grind your own peanut butter and almond butter.  No other grocery stores other than the Co-Op have this.  It's way cheaper at Harvest.

3. All the bulk food is cheaper than anywhere else.

4. Canned tuna.  I have to have unsalted canned tuna and this place has it and the most reasonable prices.

5. Alcohol free extracts.  Finally I can have flavored food without anaphylactic shock from the alcohol at a good price!

6.  Flowers.  Seriously these flowers and plants are gorgeous.

7. Fish.  They have the most variety of wild caught fish without the added salt and preservation.

My only request is to lower the GT's kombucha prices.  Way cheaper in Chicago and Schnucks.",1.0

"Since coming back to this restaurant a few months ago, we have been regulars on the weekends for breakfast but I think that our most recent experience here will be our last.  

We had breakfast there this past Saturday.  I ordered the Bacon and Egg sandwich with turkey bacon, tomato and lettuce.  I asked for the egg to be cooked over medium.  It came to the table fried (omelette style).  I didn't bother to complain because the food took so long to come out that we were going to be late for another appointment.  I was charged an extra $1 for the turkey bacon which didn't entirely surprise me but it would have been nice to have been told in advance that this would be the case.  

My bf's daughter ordered the Chicken avocado sandwiche and asked for onion rings instead of fries (like she has every other time she ordered this dish).  The waitress never told us that this substitution would cost us $2,99!  We have never been charged this before and I only noticed this after paying the bill so I asked the waitress (who appeared to be relatively new) what this charge was for.  She went to speak to someone in the kitchen and came to explain that it was for the onion rings.  She went on to explain that if we had ordered a burger and wanted to substitute onion rings for the fries, there would not be an extra charge but since we ordered a sandwich and wanted to have the same substitution, we had to pay an extra $3!  This is ridiculously arbitrary and I mentioned that to her as well as the fact that it would have been nice to have been told that in advance.  Instead of apologizing or offering to refund me the extra charge, she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""sorry, I'm new here"".  

I guess that this restaurant doesn't appreciate regular customers so I will not be bothering them anymore with my business.  There are many places in the surrounding area that offer good value breakfasts that I can visit instead (such as Scrumptious (at Bayview and Elgin Mills area)).  They don't charge extra for turkey bacon and the portions are just as generous and the prices are comparable.",1.0

"Went on a Thursday night with my fiance to avoid the weekend crowds and figured we could enjoy some Cajun\/Creole food and maybe some canned Jazz\/Blues music. Nope. Broken glass in the parking lot and then...

Food:
There were two menu items with Cajun names - NOLA shrimp and Mardis Gras chicken wings. The shrimp was in some kind of BBQ sauce and the chicken wings came in various sauces. There was NOTHING Cajun\/Creole on the menu. We had shrimp scampi with southern green beans, fried okra and two kinds of Mardi Gras wings. The shrimp scampi was six shrimp with some store bought seasoning served on buttered spaghetti (nasty), the green beens were canned (nasty), the okra was good and so were the wings.

Staff:
Our waiter was friendly but utterly clueless on the menu. We asked him what came with their shrimp basket (maybe a salad, hush puppies, fries...) and he had no idea. He checked and returned to say fries.

Drinks:
Perhaps we can salvage this with some good drinks? Nope. Their drink specials ($5) were a list of alcohols. Like vodka, gin, crown, st. germane... How the heck do you order a drink? I asked our waiter for a vodka martini. He asked ""what's in a martini?"" I explained. Bartender sends him back to see if I want dry or sweet vermouth. ""Dry please"" I say. My ""martini"" arrives w\/o olives (or anything) and is a 50\/50 mix of vermouth and vodka. My fiance ordered a crown and ginger ale. She did not fare much better than me.

Music:
Nope, no Jazz or Blues on the speakers.

Atmosphere:
You're kidding right? It looked like a good setup for a live band though. You'll pay an extra cover charge ($7\/pp) for that. Since we didn't go on a live night we enjoyed the stares from other diners and a group playing pool across the restaurant. We were seated away from everyone else. When we left I noticed a couple at another table glaring at us. I'd like to point out that we didn't complain to our waiter (or anyone else) and we were not loud or anything else you might consider bad behavior. Our crime? We're white. The only white folk in the place that night. We grew up around NYC and love all different cultures. Heck, we grew up with them. First time I ever felt racism - from some of the other patrons, not the staff.

Bottom Line: If you go, go for the live music and eat\/drink before you go. Nope, not a beer list either.",1.0
"My boyfriend and I were looking for breakfast during our first morning and Vegas and spotted this place in the Linq Promenade. As soon as I saw it was Mexican breakfast, I was immediately sold. 

Because it was our first morning and Vegas is a marathon not a sprint, we decided to each have a cocktail and split breakfast. I ordered their Michelada which was a perfect combination of spicy, salty, bubbly goodness and my boyfriend tried his first Tequila Sunrise. For breakfast we went with one of my favorites, chiliquiles. Now my gauge for a good order of chiliquiles is are the chips still crispy, is the salsa tangy and warm, and is the egg soft? Sure my standards are specific but I'm a chiliquiles enthusiast, k? Not only were all of my standards achieved, this breakfast ended up being a perfect beginning to our first day and set the bar pretty high for food for the rest of the trip.

"This was the day when the missus and I had pretty much had it with cooking. So, on a whim, we decided to try out this new Greek restaurant that I'd been nagging her about since I noticed that the renovation wrap had come down from the windows.

What a great idea! I truly amaze myself sometimes, I do.

We started off by sharing an order of saganaki, choosing the Kefalograviera over the Halloumi. It was wonderful, and I especially appreciated that the dish was not accompanied by a bevy of frantic wait-staff yelling Opa! Opa! then setting my food ablaze. Simplicity rules; and this dish needed no greek gyrations or Hellenic handstands to enhance the dish. This delicious fried melty cheese appetizer instead whispered to me that we were in good hands. Authentic hands. Hands from the Old Country that know that quality comes from the ingredients and preparation.

For the main, we ordered a bottle of Retsina, some chicken brochettes for the missus, and a plate of married sardines for myself. Honestly, I thought that ""married sardines"" was a typo and that they meant ""marinated sardines"" but no; these little sardines were sandwiched together then cooked with simple, tasty spices and served alongside grilled zucchini and a little bowl of mashed chickpeas (or something). The plate (see the photo I uploaded) reminded me of the fresh-from-the-sea sardines that I had had that one time in Paros so I was sublimely happy. 
The Missus's brochettes were also delicious. She let me have a tiny nibble and no more. You know things are good when the missus doesn't share!

I should also mention that I learned something that night too. I've been a fan of Retsina since the *cough-cough* twentieth century and I was delighted when the waitress suggested that I try the wine with a squirt of Pepsi. Seriously. I had never heard that Retsina could be drunk this way and the expression on my face showed it. However, being adventurous I took her up on it and tried it.  OPA!! adding Pepsi to Retsina wine turns it into a kind of Vermouthy aperitif! Amazeballs!! Best discovery ever!!

Desert? I wasn't hungry, but I knew that I wasn't ready to stop eating. I asked for the Loukoumades and was not disappointed. These light and fluffy deep-fried balls of happiness (think donut batter) were served piping hot and covered with a lovely sheen of greek honey. What a perfect way to end a meal.

My only negative comment on the evening would have to be about the chairs. They're not super comfy, but then again I completely stopped thinking about them the moment the food arrived.

"Ok so I've waited awhile to post a review.  I tell ya what, buying a car in this city is not the easiest thing to do.  I knew the reviews weren't great to start with but we found a vehicle we wanted and that had a good price so we went ahead and bought it.
The process went smoothly enough.  We had had an outstanding experience at Infinity of Scottsdale (their 'sister') the year before but this is definitely your typical lower end and unimpressive dealership so be prepared to be haggled to death.  They have an absurd dealer fee which includes a bunch of hogwash about window tinting and what not.  Oh and by the way we were told this was 'standard' but got several different prices for it from several different people so I know it's a load of you know what.  They also talked us into a warranty which upon returning home and doing the math and seeing what it actually covered we decided we wanted to remove it.  We immediately called and even though they hadn't processed the papers my husband had to drive all the way back to their office to re-sign all the papers with the warranty off  what a waste of time!
The clincher really was when we realized that the driver door wasn't closing properly.  So we immediately called them and they said to bring it in since it still has the factory warranty.  2 different people said they'd fix it since we had just purchased the vehicle.  So we brought it in and they proceeded to tell us it wasn't covered.  Um, this is a car that is 1 year old and still under the factory warranty so how is this not covered?  We have tried to follow up with the customer service manager and she won't return our calls.
I think the thing that really ticks me is before we found this particular vehicle we had called the dealer inquiring about purchasing or leasing a new vehicle.  They kept calling us, kept coming up with better deals and numbers.  Then we happened upon this 1 year old vehicle that was better for our budget.  And the minute there is a problem we can't get ONE person to help us out.  It just goes to show that they truly do not care about the customer, just about making a sale.  As much as we love our car, we won't be loyal customers to this dealership.",1.0
"The biggest draw for me here is that it's in the same lot as the Lindt Outlet. Place is clean (even the washroom) with roomy tables and booths. Not too much in the way of decor. 

We Ordered:
- Special Pho with rare beef, beef ball, beef tendon, beef tripe and beef brisket; it was heavy on the sesame oil not too much depth of flavor.
- Thai Shrimp salad with (iceburg) lettuce, tomato, onion, and green and red bell pepper. This was very light not heavy enough for a main salad but would make a good side salad for two people.
- Lemonade soda was potent; I had to let the ice melt a bit to tone it down. If you like sweet and sour drinks, this one is for you.

We like staying here.  The location is great and there's a lot to see and do.  The lodge is non-smoking which is rare but fabulous.  We usually like to spend at least an evening in the club when we're staying in the RV park.  We did that this time.  I can't say the bartenders are friendly because they aren't really welcoming.

Some Elk lodges are so friendly towards traveling members and others aren't. We've visited a lot of them and they're all different.   However, like I said ... the RV park here is really great.  We're glad they have the park for us to use.  The RV park would be a 5 star by itself considering it's an Elks lodge.",1.0
"So this is the thing with this place: i would give 4 stars for the food but the place itself was just okay. 
Let's start with the food then: we got some shrimp, catfish, ribs and brisket. Food was good. I especially enjoyed the brisket and the shrimp. The ribs were okay but I wouldn't order that next time.
For people who lived in Los Angeles, this is similar to the boiling crab except with some bbq as well. 
The thing that was not cool: that siren\/loud blasting thingy that goes off for...birthdays that would be my guess? First time was okay but after the 3rd time it definitely ruined my dining experience.

"I'm not quite sure where to begin. I've been a customer for 10 years and have warranties on two properties. I was extremely pleased with the service I received from one guard up until about two years ago. Suddenly all of the processes seem to change and just about any repair required ""approval"" which always seems to take it completely unreasonable amount of time, at one point it took entire week to receive approval for a necessary repair on our AC only to have the contractor show up with the wrong part. This year the air-conditioning at our residence has gone out five separate times and we have had repeated issues with the unit at our rental property. I truly believe that one guard only employs contractors willing to lie and slap a Band-Aid on the problem in an effort to avoid meeting their obligation to replace a unit that any honest contractor would replace. I had one contractor suggest that my air handler be replaced and funny enough before too long he was no longer working as a contractor for one guard. I have a small infant at home and as a result of repeated repairs this summer have spent 8 nights in a hotel for which one guard reimburses a paltry $65 a night. This has created an extreme amount of stress for me as a full-time working mom, as each time I've has to put my life on hold and pack all of the many things an infant requires in a sweltering hot 90 degree home. I've had to take time off work to move my family back and forth. This past weekend my air conditioning went out again at 10 PM on a Friday and because of a family event being hosted at my home the following day I decided not to call oneguard but instead call an emergency HVAC company.  The tech diagnosed a Freon leak and had to refill 5 lbs of refrigerant to the tune of nearly 1000 dollars. I told the technician that I had just had Freon filled a couple of months ago as well as the prior year and he explained to me that the cause of the repeated refills was a refrigerant leak and that air conditioning units in general should not require Freon to be refilled. He explained that the only remedy for our unit was to replace the unit entirely. I believe that the contractors employed by one guard were aware of the leak and the need to  replace the unit and one guard has repeatedly ignored the need for the unit to be replaced. I'm not sure what my next steps are, I'm considering contacting the AZ Attorney General regarding their fraudulent business practices as I am confident they terminate the contract of any honest repair person acting in the best interest of the consumer.

         Review on fountain view suite
1. This hotel is not a casino so it has no entertainment. 
2. This hotel does not have a self parking only valet parking at a charge. So you either have to park at bellagio or aria and walk over.  Which if you forget something in your car turns into a mission. 
3. There is nothing to do but sit while waiting for your room to become available.  (Ours wasn't ready till almost 5 pm.)
4. The pool is small and doesn't seem very kid friendly.  Everyone is quiet and to themselves. I think for a resort their pool could be much bigger.. it's about the same size as an apartment pool.. which is meant to serve all 50+ floors. Not very impressed. 

The good things

1. Our fountain view suite had a bedroom and livingroom.  Door to room can be closed for privacy from guests. 
2. Had a table for 4 people,  full fridge,  microwave, washer and dryer,  sink,  cook top.  But u had to order pots pans or plates from house keeping.
3.Has one full bath that includes 2 sinks,  stand shower,  separate tub, toilet small bathroom closet and a main frosted glass door for privacy. Has a 2nd bathroom by suite entrance fur guests.  Only toilet and sink. 
4. Livingroom and bedroom had flat screen tvs... livingroom couch turns into a bed. windows have black out shades and are controlled from panels on the wall. 

 Over all Very nice hotel over all but parking cam become a problem And hassle.

"This is a nice place to stop by for some Chinese noodle soups. At my first visit, I was kind of taken aback by how heavy the soup is. It's super filling and pretty heavy with oil, but packed with flavor. After getting used to it after the second or third time coming here, I think I learned to appreciate the flavors. Definitely recommend the beef brisket noodle soup. The establishment has made the menus more English-friendly, which I appreciate. You used to have to bring someone who could read and order in Chinese. Definitely a spot to stop by for your savory noodle cravings.",1.0
"My colleagues love this place for their soups and sandwiches - just a few steps away from our office and always offering good variety at reasonable prices. This is a take-out spot that gets quite the lineup every weekday at lunchtime, but orders move quickly. There's some seating nearby in the food court-like setup, but if your office is just steps away I advise taking your meal to go. The kitchen is quite open concept and their setup is simple - definitely gives you a homestyle kitchen serving feel. 

So far, I've only tried their soups - definitely a homemade taste, nothing super special but their guarantee of no oil, no cream, no MSG...a bunch of other no's...makes for it to be a healthy option suitable to many diets. A colleague also introduced me to getting a mix of soups - which worked surprisingly well to diversify the flavours and give a unique experience. The middle eastern flavour may not be for all, but a hearty bowl of soup for lunch leads me to think of this spot immediately. I can't say I ever crave their food, but I can see why many return time after time.",1.0

This place is awesome!!! I've never been here before and when we showed up it was packed. No where to park and the wait was an hour to an hour and a half. So long story short we tried sitting in the bar and there was some miscommunication about where we were sitting. Meagan came and totally took care of us. I was shocked at her resolution for the problem. We were seated right away. I was like.... what!!!  She didn't have to do that. The service was great. The meal was so delicious. I just can't get over their level of customer service. I can't wait to come back and visit and eat here with my husband (we are from Dan Diego).  Oh by the way our server was Kaylene. She was so sweet and adorable. She played along with us and was funny. Loved her!! Thanks for making my last night with my girlfriend a memorable one!,1.0

"UPDATE The company that came out and pretended to be Zerorez was NOT !!  The owner of the real Zerorez contacted me after he saw this post and assured me that he did not even have a service Tech named Daniel, he also is sending me a $100 certificate to use the real ZEROREZ the next time I need my carpet cleaned!!  So please disregard the post below which now I know the company that came out was a scam company and NOT ZEROREZ!! 

 Scheduled Zerorez to clean carpet in 3 tiny rooms 10 X 12 (carpet only 3 years old and kept clean vacuumed regularly  and I only have carpet in three rooms) on  their 4 rooms for $59 special.

"Black Bear Japanese Fusion was under the radar for me until I saw it on social media. I saw the soft shelled crab burger on social media a couple of times and I knew I had to try it. The fiance and I came here on a wednesday evening around 6pm. They asked if we made any reservations....we did not D: Luckily it was not busy yet so we were lucky we were able to get a table. It started getting busy at around 6:30. 
 
My friends had recommended the purple sweet potato milkshake and the strawberry hill drink to try. 
 
I loovvvvedddd the purple sweet potato milkshake!!! It had the right amount of creaminess and sweet potato flavour, and was also not too sweet, just the way I like it! The strawberry hill is a yakult\/soda drink, lightly fizzed and with a delicious strawberry tart flavour. I really recommend those two drinks. Only problem is I wish the strawberry hill drink was in a bigger glass LOL other than that, it was SOOOOO good. 
 
Our meal started with the K-pop chicken with the gochujang spicy sauce. I loved the batter on the chicken!! Hot and crispy, the chicken was perfectly fried on the outside but still very juicy on the inside.
 
For the main course we each ordered one item. The soft shell crab (obviouslyyyy) and the udon carbonara.
 
The udon carbonara was creamy with earthy and smoky flavours from the mushroom and bits of bacon which were very nice. However, it was a bit too saucy. The fiance wasn't too fond of that but to be honest I don't mind at all cause I love a lot of sauce on my noodles.
 
But seriously though......the soft shell crab burger was hands down my favourite!! I loved that they put avocado in there. AVOCADO ON ANYTHING IS AMAZING THOUGH. The soft shell crab was fried to perfection, a crunchy edible shell on the outside and steaming hot crab meat on the inside. It was delicious with the spicy mayo and cheese and all pressed together by two pieces of fluffy bun. This is a dish that I would definitely come back for very soon!",1.0
"Planning my wedding in a few months basically took the life out of me and the venue was the last thing to come together. Thankfully Tunde made the whole process a lot easier. It got to the point where I was trying to scramble together something semi-decent at the last minute. My expectations may have started out low, but as I got more and more input I realized I might be in somewhat of a pickle because what I wanted was either going to cost me way too much or it was too late to get it.

Thankfully Maple Banquet Hall was available and Tunde really sold me on the idea. I came in when it was decorated it was lovely. It looks like your typical banquet hall, which was something I initially didn't want but I realized would provide us with the comfort and ease of a celebration for a winter reception. Tunde gave me the flexibility of letting her know napkin colours and last-minute details a week before the actual wedding. We sat down earlier and mapped out what I would possibly want and wrote it all out. She left clear instructions for the people who were setting up since she wouldn't be there that day and wanted to have everything go as planned. 

Our wedding was a smaller affair and so we booked the Princess Hall but added seats to the max capacity. It was an intimate affair and wonderfully cozy. The decor was absolutely stunning and Tunde did an excellent job working it out with me and my budget. Everything was exactly as we had discussed. I know the washrooms got a lot of feedback on yelp but I found them fine (maybe they renovated?). My one issue was that because we had the smaller hall and there were events happening on either side of us, my husband and I didn't really have a bridal suite. Instead we were given the office which had windows on either side that people could see into, which made outfit changes extremely difficult.",1.0

For breakfast buffet, at the section where omelet is cooked before you, be sure you specify clearly how you want it cooked, otherwise it can be cooked hard.   In whole, the meals and selections are very good.   We go there often and have always been greeted and served by friendly and courteous staff.

First, we shared the deer tartare which... I really have no word for it. It just melted in the mouth, the deer as well as the bread. Then, we shared the pork ribs and shoulder and the duck breast.

I'm pretty young and felt like at other places I was judged for being such a young person looking to get in the gaming biz, so that's another huge plus for CEG. I felt like I learned so much in such a short time and that I was learning from people who really knew what they were doing.

The training itself was by no means easy, either. In order to learn, I had to really commit to going to classes and apply myself. I honestly didn't pick things up that easily, but Alex and his teachers were very upfront to me when I was dealing incorrectly and they would provide constructive criticism on what exactly to do, how to fix my techniques, etc. On top of training, this school will help you get a job. So they don't just train you, they prep you, they help you apply and then they prepare you for the interviews! I remember being nervous for my auditions, but I felt extremely prepared otherwise.",1.0
"A few things I learned from my recent visit: 1) Don't bother being early. I waited 50 minutes.  2) The paperwork warns you against ""side effects and contradictions"" -- the medical term they needed to use was ""contraindications."" This does not matter to your certification, but it does matter to their level of professionalism. Obviously, no lawyer looked at the paperwork?  3) If you are using cash to pay for the doctor's visit ($110-125) that's okay. BUT, you CANNOT pay cash for the State fee ($75-150). You will need to bring a MC or Visa. Otherwise, the NMD (Dr.) on staff was kind and efficient.",1.0
"Be careful before you sign a lease AND be sure you have all of your roommates that you want to live with ready to sign when you do. If not, this place will randomly assign you a roommate without any advance notification or communication.

My suggestion is to seek another place to live...unless you enjoy the thrill of living with a complete stranger.",1.0

"This was a last minute decision after a long night returning from a soccer match in Tempe\/Scottsdale. While driving home last at night my options were minimal, but after deciding what Mexican spot to for a drive-thru experience Ramiro's came up right away! I can honestly say it has been a minute since I have made a visit. For some reason menudo just sounded right! The location is kind of hidden north of Bell Road, so don't drive over 50 mph or guarantee you will miss it! I like the fact that this location has menudo all day and night, 7 days a week. Who else does? Anyhow I was once again satisfied with my tasteful red menudo complimented with corn tortillas, cilantro, chopped onions and limes to mix to my soupy dream!",1.0
"Was interested in checking this place out. The pictures on yelp all looked great and it was well hyped on the Nextdoor website by people in the area. Went right at noon. Found the experience very ordinary. Decided to order a Double Cheese Boyger, chilli cheese fries, and a vanilla shake. Was going to order separately but the kid working the counter tried to enter it as a combo and had to get assistance to ring me up. The price was the same as if I ordered separately so not sure why he didn't want to go that route.

Then the wait began. Took about 15 mins to receive my food even though there were only a couple of tables that were there before me and not eating. I was not in a rush so it wasn't a huge deal.

The food itself was kinda blah. The chili on the chili cheese fries was very bland. So much so I actually had to add some ketchup to give it some flavor. Ketchup on chili cheese fries! Also the real ice cream milk shake was soupy and tasted very watered down. The highlight of the meal was the boyger which was decent. I would liken it to a Fatburger taste wise but more moist (which is the reason I don't go to Fatburger because I find their burgers dry). I ordered it with all the toppings. Was it enough to make me want to come back? Not really. I mean for a total of $13.64, I felt a double double animal style, animal fries, and shake from In N Out would have been much tastier and probably cheaper and faster.

NOTE: if you are like me and don't like burgers that are really think and obscure the taste of condiments and bun, go with a single. By the time I got to the middle of the double boyger, all I could really taste was meat (thankfully it was tasty). I am not sure how the monster boyger or double monster compare but pretty sure if I do go back, I would just order a single.",1.0

"Great ambiance, love the cocktail menu. Dinner menu somewhat limited, but I was very happy with my selection (pork loin). They seemed to have a lot of flexibility for gluten-free options, which was a plus for my group (with 2 gluten allergies in the crew). My friend who got the burger said it was good but not great. One weird thing--we were there for a birthday, and when we informed our server of that, they brought out an empty plate with a candle on it. It was a bit awkward, I'd rather they just say ""actually we don't do anything for birthdays, but we hope you enjoy dinner"".",1.0
"I decided to try Riya's Nails specifically because I wanted to get acrylic nails for an upcoming vacation. I used their website to schedule my appointment, since I knew from previous reviews that I couldn't walk in. I scheduled myself for a full set + pedicure with a nail technician named Kong. 
When I arrived I found that the salon was clean and trendy. I loved the damask walls. Kong was ready for me when I arrived and we got started on my pedicure. The best thing about my experience at Riya's Nails was working with Kong. He was so friendly and made easy conversation with me throughout my pedicure and acrylic set. It actually felt like talking to a friend. The pedicure was pretty good, except I found that the hot towels were not especially hot. I should also note that Kong found me a charger for my phone when I commented that it was dying. 
I haven't had acrylic nails in years and I knew this wasn't something I was planning to keep up with. But I chose Riya's because they appear to specialize in beautiful decorative acrylic nails. I went back and forth on whether I wanted chrome nails or to try the galaxy nail & ultimately settled on the galaxy nails. There are so many more options available since the days of getting my square acrylics airbrushed in 2006! It was hard to decide what I wanted.
Kong had good attention to detail and my nails turned out beautiful. He took some time to snap chat (for me) and take modeled photos (for him) of my new acrylic set. 
However, my appointment started at 5:30pm and Kong didn't complete my transaction until after 9pm. I know this was likely due to me needing a full acrylic set, but this still seemed like an excessive amount of time in the salon. Everyone else had left the salon shortly before we were finished, leaving Kong to close up shop after quickly cashing me out. After nearly 4 hours in the salon, I was exhausted, hungry and thirsty. This is certainly not something I would want to do biweekly. I can also verify that I wasn't quite sure how much everything was going to cost in the end. The website lists prices but it's not clear what is considered an extra and how it's all going to add up. In the end my nails + pedicure + tip was around $90.  Again, not the kind of money I'm accustomed to spending on a mani\/pedi.
I would return to Riya's Nails if I wanted another full set but I probably wouldn't go out of my way to schedule ahead and be there for hours if I wanted a quick mani-pedi.",1.0
"Very sad situation.  I purchased  new pair of New Balance running shoes to replace an older pair.  I have only had my new pair for a few months and have hardly used them.  On a trip to Las Vegas the treads peeled off the bottom of the left shoe.  Not having another shoe for my trip, I headed to the New Balance store to replace my defective shoe.

After trying on shoes to replace the defective one, I found out they would not credit me or replace the shoe because I didn't purchase it in their store.  The store is privately owned and not affiliated with any other New Balance store.  But surely they could contact the corporate office since it is a defective product.  Nope.  So I am stuck with a shoe that is falling apart while I am on a trip for 4 days.

"Wow. 

It's both sad and fascinating to see this business kill itself off over time. 

I'm not even sure happy hour specials exist here anymore. The price has sharply gone up on pitchers of domestic beer, through which they used to make a solid $5 per visit. They now make $0 per visit. 

I ate a hamburger there last time I went. I didn't die, but the price was a good $3 more expensive than comps (30% higher), and priced on par with Red Robin (which makes a significantly better hamburger) and Smashburger (same). If you're going there to meet with people, eat at one of the several dozen restaurants in the block first. 

I'm not sure what draw remains for customers. Specialty drinks? Not that I'm aware of. Cheap drinks? No. Specials? Long gone. Good service? I'm not going to fault the only employee who works there for not being able to get around to a loaded table, but it points to a management issue.

"Poseidon smiles upon the hands that bless us with the aquatic cuisine at Seafood Connection. It lives up to the hype. On a Friday afternoon, around 4:30, I waited an hour and a half before ordering, followed by 10 minutes for the food to come out. Despite the time, it was love at first bite. This is great seafood. So good, I returned 5 days later for another round. The second visit, a Wednesday at 2:15, there was practically no wait. I was in and out in 15 minutes.

The food is seasoned to perfection with lots of butter. This is Not healthy seafood, so pack your cholesterol meds. Food is served in a takeout box, whether you choose to eat in or not. At first blush, the price point is on the high side, but compared to other sit down restaurants, your Red Lobsters and such, it's right on par. You're just getting better quality and tasting seafood here.

On my most recent visit I had the Super C-Port platter. It included 2 crab clusters, 4 - 1\/2 lobster tails, 16 jumbo shrimp, 4 pieces of sausage, 2 pieces of corn on the cob, and what amounts to 2 whole potatoes. Enough to feed 3. 

They should do a better job of stating how much of everything you're getting with each meal (i.e. ""2 clusters"" .... ""16 shrimp""). The menu leaves lots of questions. As far as service, they're friendly enough. No one is bringing food to your table, so there's not much to judge by.

"One of my favorite AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants! This place has been around for years. It was one of the very first K-BBQ joints that my fam and I discovered here in Vegas.

From what I was told by one of the servers, they remodeled the entire restaurant about 3 months ago from today (1\/2\/2017). The interior became more modern and they've added some new decor. A nice upgrade from before.

Service has never been a problem here and the staff are always attentive. They will keep coming back to your table to ask if you need anything else or to see if the grill needs to be changed. However, this restaurant does get busy and they may miss your table at times when helping other customers, but no biggie.

Compared to other K-BBQ restaurants in Vegas, I prefer their All You Can Eat (AYCE). I base it off the quality, cleanliness, and selection. There are 2 different AYCE prices to choose from. You can either choose the ""Spring Mountain"" menu or the ""Vegas"" menu. There used to be a menu selection called the Nevada, but their menus have changed since they've remodeled.

The Spring Mountain one has a lil bit more items to choose from for just $4 more per person. It would be the better choice. ;] Especially if you like more meat options, seafood, and other miscellaneous food items.

My favorites from Simply Pure are the:

Chicken lettuce wraps- so fresh, flavorful and filling. If you're wanting something light and delicious this one is a winner. Tastes great in the lettuce wrap and if you dip tortilla chips in it. 

Nachos- I think it would be fun if they added some beans or maybe a couple extra veggies but its still delicious and something I come back for regardless of simplicity. 

Lasagne- HUGE portion of yummyness here! All of the flavors are on point in my opinion and it's no wonder why this one is a crowd favorite. 

The kale and cranberry salad- I never thought kale could taste so good... really. Raw kale is something that without proper pairing can be bitter and over powering. But, Chef Stacy has worked her magic into creating a beautiful array of balanced flavors with this gorgeous salad! Not to mention you get a heaping portion for the price (much like literally everything Simply pure has to offer)!

TLC fresh pressed juice is my JAM! Really need some self control so I don't drink it all in one sitting.

The Halibut was a nice large piece, lightly breaded and only slightly greasy (hey...it's F&C...gotta expect some grease!), and the Haddock was a fair size and tasted great. I wish the batter was a bit crispier, but travelling home from the restaurant may have contributed to that.
The fries were a little heavy and soggy right out of the box, but once they were on the plate they crisped up a bit. Still, fries could've been cooked a little longer because I could tell that they had potential. You get a HUGE amount of them too, so come hungry!

I was hungry for breakfast (at my usual 2pm) and was delighted to see an ""all-day burrito"" on the menu. My server was prompt, friendly and got my order in quickly after I was seated. However, while waiting...and waiting... it seemed ""a bit long for a burrito,"" I chuckled to myself, ""is it that it takes all day to get it, hence the name?!"" My chuckle was silenced though, when that burrito showed up and it was the mostly perfectly wrapped thing I've ever seen. Like a mid-day tenderbelly-bacon gift! Not only that, it tasted delicious - the other ingredients in it: scrambled eggs, American cheese, crispy hashbrowns, avocado, roasted corn, and pico de gallo. The fries were some of the best I've ever had as well. (Score points on that whipped avocado sour cream that is one of the choices of dip with the fries; you may also choose from malt aioli or spicy Russian.) The same manager who gave me the table popped back over to ask about my food and he commented out of the blue, ""yeah, we call it the 'all day burrito' since you can get it any time of day."" Is he a mind-reader too!? Haha, it's as if he known that I secretly had doubted. Well, I would wait all-day for this thing anyway, so I guess it works out either way. The rest of the menu deserves further exploration at a time TBD!

I had received contact information from a few others that had worked with our venue, and truthfully I was NOT impressed with the quality.

Every day they offer a special item at a steep discount and this day it was grilled oysters and scallop skewers. We ordered both and they were both good. The scallops were really good. We then ordered the crispy chicken skin and marinated salty squid. Crispy chicken skin is like pork rinds, salty and crisp. The squid was not what I was expecting but cold and in a heavy sauce. It was really good. We then had orders of duck with salt, chicken thigh with salt, wagyu beef, smelts, mackerel and shrimp tempura and all were excellent. We ended the meal by having a passion roll and the special ramen. Everything was so good we left full and happy",1.0
"It almost feels pointless to review In N Out on  Yelp. What can be said that hasn't already been said? And regardless of what people on Yelp say or don't say, In N Out will always be packed. In n Out should just be given 5 stars on Yelp permanently. Anyone who gives it less than 5 stars should not be allowed to review restaurants. 

But now that they are on the Strip in Las Vegas, it behooves me to add yet another 5 star review in the hopes of helping fellow tourists find the best casual food option on the Strip.

In N Out is the gold standard by which all other fast food restaurants should be measured. They value their customers and not just in a lip service type of way. Their restaurants are clean, bright, and shiny. They have a staff of smiling, hustling, efficient workers who can move long lines that would have caused a catastrophic meltdown at other restaurants. They will not compromise on the quality or freshness of their product. They only have a couple items on the menu so that they can do their thing (burgers and fries) and do it exceedingly well. Their burgers are everything that people hype them up to be and more. And ""fairly priced"" doesn't even do justice to their prices because they could DOUBLE their prices and I would still go there the same amount without batting an eye. 

Unsurprisingly, I found this location is the same as all of the other In N Outs I have been to in terms of the above qualities. Go. You will not be disappointed.",1.0
"I stayed here on a comp night this past week.  After reading some of the reviews, I'm beginning to wonder if I stayed at the same hotel as the rest of these Yelpers.

Granted I only stayed for one night, but from check in to check out was seamless and pretty simple.

I stayed in the Octavius Tower with a pool view.  It was a nice room, but I don't use my room for much more than a place to sleep.  However, it was nice.  Not gonna complain.

The gaming was pretty good to me.  I'm a roulette player... and I did ok.  Best hit was a 3 number, 50$ (15$,15$, 20$) bet.  I hit on #13 for 525.00 just before checking out.

I had an awesome breakfast at Cafe Americano... simple breakfast.  The bacon was really good.  Service was on par as well.  I will definitely eat here for my next stay.

Compliments to Anka for the excellent customer service during check in.

Aloha, DK",1.0
"Tofu in the pad Thai was rubbery and it had hardly any sprouts.  No fresh lime either.

Husband liked the sizzling beef which he liked a lot.  Although a 3 is not spicy at all for him.

Service was very good and for me that was they only good thing about our meal tonight.",1.0
They recently catered a wedding that I helped coordinate. The food was delicious and plentiful. It was delivered on time and set up beautifully. The guests loved every bite! Can't wait to work with them again!,1.0
"Lord have mercy, what a waste of a nice office.

This place is five minutes away, so I made an appointment for my two kids. They called to reschedule the first one, fine. When we DID show up for our appt, we waited almost an hour to be seen, then were in the back another 1.5 hours. Complete disorganization.

Also, Dr Jacksons info is still all over the websie but she was nowhere to be found...we saw someone else who was nice enough, but I dont even know who they are.

We did have an appt to come back for sealants, but they tried to call and reschedule it again, so I just moved to another practice.

Dr Jackson, upon googling her after this experience, has multiple arrests and has had her dental license revoked for now...so Im not sure while she is still on the practice's webpage. More info here: http:\/\/www.ncdentalboard.org\/pdf\/Jackson,%20Brandi%20-%20Summary%20Suspension%20-%201-4-17.pdf

Very yummy. Like how you can pick the meat veggies and sauces. Shrimp was a little fishy tasting though. Will be back,1.0
"Not impressed at all with the Gates of Hell haunted house. It's a cool idea that they can push you and shock you and all that but it wasn't scary at all. We were all very excited since it was most of our first times. Unfortunately, we were pretty let down. We didn't try the other two houses but we heard the Gates of Hell was the best so we didn't even bother. The only good thing is that we went on a Friday night and the line was only about 15 minutes. We preferred the Asylum haunted house at Meadows Mall. They can't touch you or anything, but it is just a better house all around in my opinion.",1.0
One of our favorites.  Great pizza and fresh salads.  Stopped by on a cool evening so we ate inside.  Had one of the new white pizza's and a fresh salad.  Very good.  Just wish it wasn't so noisy inside.,1.0
"I've gotten their bread consistently which is one of the best in Madison. 

Their brunch lentil salad was very sad. But their French toast looked great. 

Their coffee is a little too sour and acidic for my liking. 

I've never had their pastries but those look amazing. 

I like the setup and d√©cor. I like to watch them making bread and I'm interested in what workshops will come about. 

Their service is very good. I like to go in the middle of the day on a weekday so it's not busy. Obviously that's not easy for most people but if you can do it, I'd recommend it!",1.0
"I was looking for a place near by and found this on yelp.  Immediately drawn to this one because of the name, ratings and convenience of how close it was to the strip.

So I didn't know exactly where to park as this was my first time coming to Bally's outdoor mall so I ended up just valeting but I did see a self park option but again only at Bally's hotel.  I'm not sure if that is the only option for parking or if there is a different location that wasn't visible but make sure to drive around or look it up if you don't want to park at Bally's.

When looking for this particular store front look for Wahlburgers then go down the isle in front of it and it should be 3 stores down on the left side with a sign. 

Once you walk in it is very small, there is only 2 stations one on each side a tv in the center of the wall and then some clear boxes with nail color and design options on each side.  The lady who helped me was so sweet and very helpful to making my decision. Her name is Kita and she moved here two months ago from Orange county to help open this location. She works effectively and efficiently and pays attention to detail. Almost a perfectionist if you will but in a calm manner. Absolutely loved the way she did my nails from start to finish. 

F.Y.I. Just so you are aware this is in a container shopping area which are all small spaces that do not have water supply or ventilation implemented to these units\/stores. So without water NO MANICURES and PEDICURES are possible and with NO proper ventilation ACRYLICS are there for not possible as well. This for me was not the greatest thing to learn last minute as I had no nail length and a manicure was much needed. #justsaying

I had wished someone had put a tip on yelp or they relayed that vital info over phone when called to make an appointment which by the way is walk in only. Nonetheless I loved everything else and would definitely come here again for the great designs and work ethic on the nails but I will have to go get my acrylics done else where before I come.  It seems a bit of a hassle but I guarantee you if you are a picky or a perfectionist...coming here for a disign and or color is worth the time and money for sure!",1.0
"I am actually shocked I have never written a review since I have been coming here for 15+ years. I wish I could give more than 5 stars! 
 
There is nothing I don't love here.  From the amazing lunch bento boxes that are very decently priced to the sushi and teppenyaki tables.  Sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go!  All the guys back there are awesome and fun to watch.  Brandon is the best! 
Group nights you have to do the teppenyaki tables! Entertaining and good food.  I have had many birthday celebrations growing up at those teppenyaki tables. 
I am such a creature of habit here but I can't help it - I love it!!  My go to's: Tako Salad (the spicy ponzu is heaven in a liquid - I want the recipe!), house salad (also obsessed with this dressing - best in town) & Crazy Roll (Shrimp Tempura and Spicy Tuna - you cant go wrong) get it with a side of the spicy ponzu and its a party in your mouth! My dad always gets the salmon kama and its so delicate and perfectly cooked.  Something new to the menu that I now love is the crispy rice with spicy tuna.  I could go on and on.  Just come try for yourself.",1.0
"Best quick, easy, down home restaurant in Scottsdale. It makes me feel like I'm right back in North Dakota. 4 stars because the food is very basic even though the menu is insanely huge and also because they don't accept credit cards.",1.0
"Busy, busy Sheetz! I secretly love eating here sometimes, especially if I want a sandwich for the road. This Sheetz is open 24\/7. It's especially comforting to know that if I get hungry at 2am, I can drive up the road and get one of their many items on their extensive menu, including their late night menu! 

I love the fried appetizers, especially cheese filled anything. I usually get a create your own veggie sandwich with lettuce, tomato, guacamole, onion, cucumber, olives and italian dressing on a multigrain sandwich bun. They also have recipe sandwiches which look good as well! I don't care for their pizza, as it gives me a stomach ache (no idea why), but everything else I have tried here has been solid. This location usually makes food better than some other locations close by. People have caught wind of that fact though, and can be very busy. You might be waiting a while, especially at lunchtime.",1.0
"Why is there a service charge, most places don't charge a service charge. Their rates were not that great compared to places around them. As someone else posted the manager Tammy was so rude and got mad when I asked her a question.",1.0
"Ok so this is the first time I've written a second review on a restaurant. I really wanted this restaurant to be great tonight. I made a reservation a few days in advance for myself and hubby, 3 sons and one teenage son's girlfriend. I have tried making  his published short rib recipe before and it has come out wonderfully.. was anxious to taste it again . 
Hostess was friendly, smiled asked for a few minutes and  and then within minutes sat us...awesome. That's why there is one star. Then unfortunately Heidi our waitress came over but the only way we knew her name was from the bill at the end. No ""hello"" , no ""introduction""
No small talk. Just ""
What do you want to drink"". My husband and I immediately tried to be extra friendly to win her over since our last visit here had bad service. She slowly started to get a bit more friendlier as the night got on and we asked her opinions of the menu choices. Here were the major problems... we noticed there was a gluten free bread option so we asked if the bruschetta could be made on gluten free bread. She had no idea. The answer back from the kitchen was "" ok but it won't look pretty"". We were totally fine with that. Appetizers were brussel sprouts which were good but a little dry . GF bruschetta was good. Then we ordered. The special was sea bass and mushroom risotto and it was bland. Two kids had salmon and said it was ok. My son's prime rib was dry. I of course asked for the short ribs which I always order if on a menu and since I make his recipe at home
Had to try it again. The short ribs come with gnocchi which I said they could just keep off or substitute with mashed potatoes.  You would've thought I asked for oil to be mixed with vinegar. The answer from the kitchen was an absolute no and I am very easy going and said no problem just bring me a side of mashed potatoes which for some reason she wasn't understanding. So I slowly said ok just bring me the dish with a side of mashed potatoes.  I'm not celiac at all just sensitive . Well I was glad I had the short ribs because now I know for sure mine are way better!  I was surprised that they cut the ribs into smaller pieces from last year and some were fatty. Well we all ate and left full but never had that great experience that made us want to stay and linger with coffee and dessert. Unlike the first review I wrote, the dishes were picked up timely. Just lacking that smiling waitress, that great food experience and that kitchen that wants the local business. Sorry! Too many other great restaurants here to try. Won't visit again.",1.0
"When we started coming to Aqua-Tots the experience was fantastic. My daughter had an instructor that was phenomenal and really cared. She than left the school and the next instructor we had was amazing as well. The instructor was so great we decided to upgrade to private lessons with the instructor. Well that was clearly a bad move as for several weeks in a row the instructor did not show up leaving our child with no lesson. Now the school did compensate us for the inconvenience. We are then given a new instructor who was great until she fell into the same routine. One week, two weeks and than the final straw a third week in a row the instructor was a no show. At this point there is a clear issue with instructors showing up to work. We were informed by Alexis at the front desk that the manager would contact us regarding our concerns. Once again one day, two days well 7 days goes by no call from the manager. This location lacks communication on several different areas. Aqua Tots Peoria needs to understand nobody wants free credits, make up classes or a backpack. What we want is for instructors to show up and teach our children. We want instructors to communicate amongst each other so when a new instructor steps in my child is not having to start all over but take off from where they left off. As of today we still have not heard from the manager and that's ok as we have pulled our child from this location. If you don't want consistent instructors this is the place for you however if communication is important I would think twice about this location.",1.0
"This place was quite the surprise. I was so impressed   I can't wait to go back. I had the Yellow Curry and was amazed. It was wonderful, just the perfect amount of heat and sweet. Would not have known it was all vegetarian had I not been in a vegetarian restaurant. The dish was super amazing. Let's not forget the homemade ice cream, accompanied with fried bananas finished with a strawberry sauce.",1.0
"Holy overpriced burgers. Ok so I've paid over $20 for a just burger before in a fancier place but to grab lunch and spend $20 on a burger combo in a fast food kind of place is kinda stupid. 
Don't get me wrong, their burgers are very tasty and I will return. But I have to be really craving a burger with yummy mushrooms! 
The staff is ok, not welcoming but they do what they get paid for. 
The look of the place is hip and cute.
If you want a yummy burger and don't mind spending the extra cash then try it!",1.0
"This restaurant is FANTASTIC, my husband and I actually went two nights in a row. We discovered this place while walking through old town, and decided to stop in for a few apps and cocktails. We had the tuna tartare, truffle mushrooms, and meatballs. The food was so incredible, and the customer service was even better! Our only regret is that we didn't eat a full dinner, so we went back the next night. My husband and I are extreme foodies, and have NEVER visited a restaurant two nights back to back while on vacation. Well, we went the second night for the steak, and again were blown away! The steak melted in your mouth, and the sides were incredible. The staff really made our experience amazing, and took the time to ensure we had everything we needed and had fun while doing so!!! This dining experience is in our top 3, and gives Gordon Ramsay's restaurant, Steak, a run for its money! Well done guys!",1.0
Best wings in town and a good beer selection! Plus the live band was great...dueling pianos tonight! They were awesome!,1.0
"Have had lousy food in my lifetime but this place ranks right in the top three!

I love Greek food and while the staff was friendly the food was horific.

Tsadiki had ""no garlic"" Gyros with French fries in them can't be real. The lamb gyros and pork suvlaki meat was so over cooked, hard and tasteless that only in Mississauga could a place this lousy thrive.",1.0
"I actually really liked the Dr. I saw here.  His name was Dr. Clause.  However, the rest of my experience with this place was miserable.  The Dr. told me to schedule an apt. with the Biomechanics PT which I did.  I showed up for my apt the following Monday at 1:30 and was told that my apt. was actually on Tuesday.  I pointed out that they had written down Monday on my apt. reminder and they said, ""Sorry about that.""  So, I went ahead and rescheduled for the following Monday at 1:30.  Again, the apt was written down for me by the person who made it.  Guess what?  I showed up on the following Monday and was told that the Dr. went on vacation and someone was supposed to call me to reschedule.  According to them, I was the only person that somehow they forgot to call.  So, 2 weeks in a row I show up for an apt. that the front office scheduled only to be told it was cancelled.  I went ahead and cancelled all of my follow ups because obviously these people are extremely incompetent.  This is unfortunate because I really liked the Dr., but I think he also works somewhere else, so I will track him down there.",1.0
"Summary: this place's glasses is usually a bit lower than other store. It always has the promotion going on. Always make sure you check online for promo code.

I got my eye exam and my glasses here. The optometrist was pretty friendly.
Clearly was originally a website business. I remembered it used to give away free glasses. They open a store now. However, if you order something in the store, it still gets to ship to the store. I don't think they make anything in the store.
However, I found the sales there knows less about the website and the promotion going on than I do. Maybe they just didn't want to inform me.
I saw a pair of glasses online, and want to check out what it looked like in store. However, the store did not have it. The store did not have most glasses online.
I would recommend you just order online if you know your prescription since all the glasses have 1 year return period.",1.0
"Let me start start off this is about a policy that I feel discriminates against older patrons that  will not have us going back. It was Friday night and celebrating my wife's Birthday and were looking for a place to have drinks and listen to some Music. We arrived around 8:00 and found a spot by the back bar. Place was busy but bar service was very efficient and we settled down for the music to begin. Now we are an older demographic than
I am sure DB's marketing target's but here is the issue. Shortly before 9:00 they begin clearing tables and chairs from the dance floor. Its this next step that killed it for us.
A member of security tells me I will have to give up my seat. Why?since we are at the back bar not anywhere where we,would impede dancing. It is explained that no one is allowed to sit once the music starts. We are told we could go to the restaurant area but that defeats the purpose of our visit. It appears that DB's policy is no chairs on Friday and Saturday nights for anyone. According to the manager is its about dancing and safety. Not sure I buy either one. I do not see how stools at a back bar causes issue to either. What I can say is this if you are unwilling to make accommodations for older clients then we spend our money elsewhere. That's a non starter",1.0
"Stay away! Stay far, far away. I tried to give them a second chance after staying away the first time I was here. Food sucks, especially the wings. They are rubbery and have a lot of fat on them. The bartenders are too busy gossiping amongst each other to help out the patrons. and the worst part? The price! Ridiculously high for what you get. Nope. Never coming back. I learned my lesson.",1.0
Came in for a quick coffee and was immediately a little disappointed to find that they only had a light toast. I'm only basing this review on that roast and take note that I'm more of a dark roast kinda guy. I found the coffee to be nothing special in terms of flavor. I didn't get to spend much time in the space but it looked like a really cool spot to do some work or have a meeting.,1.0
Was very pleased to find this company. They walked me through the process with minimal effort on my end after I told them what I wanted. Once I finally arrived I was more than happy with the accommodations and location. Everything I could want was a short walk or drive away. Overall great experience and the customer service was top notch. Thanks.,1.0

"Not exactly luxury! 
I came to Marriot Grand Chateau to see about a timeshare. Lol, I was put in a hotel room with a locked door adjoining another hotel room. Newer looking and clean!

There was no kitchen as I was told, but instead a 4 ft. counter with the coffe pot, an overhead microwave, a sink, and an undercounter refrigerator, dishes and under sink trash.  We had to go out to eat at every meal and that became very expensive!  

The bathroom was a standard hotel package with a shower and tub combo and not the dual shower heads, nor a tub to soak in. I guess by now it is obvious that I won't be happy here. But wait there is more!

I brought my two boys and husband to check out the timeshare, and I had to sleep on a sofa fold out! My two boys are different ages and sleeping together was out of the question, but the sales agent thought it was standard that kids sleep on foldouts! It was a kingbed, one room, with a fold out sofa! There was no room to move around because the coffee table had to be pushed over in front of the refrigerator which was snuggled up to the two person table and two chairs in front of the window. Honestly, if you want to attract members put them up in a room that can accommodate four people that signed up for the tour. 

Our bathroom had no towel bars, so towels were everywhere on the floor after one use. We had to bring pool towels up to the room to shower since the room was only stocked for two on a daily basis even though we checked in with four bodies. Yes, I kept the soap, but we used the single bottle of shampoo\/conditioner everyday between the four of us.

The TV was small, and in front of the bed, but who wants to spend vacation time watching TV. The view out the window was of the airport, but with all the furniture pushed to that end of the room we didn't spend any time looking at the airport , or the beautiful water park at the next door resort!

The prices for food items, in the lobby, for members to purchase were too high! There was milk and partries for sale, but this was a free item at other luxury properties where we have stayed, and WATER too! There was no free breakfast, snacks, hor d'oeuvres, nor a cocktail hour which I expected of accommodations at Marriott. However, the nightly DVD rental of $2 seemed reasonable.

The 5th floor pool is a joke due to its small size, large sales photo, and babies without diapers, gross! Sunday, I took the boys to the pool and the bar was closed. I needed a drink! But the drinks on other days were weak and expensive. $15 for two double rum and cokes and no buzz. Mom's need breaks, too! We took one look at the pool on the 38th floor and left immediately due to the smaller that small size alone! I recommend building a walkway to the Water Park next door!

I must say that the free valet was very expedient and friendly! Actually, all the staff were fabulous, and I liked that there was a security hotel card key to enter the elevators. I felt safe at this property.

Our tour presentation was typical, but not what I had hoped to be offered or presented. I read many reviews of this property and I surely was dissatisfied with the accommodations and amenities. Had I stayed in a one\/two bedroom condo, with more privacy, then my review would have been better.

"St-Viateur is a classic bagel shop.

For 85-90 cents you can buy one of their bagels. They sell them by the half-dozen and dozen. They also serve fresh bread and a few accompanying bagel items like cream cheese.

The line moves quickly. It really helps if you have cash.

They have about 6 varieties of Montreal-style bagels. Be sure to get here earlier in the day because sometimes options such as cinnamon raisin will run out as the day progresses.",1.0
"In Oct. our cat started having extreme problems with his balance - he couldn't walk without falling over.  I called our vet immediately but she was out the rest of the day and her office referred me to another vet, which I promptly brought him to.  After some testing, she wanted me to take him to VNC for a neurological exam.  This vet wanted to start him on steroids but VNC said no, they wanted to see him first.  The next morning we went to VNC and our cat was examined by a vet, Dr. Evans, who thought he might have vestibular disease but spent a good deal of our time trying to convince us to have an MRI and spinal tap done for $3,000.  While we would do anything for our pets, we thought this price was astronomical and said we would think about it.  We got him to our regular vet the following day and she gave him an antiobiotic shot and steroids, which have totally cleared up the vestibular disease.  If an MRI was the only solution, we would have done it but we had to try other methods first.  Please do research and don't let them talk you into such an expense at a time when they should be offering you support instead of giving you the feeling that this is more money driven than truly caring about both your pet and you.",1.0
"I really want to give Rudy Boy a better rating. Their food is delicious and I am obsessed with the heat in almost every dish and especially the jalapeno ketchup! However, the service leaves way too much to be desired. I live quite close and order take out from here on the regular. No more. The last two times I've gotten take out, they forgot one of my items (though when I called to tell them they apologized and gave me an extra item for free). The last time, not only did they forget an item, they shortchanged me $10, which I did not realize until a couple of days later. As well, the last time I went there for a sit-down meal, it took about 25 minutes before someone would acknowledge us. There were only two other full tables in the place. We waited for about 15 minutes and then I went to the counter to ask for some attention. The server there was facing the other way, entering something into the computer or till or something, and then just kept facing that way for 10 minutes. I got the sense that she was personally ignoring me but I can't fathom why, as I don't know her beyond coming into the place. Finally, the other server came and served us, but the experience was already ruined. I'll get my burgers somewhere else from now on.",1.0
"I really like Port of Subs, but this location is the worst! The owner\/manager totally rips customers off by using the smallest portion of all the ingredients I've ever seen. He will scrap mayo and the mixed sauce off the bun like he's using caviar. The larger the sandwich the more he spreads out the meat so it appears it has filled the bread, but it's just an illusion. He rations pickles, olives and tomatoes too! I can't handle it!! I will never return. He has done this too many times. Just go to the location off Warner and Val Vista - this guy is the sandwich monitor. And all his employees seem to fear him, they may need help, and be afraid to ask.",1.0
"Entrance is confusing. Same suite number but no open sign on and nothing on door welcoming guest. Coffee mediocre-could have made it at home. Chocolate chip cookie hard and tasted old and blueberry crumb cake was over dry and gooey on top. Not the best. Employee was lovely but owner seemed sketchy-like very nosy and not too welcoming. Def won't go again.

*owner did not say good morning when he came around like he states-esp as this was in the afternoon already.  He most def did not look interested if the customer was happy-actually didn't acknowledge customer just interrupted transaction to speak to employee and then to walk away not making eye contact at all. And open sign was not on above door and place looked empty, again being afternoon, which created confusion in first place. Also seems like your reply is a little degrading by stating front door is under open sign which is not appreciated. I will def let others know not to support this business.",1.0

"Where do I begin...My friends and I decided to check it out and I was disappointed. Not only did our food come out after 45 minutes but my order didn't come out until they were done eating. Then, only half of my order was completed. For a restaurant that relies on word of mouth advertising, they need to get this customer service part down. Both the waiter and Manager did tell us how they only had two cooks and stated the next time I come in, I can get a free cup of coffee.
The food was good but they have a long way to go. I don't think I'll be grabbing that cup of coffee anytime soon.",1.0
I love love poke and had to try this place my usual go to is Ahi Poki. I liked how here they have different options in toppings such as kim chi and chicken as a protein. I had the tuna and salmon bowl with half brown rice and salad. It was delicious. The thing i disliked was that for extra seaweed salad and crab you have to pay extra. Also their servings are a bit smaller than Ahi Poki and price is a little bit more as well.,1.0
"They have really declined. First couple of visits the reservation was right, staff was good and food was cooked as ordered.

"Ordered the atlanta falcon special, a chicken sandwich with waffle fries and coleslaw snd mini bottle of coke. They didnt have the mini available so they served me without the drink.

That was an overcharge by the cashier.

Who doesn't love butterflies . This place was amazing. So many beautiful butterflies. I was impressed with how many this exhibit had. The set up and grounds were so pretty. It is also a very peaceful sanction to be at. You can relax here and take in the beautiful gardens. I was checking this place out for a school field trip. It is very educational for everyone. Plus the gift shop is amazing. I loved the large selection of Eric Carle products. (The very hungry caterpillar) this is a wonderful place to visit in Arizona.,1.0
"I wish I could say that Stacey took my previous review seriously, but the ""service"" has only gotten worse. This eatery not only doesn't answer the phone (because you have to call to confirm Eat24 orders since the staff is negligent with checking email \/ notifications), their ringer is off and voicemail is full. 

This may be fine for dine-in, but 20 minutes just to confirm a carry-out order is far too long. I'd suggest going around the corner to Vegenation, though.

"Maybe I got lucky but my recent foodie experience at Le Papilon was one of the best I've ever had.

After visiting the St. Lawrence market, I wanted to treat my wife to a Sunday brunch. I quickly cruised through some reviews and Le Papillon On Front stood out. Both good and bad reviews about service and certain types of food but overall better than average. Sounds like I need to make my own judgment. OK, je vais essayer (Ok I will try it!).

Nice little al fresco patio in front of the main entrance but a little too chilly for us to dine outside. Quickly looked at the menu posted on the front window. Crepes - SOLD! Walked in and I am welcomed with a caf√©\/wine bar that separates the front and rear dining areas. The host greeted us and we were quickly seated to a table beside large windows that brought in just enough lighting to make us feel comfortable and warm. I took a quick peek behind the bar and was amazed how large the rear dining area is. A little darker but the lighting from the ceiling and wall sconces added to that romantic, fine dining ambiance.

After looking over the menu and trying to make a few indecisive choices, our server Tom, quickly introduced himself and asked if we were ready to order. We asked if he had any recommendations with their crepes list and he quickly pointed out 3 popular dishes. So we decided to try the St. Laurent ($15 - strip bacon, fresh cooked apples, cheddar cheese) with a side of maple syrup (extra $2 - You gotta have this!) and also ordered the Croque Monsieur ($15). ""With a fried egg ($2)?"" Tom asked. ""Sure why not!"" I replied.

Our food arrived in just a little over 15 minutes. The portions of each ingredient were spot on. Crepe cooked through perfectly. The combination of lightly salted bacon, the slight tarty taste of the cooked apples, melted cheddar cheese, and the oh-so-sweet taste of true maple syrup is an absolute must-try.

But wait, the Croque-Monsieur! Well it becomes a Croque-Madame when you add the fried egg (I'm still scratching my head why adding the egg makes it a Croque-Madame). Black forest ham, b√©chamel sauce, and more cheese please! A little bit of green salad topped with a vinaigrette dressing and a side serving of crunchy French fries were both fantastic. But the egg on top of the Croque-Madame just made the dish. I mean breaking the yolk and having it mix in with the b√©chamel sauce just tied everything together. What I love was that both dishes were great to share. 

The service was excellent! Tom checked up on us, gave us time and space to enjoy our food. Even after waiting for the bill, the host was gracious and helpful to take our plates away while speaking a little French on the side. It was the perfect Sunday Brunch!

"I went into Best Buy to get a new Samsung 4k 65"" Tv.
I went in the first time to check out what was available and see what sales were running.
I was conflicted with buying either the Qled or the regular led.
I spoke with Avlon on the first visit who said that there was a Qled on sale.
I looked at it and said that I did not think it was led that it was just 4k led.
He assured me it was Qled and it was on sale as well.
I decided to do a little more research at home as the sale went thru July 8th.
I went back yesterday and spoke with a manager Luke who was very knowledgable and said the one i saw was regular led not Qled.
Luke was very friendly and helpful and I ended up getting the regular 4k led.
I got installation as well and will update the review once it is done.
I would say my second experience there with luke was a 5 star experience unfortunately I do not like when I am given incorrect info like Avlon did on my first visit.
I would of been very upset if I got the tv thinking it was Qled only too find out later that it was not.
I give Avlon and the first visit a 2 stars as he should know about the products he is selling.
overall with Luke helping me the end result was good and the final experience was good.
I can't give more than 3 stars though as I can not get over the fact that on my first visit I was given incorrect information.",1.0

"Decided to give this cafe another chance, so we came here on a Saturday, they were really busy and  we knew there would be a wait. Empty tables but people in the restaurant business like myself knows that was probably due to the kitchen being backed up. The staff was polite and we didn't mind to wait. So we got seated about half an hour later. Got coffee and water and never got any refills throughout our brunch there. We asked twice, didn't happen. Food took awhile, although it was worth it. That's where the three stars come in for food. The missing two stars are due to service. We watched three tables get their food prior to ours when we were seated before. When the rush died down and the restaurant was more vacant, an elderly couple were seated next to us and In ten minutes they weren't greeted or acknowledged. They actually ended getting up and walking out and not one staff member noticed. Always willing to give businesses a second chance, but this was the second time service was lack luster .. food great.

"Vegan junk food.

I would personally rate the food a two star but the service and concept deserves a five star!

This is not gourmet vegan mex. I would compare it to the omnis version of a ""Robertos"" type place. Junk food.

100% vegan. Grub Hub and Uber Eats.

We tried a variety of items most of which have Daiya :( cheese. But I can overlook that because we completely forgot to request minus. *punches self in face*

Chorizo Quesadilla- not sure what we were thinking ordering this, the chorizo was yum but we couldn't get past the Daiya goo factor. It was warm yet had that outer crispiness, prepared perfectly.

Wet Burrito-best item we ordered, huge a filled with yumminess we opted for Ascada and glad we did.

Potato rolled tacos- fried and crisp these were super yum but of course they are fried. The white looking lettuce and mayo globs were a shock and total taste turnoff but the fresh sliced avocado on top made up for the goo globs.

Nachos Al Pastor-covered and piled high these had amazing flavor. The meat choice I picked was a great decision. Once again I should have opted minus the Daiya shreds goo and the glowing bright white lettuce.

The hibiscus water is soooo yummy. Its NOT sweet and the tart taste goes perfect with the food. Wish I opted to try the Horchata but neither hubs nor I like cinnamon nor care for sweet stuff.

All and all the food is fast food, I'm willing to try other items like the tacos....but we do not like corn tortillas and wish they would opt for greener lettuce and less processed products.

"I didn't have some problems. brought two bags of my old items (many second hand), got around $30 for 10 (haven't brought some very expensive brands, mostly shirts, dresses, skirts) and got 8 of their items, my deducted bill cane to $50ish. things I got were aritzia, zara, fp, ae and such, in great condition. Their exchange policy is okay, I like this chain much much more than kind exchange, there is a better and bigger choice and more suited to my needs. I am not giving 5 stars because I don't think bluenotes or joe fresh items should go for $12-13 which is same like they price aritzia or free people, I liked the items but I am not that crazy to pay that much for used bluenotes or joe fresh. there was a nice pair of ankle booties but sadly one zipper didn't work at all so it was impossible to try both on. will be back to exchange, buy and sell :) if the location wasn't totally out of my way or if we had a car, I'd be there more often.",1.0

"Welcome to the magical land of sizzling proteins and delicious drinks!!! The fajitas are really flaming! Oh man, why did I wait soooo long to visit?!?!?
Came on a gorgeous Sunday evening, hoping to sit outside and enjoy the weather. The patio already had a large party there and our group was large too, no sweat, we can sit inside. 
The restaurant is fairly large with a sort of divided dining are, a patio, and a bar that's separated. I like that it accommodates what ever type of night you're looking to have.
Now the food! I absolutely LOVED the shrimp and steak fajitas! I typically don't order steak unless I'm at an actual steakhouse but took a risk and it paid off! The steak was tender, not at all chewy and had wonderful flavor. The shrimp was great as well. Perfectly cooked with flavors of pepper and onions it was cooked with. I really enjoyed watching the server torch the fajitas, a nice touch that adds flare to the dining experience. 
The fajitas are paired with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, and freshly made tortillas - corn or flour. You're able to swap the tortillas for romaine wraps, as well as rice and beans for steamed vegetables. Great option for the health conscious. I personally would not sacrifice the flour tortillas for a few calories, they were delicious! Oh, the fajitas also came with a little bowl of soup! I really did not need it as, the table tortilla chips were pretty good and kept me busy while waiting for the food.
Another star of the show for me were the margaritas. ON FIRE! I had the raspberry margarita that got me buzzed, followed by a shot of tequillaaaaaaaaaa, then a pina colada margarita... The Pina Colada Margarita was my fave, perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I look forward to having it again and again :)

"Came here for archery tag with a group of 15 or so people. We were given a briefing via a pre-filmed video in the store before we went in. It would be useful to have a ref spend a few extra minutes to make sure everyone knew how to load their arrows and properly shoot.
Playing archery tag itself was super fun, but I wish they would've stuck to the rules that we were told of on the ""how to play"" video... There is no target board, so many players have no incentive to leave safety.  Games were very long (12min). Players that were tagged out were immediately allowed to go back in- the games would've been sped up if, like they said in the video, people had to stay out for the remainder of the game if they were tagged.

"Ramen Hashi is brand new! It's a neat little place in an unassuming row of shops. The owner is very welcoming and enthusiastic about his business. As of right now, there is only a ramen bar set up (no other tables\/booths), so it's definitely a restaurant better suited to one or two-party diners. The bar gives you a view of their open kitchen layout though, where you can watch them actually make your food. 

Hashi makes their noodles in-house, which gives them a unique texture. I was informed that their signature broth is the shio, which they make with a chicken base. Think homemade chicken soup, but with ramen noodles. I thought the broth was incredibly flavorful and struck a nice balance with the fresh noodles. It usually comes with chasu, but he gladly subbed in an extra egg for me.

I mostly buckled down and did work, but after getting up early the next morning, I checked out Yelp to find out this place was right down the street. My cold brew was stellar but my whipped cream strawberry donut extravaganza was the real star. Started to walk out the door. Went back for some cream brulee bites. Was not disappointed.

"I admit, I have been staking this place out for about a year. I'd drive past but every time I had intentions of visiting, something would come up. But today I was able to make my initial visit. The first person I got to talk to was Ty himself. Ty was a very down to earth and humble man. 

We ordered our food and sat down in the dining area. The area was clean and well-kept. After about 10 minutes or so, Ty brought out food to us. It was piping hot and smelled delicious! My first first bite of the henny wings was magical. I knew this was a match made in heaven lol. 

My wife had half teriyaki and henny wings. She loved hers as well. I had two sides with mine; the mac and cheese with the collard greens. Both were exquisite. I loved the portion size because I had another full meal out of this one. 

All I can say is that Ty's Wings and Tings is the real deal. I hope to be a regular to this establishment so that I can try all of his other dishes. Come try it out, I know you'll love it too!",1.0

"A few months ago, I was experiencing some irritation in my right eye and wasn't sure of the cause. It seemed to happen in the morning time and the irritation would last a few hours and leave my eye extremely dry and red. I used over the counter eye drops and nothing! Finally I found Wellish Vision Institute because I couldn't take the irritation and saw they had great reviews. I was treated by Dr. Isaac Ortiz and let me just say, he is one of the best eye doctors I have met. His staff treated me very nicely from the beginning, they gave me all kinds of eye exams to rule out what the cause would be and by the time I saw Dr. Ortiz I was in a lot less pain. He was very knowledgeable in explaining all of the different things it could be and really took his time with checking me out and making sure I was comfortable at all times. Turns out it was a bad allergic reaction to my face wash. I had seen an eye doctor before Dr. Ortiz but he couldn't figure out what the issue was. So thankfully Dr. Ortiz was able to figure it out. He gave me all kinds of eyedrops that are so much better than anything you can get at a drugstore. He also educated me on what they do and how to prevent my issues. Overall, it was a great experience and will be using Dr. Ortiz as my eye doctor from now on!!",1.0
"Updated review for the new location. 

Same awesome food, same reasonable prices, same great service. Ambiance still comfortable and mostly unpretentious -- the new building is much bigger, with pool tables and much more seating, plus bonus high ceilings with exposed ductwork for extra hipster cred. 

The only downside is the parking. I was a HUGE fan of the old location in the unpretentious, crummy-fabulous Commerical Center; this new spot is a slight bitch if you're driving a car. There is street parking in the Arts District, which depending on day\/time might be free....and there's a big free lot across Charleston, by the Arts Factory. But you can't just park out front and walk in, like at the old place. (Tip: there is a back entrance, so if you do park in the Arts district, you can come in thru the rear alley instead of walking all the way around the block to the front.) Also, there is no bike rack...but we locked our bikes to the iron railing next door, which seemed to be OK.

But the parking inconveniences are made up for by the improved people-watching: big plate-glass windows up front offer a primo view of the crazy pedestrian traffic on Charleston. 

I have probably tried 75% of the menu so far, and it has all been excellent! I will definitely be back.",1.0
"I had the opportunity to try Stickler's Ice Pops at a Concert in the Park in Zelienople this past week. I only had enough cash for one and it was very difficult to choose a flavor! Raspberry & Mint, Chocolate Banana, Watermelon Kiwi- they all sounded so unique and delicious! I went for the Pineapple Basil Pop and WOW was it good. It tasted so fresh with the delightful combination of fruit and a fresh herb. I loved it. There were a lot of children at the Concert in the Park event and it was so great seeing them run up and order a healthy, delicious Popsicle and enjoy it. Why buy Popsicles with a bunch of preservatives and an excessive amount of sugar when you can have healthy natural ones?! I was really impressed with this place and I am looking forward to keeping an eye out for Stickler's at upcoming events this Summer!",1.0
"3.5 stars, rounded up to 4.  What's with the lack of love for this place?  I visited Le Madeleine for a late lunch one day.  They are located in Mimi's former location, following the fire several years ago.  However, unlike Mimi's, Le Madeleine is more of a fast-casual place, rather than a sit-down restaurant. 

Having never been before, I needed some time to decide, and the staff were very patient and helpful.  I selected a quiche lorraine, a creme br√ªl√©e, and a water, all for $10.  I think that is pretty reasonable for this caliber of food.  

The quiche was precooked and heated so it could be served quickly.  Regardless of the reheating, I thought it was delicious.  The creme br√ªl√©e was served cold so the topping wasn't really crusty, but it was still delicious.  

The dining area is very cozy and comfortable.  Nicer than a Panera, and certainly better than any fast food joint.  

I like that Le Madeleine has many options for meals, including samplers and made to order crepes.  This place beats any of the food court options in the mall, and is worth the drive across the street.",1.0

"My daughter called them to see if they sell their hotdog buns. She was told yes by the girl who answered the phone.  I drove all the way over there to buy 4, yes only 4, buns and they wouldn't sell them to me.  I would have had to give 24 hours notice. Ridiculous. Why weren't we told that on our initial call. Horrible customer care. Won't be back for ANYTHING from this place until they change to honest management.

So I'm the daughter who made the ""initial"" phone call. I've worked in the food service industry for 10 years.  Never in my life would I allow a customer to walk out the door empty handed after one of my employees told that customer that they could place that ""to go"" order. The employee who answered the phone actually placed me on hold to ask the manager on duty (aug 31st) if they took orders to go for their hotdog buns, she returned to the call and told me ""yes we sell our buns to go"" me replying ""ok I'm on my way I'll see you soon"" and the employee responding ""ok I'll see you soon"" After making the 20min drive (40min round trip) we were told that they would not sell us any buns because they didn't have enough for dinner, this was after watching the manager pull down a tray of 10+ buns and returning to us then saying they only had two buns and would not sell us any. After explaining the situation even further the manager became extremely rude and somewhat hostile. I will be taking this issue to corporate bc of the EXTREME unprofessionalism. 


See photo::
We ended up going to Frys (no joke) they had the same buns. All you need to do is ask the bakery (who is fabulous mind you) and they will guide you to these buns. Just spread a little butter on the outside edges and toast them like you would a grilled cheese sandwich. 
Our goal tonight was ""clam boats"". You butter and toast up the bread filled then with clam strips, coleslaw and a garlic aioli!! Yum yum and you have a clam boat. 
Avoid the headache and poor customer service and head over to Fry's two blocks away. Their bakery and customer service is like sipping a pina colada on a tropical sunny beach.. and you don't need 24hrs notice! 
Also noted we put 8oz of clams strips in these buns and they could have held 12oz easily!",1.0
"The food was decent. Gyro sandwich was excellent. Shrooms were okay but too small. The salad just so so. It took forever to get our order. When it came the food was cold.

"I go to this dealership all the time to take my car in for an oil change. I usually do not leave negative yelp reviews  because you don't get both sides of the story when you read them. 

Well, here is my story... whoever KATHY is in the service department is beyond RUDE. I called to inquire about a repair cost and she dominated the conversation- I couldn't get a word out. I was trying to get clarification on the dealership diagnosis and my deductible- since I was charged and my engine light is still on. I already knew something needed to be fixed, I just wasn't sure if the fee would go towards the repair. I don't need attitude from the so called receptionist. It's your job to answer my questions!!!! She wouldn't let me speak- before I could even ask another question, she kept over talking me and when I asked to speak with someone else and she said she's the ONLY one working. 

Hearing that something is not covered wasn't a big deal because I'm aware of the warranty process- the repairs were under $100. With the customer service experience I had over the phone- it makes me want to take my car to another dealership. She raised her voice at me when I asked the same question because I didn't understand  why I was charged...She is incredibly rude and needs to be coached. I'm sure this isn't the first complaint they got from her- if you don't want to be nice to customers- find another job ! I wasn't being rude to you- so don't represent your company in that  manner. I'm disgusted with the way I was treated by her.",1.0

I had a feeling this might happen again and went to wait for her at the front. He took the bill to the back and made her pay $20 for her room fee even though he told her at the beginning it would be free.

I ordered the tasty grass drink which is ice blended milk with brown sugar, honey boba and grass jelly. I ordered it with half sugar but it was still very sweet will go less next time. The problem with the ice blended drinks is that all the sugar is on the bottom. You need to mix it and usually you just shake your boba upside down and let the syrupy goodness flow all over. However, this cup came with a lid and wasn't sealed so it was a bit hard to get the drink to taste evenly throughout. I was stirring with my straw. The boba was nice and chewy and the grass jelly was great. It's denser than most places which I like so you get huge chunks of it. 

My friend ordered the winter melon drink with half sugar as well. Compared to mine, his was not sweet at all. I would rather have less sweet than super sweet. But 1\/2 sugar varies with each drink I guess. I think I'll be back again!",1.0

"First, I would like to say that the majority of the staff there are very nice, very courteous and very friendly.   My overall experience however was not great.  I had my first appointment\/consultation on January 30, at 12:30pm; when I made the original appointment I was told to plan on being there for 3 hours, not a problem but when I did get there I told them that I was aware of this and that was fine but I had to be somewhere by 4:30.  Nearly an hour later(48 minutes to be exact) I was still sitting in the waiting room and watching people that came in after me getting called back for the first step (vitals).   I was finally called in and the nurse\/medical assistant apologized for the delay and the ""mix-up"".  I was then taken to the next step for the blood draw and EKG; I was given a copy of the EKG and I was told I would have the blood work results in 15 minutes, I never received them. I was then taken to speak with one of the wellness coordinators, she gave me a lot of information and told me she would follow up with me in a few weeks via phone call.   I emailed her on February 7, with some questions, as of this date, no response.  I then contacted Blossom on their Facebook on February 10, asking for a copy of the blood work results to be mailed to me, no response, I sent them another message on February 14, this time I received a response but only asked me to call their office, which I did and received. Interesting that I received a statement of what they were billing my insurance for before I received the results.",1.0

"So I went here last month for the first time on a Sunday for brunch, sat at the window table in front and had a good experience...food was good and even though the waitress was new she was pleasant. Fast forward to today...AWFUL experience! I was alone so I sat at the bar. The bartender (whose name I believe was Anthony) was so busy giving the only other guy at the bar drink samples that he completely ignored me. Eventually another guy saw me looking around for someone to acknowledge me and asked me if I wanted water and brought me a menu. Anthony kept doing everything else besides acknowledging me at the bar. It was so bad to the point that I asked the other guy if I was able to order food at the bar because I wasn't getting any service. Anyhow Anthony finally came over to take my order...I placed an order for  frenchtoast, I asked him could I sub the fruit for tots he said ""no, the fruit is complimentary"" ummm ok, well let me order tots, eggs and bacon. Then after he told me two eggs were $5 I saw a combo that came with eggs, bacon, tots, beer, and fruit...so I asked ""if I order the combo is it cheaper?"" At this point he got frustrated and said ""it's your meal"". Ugh. Anyhow, food came out, again Anthony nowhere to be found because he is giving another employee a head massage at the end of the bar (yuck, you're  handling food and making drinks...and no he didn't wash his hands). So the other guy was kind enough to bring me salt and pepper ketchup, and extra napkins. Anthony never brought the beer or side of fruit this meal came with and was pretty over it at this point so didn't even worry about it. Food was decent. Needless to say just not a good experience. He acted like I was inconveniencing him or getting on his nerves! So sorry for bothering you! Rest assured my patronage will not be a problem again!",1.0
"Thanks to a good friend\/coworker's recommendation, I was able to try out this Thai restaurant downtown. It's a good hole-in- the-wall spot located in an area I probably wouldn't venture to if she hadn't been there so many times. We were greeted by a nice young lady and were seated right away. We sat by the stage area and I thought they had karaoke. One of the workers told me they will have someone sing I've in half an hour. It was around 6:15 p.m. on a Friday night so I'm guessing they have live music weekends? Cool either way. It's a charming stage to add to the vibe. 

I ordered the chicken pad Thai in spicy level number one and my friend ordered the pad se ew in spicy level number three. Food came out fairly quickly and the portions were enough for seconds or even thirds! My friend suggested the fried wontons as well. They were good, but not my type of appetizer. The wontons were folded into a triangle shaped and filled with a dollop of ground pork. It was crispy and came with a side of spicy vinegar like dipping sauce.  If you like crispy and crunchy apps, then you would like the fried wontons.

The chicken pad Thai was very flavorful. It had a slight heat to it and that's when I realized our spice preferences were mixed. My pad Thai was supposed to be a one level and I got spice level 3. My friend's pad se ew was a level 1 instead of a 3. Not a big deal actually because the little extra kick of heat was quite tasty. Although I think my friend was kind of missing some heat, but she said she was fine as it was. The waiter came back to check on us and we informed him of the spice level mix up. He quickly offered to redo the food, but we said it was ok because the food was still delicious. 

All in all, the food was hot and delicious. The prices were affordable and you get a lot of food for it. Service was attentive and it had a no frills kind of atmosphere.

Our server apologized and it definitely wasn't his fault- but again, empty booths everywhere and we were told the kitchen was behind. 
The food itself was okay. It was kind of weird- the fajita chicken had some sort of gravy on it and no bell peppers, just onions. Meat was over cooked and under salted. I'd get a better bang for my buck and authentic Mexican food elsewhere. It's just kind of generic... nothing with the flare that a typical Mexican restaurant provides.

"Before choosing Peters and Associates I had read reviews on most places in Las Vegas and was planning to go to multiple consultations. P&A was the first place I went and I decided not to go anywhere else. I was lucky and got to meet with Judah Zakalik for my consultation, he immediately put me kind of at ease (I was a nervous wreck) and did not make me feel like a failure for declaring bankruptcy. After the initial consultation and signing of the contract, I spoke with multiple people.. all nice. Jennifer ended up being the attorney to file my papers and come with me to court and she is a rockstar. When I got to court I was super nervous because I couldn't find my social security card..luckily Jennifer already sent it in. All the other attorneys were talking to their clients and preparing them for what to say and making them look over documents. Jennifer met with me for a minute and then sat down. In my head I was thinking she is either terrible or she is just that good...spoiler alert! She was just that awesome. I was in my 341 hearing for all of 3 minutes. 2 months and like 2 days later I received my discharge.

The only con is they are extremely busy so it may take a few days to get back to you.

"I apologize for the reference to explicit language - it's a direct quote from a worker.

I live up on Mt Washington.  I've been here for coffee before and it is so-so.  This review is largely about the horrific service and attitude.  I've had the barista roll his eyes at me & sigh heavily when I asked to order a black coffee (literally the easiest thing in the world since he just had to pour it).  

Today however, one of their workers was carrying trash on the sidewalk (& needlessly taking over the whole sidewalk) and when I asked him politely to let me go around him ""Excuse me"". He responded with ""Excuse you, Excuse me, F*ck you."" Regardless of whether he wanted to move aside (there was plenty of room if he would have just picked a side), that reaction was so grossly uncalled for and unprofessional. 

I wouldn't recommend going here ever!  There are better options that aren't that far away - Grandview Bakery is literally half a block back on Shiloh and can do basic tea & coffee.  If you are looking for more cafe style options - Cafe Cravings is a little bit of a hike, but totally worth it (awesome people, coffee & food).  They also have a pop-up across the street from the Duquesne incline. Down in Station Square there is a Crazy Mocha.",1.0

Himals combination platter: a little taste of everything from their dumpling,  flat bread, curry for the day, and samosas! I would recommend this as they say in their menu as an appetizer. It's a great sampling and super flavorful.

Chicken sikar: you get your choice of jasmine or brown rice or bread. You can't go wrong with any of it, and his chicken was moist and well seasoned. It was a mix of regular stewed chicken but not as mushy and even more flavorful. It came with a lentil soup and while I don't really like beans this soup was really quite good!

The meat to me, is way too smoky-now some may like this, so it's not necessarily a bad thing and I won't judge based off of that.  I'm not a fan of any of the sauces either, unfortunately.  I did enjoy the mac & cheese and the hush puppies.  They come with a sweet butter, which is heavenly.

The service was good.  I sat at the bar and the bartender was very helpful with the menu.  There were beer specials and a variety of beer options.

"Like other reviewers have said, the product is just fine, but the price isn't justified for what you get. I too went in during the ""soft opening"" and got an original cheese bun for 20% off. Even with the discount the price for the quarter bun was just under $6. It was fresh and tasty, without being overly sweet, but there's absolutely no way I'll go back there and purchase another one for $6.50 + tax when I can get a whole cheesecake at Tetsu's for $10 tax in, or 3 larger stuffed Chinese buns for under $6 just about anywhere. It's just bread and whipped sweet cream cheese. They need to lower their prices to Cinnabon classic roll levels to be viable long-term in this market. They may sell 200 buns in two hours now (as they say on their Instagram), but I doubt that will be the case when the novelty wears off in a couple weeks and the price goes up. The bun itself is easily a 3.5\/5, but the cost simply isn't worth it.",1.0

"Quite possibly my new favorite movie theater in the Cleveland area for large format, big-screen movie-going experiences.

The parking is a breeze, and the image and sound quality here is nothing short of stunning.  

I saw ""Interstellar"" at an official IMAX Theater in Westlake a few years back, and it was an absolute nightmare on all fronts.

Went here on a Saturday night ! It was pretty packed but got seated right away! The atmosphere was very dim and the seating area was very small! We looked over the menu and ordered the flights of margaritas  and their well known guacamole on tv! We ordered the pickled corn\/crab\/chile chipotle guacamole ! The guac came out with chips. The chips was really delicious and the guac stood out ! For our main entree we got the pork tacos and the beef pastrami tacos! All the tacos came with tortillas separately and the dish itself with different assorted condiments. In my opinion the pork tacos was okay! And the beef pastrami was not my favorite! The meat was in form of pastrami but the taste of it was very bland and plain! Overall the atmosphere was okay little dim for me! The service was good! The guacamole was very delicious but the tacos lacked a lot of flavor to me !,1.0

My fiance got the Cubano and I got.. Wait for it.. The spaghetti sandwich. First the Cubano was fantastic. The bread was crushing but not overly so. Pickles and mustard in every bite. My fiance, who used to live in Florida, says she's never had better on this side of the states. 

As for the spaghetti sandwich, I ordered it on a wim, because it seemed like something you don't see on a menu at a sandwich shop. Little did I know this was a recipe that has been in the family for generations. An amazing sandwich. The bread was buttery and toasted. Gooey provolone cheese and a garlic aioli really brings the sandwich together.

Excellent jerk chicken! Very flavourful. Smokey and tender. They cook their meat in drum style BBQs in front of the restaurant.  This place came recommended by a friend and it certainly didn't disappoint. Had the lunch special for $5.99 and it was perfect for a quick lunch. It's in a somewhat rundown plaza at the corner of McCowan and Nugget. Look for all the U-Haul trucks. There are a few tables but it is primarily a take out spot.,1.0

"Came here for dinner while waiting to watch a late movie. For a Saturday night, the 20 min wait was not horrible as we were able to sit at the bar with a drink, peruse the menu, and chat with one of the bartenders. 
This was our first time coming to this newer Milestones location and the details in the restaurant were not lost on us, including comfy seating and dim cozy lighting cast off from the large cylinder lighting fixtures and pendant lights.
I had debated between 3 items on the menu (all roughly in the $18-22 price range): portobello chicken with vermicelli; Mediterranean chicken (2 chicken breasts served with goat cheese atop a bed of chickpeas and greens); or the butternut squash ravioli with crab sauce. I ended up ordering the latter. My hubby ordered the rustic chicken sandwich with the California salad.
My pasta was perfectly al dente and served with a lot of saut√©ed red onions, mushrooms, and wilted spinach in a buttery type sauce. I was disappointed to note only one tiny piece of crab in the whole dish, which I had a sneaking suspicion might be the case when I ordered the dish. Despite this, I did enjoy the ravioli overall. I would however strongly suggest to others who may consider ordering this dish to do so mainly if craving butternut squash ravioli rather than expecting significant amounts of crab.
My hubby's sandwich was served on a roll with seeds and dried cranberries in it, and was well seasoned with grain mustard and served with tomatoes. The sandwich came with a decently sized California salad with mixed greens, goat cheese, candied pecans, and strawberries.

"Well, honestly, of my favorite Thai places around here, my thai is usually my last resort. I'm pretty sure they are an extension of Siam terrace or are somehow related, but I'm not 100% sure. Now, when it comes to Thai food, I LOVE pad Thai. If there's other food on the table, I won't even taste it because I'll be focused on my pad Thai. I was trying to decide which place had the best pad Thai. I didn't include places where I found the pad Thai to be inedible, like for example Nitaya Thai, so I ended up with my top four favorite thai restaurants in the area. Surprisingly enough, my thai scored second of the four, by a long shot. The top two were absolutely delicious while the second two were very okay. I didn't expect my Thai to come through with such a delicious dish, because I've had their pad Thai before. It's always pretty good, but this time it was delightful, knocking Siam terrace and pho cafe out of the park. While it was extremely delicious that day, if you want a reliably scrumptious dish every time, head to thara Thai.",1.0
"Came in after midnight and there is a fair amount of people but by no means busy like a weekend morning would be... after waiting to be seated with no one acknowledging my husband and myself they finally came over to seat us. A waitress says I'll be back in a minute- well after 12 minutes she comes and asks what we want to drink and I politely let her know I am also ready to order and she said I have to get your drinks and then come back. I let her know we have waited for a decent amount of time and I would like to just order. Hesitantly she lets me. Now begins the even longer wait... let's hope my good is good because the service and the customer service is horrible and because of this alone I will never be back to this location.

Update... This literally is the worst location all the way around. A customer at another table was sat in the dark because their lightbulb was out and the customer literally changed the burnt out bulb with the table next to him and the waiter just laughed? Wow you can't make this up. The manager is rude to customers and my waitress is completely lost in space.

"I really want to give this restaurant four stars one day - right now it's at a 3.5. Hubby and I dined here on Valentine's Day and it seemed busier than usual (a good thing!).. We live in the neighbourhood and are always excited to try out new restaurants - this location has been through a few ""new"" openings and closures so I wish El Local Loco luck! I hope management reads the constructive reviews here to better those chances.

Space - great Latin music, made me want to keep dancing in my seat, nice layout, artwork, tables, plates etc. We were thinking getting a live band\/mariachi band on some nights would be awesome for the space. 

Drinks - margarita was awesome, hubby had one of the cervezas and it was great

Food - prices - more expensive than the best taco joints in the city (not impressive), portions are about the same, I echo the need for more fish in the ceviche!

Food - the good: the fish ceviche was awesome, the guac was good, the beef cheek taco was yumo and the churro dessert is every donut-lovers dream. 

Food - the bad: the crema they put on some of their tacos was turning bad and they were still serving it (had a definite smell and taste...). I'm hoping this changes as the restaurant becomes more popular as my guess is that it's a vat of crema in their fridge that just needs to be used up faster.  The chorizo in the chorizo taco is giant cold chunks of sausage and not ground up and warm like at other taco joints in the city. In general, it seemed like everything we ordered was a mix of tortilla (fried\/soft), meat\/fish, guac - so that it wasn't as complex and multidimensional as Latin food can be, which other taco joints in the city have gotten right. The menu\/ingredients are thus worth considering as, while the guac is good, lathering it on everything is playing it too safe.  

Customer service - good - management took the tacos with the crema away and apologized.

"Who knew this gem (*wink wink*) of a museum was lurking on campus? Well, I did, actually, but I somehow never managed to get myself here until eleven years after I graduated. 

The museum is a decent size for being in a campus building and is set up for a self-guided tour. There's basically one main path that makes a winding loop through the space, and you can access a tour book through their website to enrich your experience. If you can get a group together, the museum offers guided tours for $2 per person that you can set up ahead of time.

The basic setup is you start with minerals and gemstones, wind into a dark area that showcases fluorescent and phosphorescent samples, then you emerge into fossils. There's a somewhat interactive exhibit where you can smell the past (hint: it doesn't smell great), and you can also peer into the fossil lab through a picture window and catch students prepping dino bones during the week. Finally, you exit into the main event, the dinosaur room. 

The Boaz Mastodon is probably the most famous dino skeleton you'll see in the display, found here in Wisconsin in the 1800s. There's also a pterodon, skulls from a T. Rex & triceratops, and few others whose names escape me. 

On your way out in the hallway there's a small display case with items for purchase that help support the free museum. Parking is on the street and can admittedly be a bit of a pain; during the week it's pretty parked up with staff and students, but on a Saturday morning I was able to park without issue in a two-hour zone. The engineering and Union South lots aren't too far away, but those can fill quickly as well during the week. If you can walk, bus, or bike, that's probably the ideal way to get there. 

Depending on how in depth you want to go it could take anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes to explore everything, so it can be both a great way to kill a few minutes on campus or a destination for those who dig dinos, gems, and fossils.",1.0

"Ashley Johnson is both a consummate professional and my new bestie in NC. Seriously, my new employer wanted me in Charlotte ASAP. I looked on Yelp, found Savvy and they connected me with Ashley. To say she was the BEST thing that happened to us during this process is an understatement. 
I'm well aware that renters are often neglected by realtors who'd prefer the payoff of a sale. But Ashley treated us like valued clients and took a ton of time to make sure we got what we wanted during our whirlwind 2 day trip to find a home. 
First of all, she sent dozens of listings and patiently worked with us to put together a list of properties that satisfied all of our requirements - us being from California and having no clue about Charlotte or its neighborhoods. 
She also connected us with DAYCARE so that our 13 month old son could have fun in a loving, safe environment while we spent the day driving around the city for hours. We were able to focus on finding a new home while our son made new friends and ate Chick Fil A for the first time. (he's a fan) 
However, I think the most telling part of this whole story is that Ashley did not stop searching for our perfect home until we were practically landing in Charlotte and the last one she sent us is the one we ended up falling in love with. She advocated for us (because the owners were trying to sell, not rent) and we ended up signing the lease the day after we first saw it. We met the owner, hit it off and walked away with keys to our perfect new home, all thanks to Ashley's deft diplomacy. 
And y'all, she's AWESOME! So funny, kind and an all around amazing woman. We were so blessed to be connected with her as our guide to all things Charlotte and I'm planning to see her as soon as I get there.

"The highly anticipated opening of Chef Nuit and Jeff Regular's latest restaurant, Kiin, is finally here! Kiin, Thai for ""eat"" will truly bring the taste of Thailand to Toronto. The duo behind Sabai Sabai, Pai and Sukhothai have shifted from their Northern Thai food focus to introduce a variety of traditional Thai dishes that can be found all over Thailand.  Chef Nuit  says that the menu draws from experiences she's had growing up and travelling across Thailand where food sharing is an important part of the culture.  A few of the dishes on the menu also take inspiration from Royal Thai cuisine which is pretty much extinct in Thailand.  However, Chef Nuit learned many of the techniques while in Thailand which attribute to very intricate, delicate and beautifully prepared dishes.

The menu features a mix of local and imported ingredients, allowing guests to experience the different flavours of Thailand. Ingredients such as white turmeric, buffalo basil, wing beans and angled gourd are just a few of the unique additions to Chef Nuit's creations.

My favourite dishes were the Royal Thai Platter, Wing Beans, Braised Short Rib and Sea Bream.  However, I really did enjoy every single dish I tried and was super impressed by the different flavours and presentation of the food. 

Not only is the food incredible, but the space at Kiin is beautifully designed and intimate, with a capacity of 35.  Whether you're here for lunch or dinner, you'll be truly amazed by every aspect of Kiin.

Kiin will be open for lunch and dinner service and is located at 326 Adelaide Street West. Hours of operation are Monday to Friday from 11:30 am to 3:00 pm for lunch, Monday to Sunday from 5:00 pm to 11:00 pm for dinner.",1.0

I love how the menu changes from week to week giving your taste buds new flavors to fall in love with.

The phone calls I have had with questions have been nothing but pleasant and enjoyable. I couldn't have found a better company to trust partnering with for a healthy lifestyle change. I have been beyond impressed with this team, and like my roommates and myself you too will be beyond impressed with the decision to partner with Next Step Meal Prep! 

Thanks for all you guys do, you have our business!!",1.0
"Of course, my eye was drawn to the expensive burgers on the menu and so I enjoyed their Hangover Burger even though I was not hung over. Big beef patty, bacon, cheese, a fried egg and a french fries\/poutine thing on the burger. When delivered to my table, the thing was seven inches tall. Do people try and bite into this monster?

I took much of the burger apart and ate some with knife and fork until it was down to a manageable size. Tasty beef and the egg was nice. Bacon was very bacony.

For my side dish, I chose the mac & cheese which was okay not great. A big portion but needed sriracha for some kick.

Great service and a neat spot that's right off the highway and easy access. Yum!",1.0
"WHAT. IS. THIS. MAGIC. ABSURDITY. 

Edinburgh Festival Fringe is everything I have ever wanted to witness in my life and many more things I never have ever pictured in my head. My bus ticket up to Edinburgh was booked long before I even knew ""The Fringe' existed. So when my friend told me to look it up and the website had a one time pop-up notified me of what this was I FREAKED out. A festival where anyone and everyone gets to perform? A festival built on the idea of existing on the fringe? A festival that fills over 500 venues (and bars, coffee shops, eateries, or wherever else space can be had) throughout a city with thousands of shows throughout the end of every summer? SO MUCH YES.

I attended the 70th anniversary of Fringe for a week and a half this past August. This first review of it, because I damn well expect to be heading back for more, leaves me in a state of writers block. This festival bursts with so much creativity and oddity that it often left me speechless - or laughing, or crying, or questioning life, or just really damn confused. It left me all the things, and with the amount going on it surely throws every attendee on a completely different ride. 

Here is a fun one - at one point I saw a group of people placed another layer of posters over the pillars of show advertisements, straight up putting a bunch of theirs to cover the other shows. At the time I was talking to a performer, who told me to go touch the pillar. These pillars are so covered in layers of flyers that they are a giant cushion - like you can run into the pillar and it cushions you! Seriously, try it. It is kind of fun. The last day of the event we walked through as the flyers were getting torn down and you could see how the layers had piled two feet wide. Crazy! 

And seriously, I have NEVER seen so many flyers in my life. SO much paper. You are walking down the street getting handed flyers every 0.5 seconds and then also getting dragged into ""world record group banana eating"" - everything happening at once. 

Yes, I ate a banana in unison with 30 strangers. It was awesome.

A Russian circus with ping pongs balls thrown across the auditorium, a recently graduate troupe of folks supporting their friends play, the most awkward comedians, free chocolate passed out to audiences, one man stand-up shows, Australian mock yoga retreats that dress the crowd in odd costumes. There are acts that are absolutely terrible, and acts that are absolutely amazing.

Fringe is amazing because it is full of options. You want to spend zero dollars and simply embrace the ""Free Fringe""? Do it! You want to go to the fancy shows? Do that! You can play every show, or simply walk down the street to find the next thing that catches your eye. 

And finally one of my favorite aspects of this whole thing is how many of the performers are out on the street promoting their own shows. Fringe does not seem to divide between a backstage, the whole city becomes the theater. Many shows are in small room, makeshift locations where you might be one of the few there to witness. 

Such a wacky, weird, wonderful thing Fringe is.",1.0
Probably the worse Modeling agency i've ever been too. They charge you 100$ then later on Hit you with another 275$ and more ... this is terrible,1.0
"Here at Mood and Brew they've really perfected the art of the sandwich, as a result, this place is really starting to grow on me...here's my take on all the Mooin' and Brewin'.

I've been here a hand-full of times since they converted from the old Joe Hoopers which used to occupy this same building.  Since then it has been totally remodeled.  From what I understand, Moo and Brew is owned and operated by the same folks that own He's Not (w\/ the Blue Cups) in Chapel Hill.  If you're a UNC alumni, you know exactly what\/where I am talking about.  

Each time I've been to Moo and Brew I always opt to build my own burger.  I am the kind of guy that likes options and likes to craft a tasty-piece of food-art whenever the opportunity avails itself to me.  With their build-your-own sandwich options, Moo and Brew provides me with a blank food canvas to create as I see fit.  I usually opt for the fried-chicken sandwich, on a Martin's potato bun.  From there, I go to town with all sorts of toppings from bacon, to pimento cheese, to onion straws to avocado - your imagination is your only limitation here.  No matter what or how you build your burger\/sandwich it is sure to be served exactly as you ordered it.  Besides the taste, what's really impressive is how well the bun maintains its consistency with all the toppings and add-ons.  Finally, don't forget about the different side and fry options they offer.  Personally, I'm a fan of the parmesan, garlic and olive oil fries.        

As I reflect, I really don't know why I don't come here more often.  The service is always great, and they have a great selection of beers.  I would def recommend Moo and Brew if you are looking for a great sandwich and a cold beer in the Plaza-Midwood area.",1.0
This place is so good and cheap! I had it for takeout and it didn't take long for the order to get to me. The pho came in a HUGE bowl lol not a letdown.,1.0
"They have awesome snacks if you don't want to order them online. The customer service is terrible. I called and asked the price for nail grooming and they said $10. I got there and told them I needed nail clipping done for my dog. We put our dog on the table for them. They groomed his nails. No bleeding. At the counter (the girl was probably high or something because she was mumbling to herself) she charged me $15. I told her ""I called they said it would be $10"". She stared at me blankly. This other worker (this lady) was just sitting on the phone the entire time. Obviously the girl was on another planet so I just told her to charge me and got out. Not coming back.",1.0
"We had pool Daddy for some time now and asked them to pls make sure not to charge us for services we were not advised of and authorized. We also asked them to stop turning off our pool vacuum timer and letting it run endlessly without letting us know.  Both things continued. We finally said no more and gave them a months notice that we were ending the service. After a phone call explaining why we were ending the service, they still came and even though we called them to remind them of the termination they turn around and charge us for them coming after we notified them not come.",1.0
"I hired Dad and Daughter Photography for a special event and they were seamless to work with. Chuck is really easy to communicate with-- he's very quick with text, calls, and e-mails.

They had a very fun set-up onsite at our event, including props and a professional-looking photobooth. I also really appreciated that the light in the photo booth was awesome...one of my biggest pet peeves is when you hire a photo booth and the light sucks. I'm all for bright, flattering light, and their photo booth delivered that.

I plan to hire Dad and Daughter again in the future when I need a photo booth. Oh, and they actually are a dad and daughter. Literally. Together, they worked my event and were very chatty and interactive with my guests, and it made me happy to support a local family business. They printed out as many photo strips as any guest wanted, and they made the HD gallery available to me within hours of my event.",1.0
"We live 5 mins from here and I wasn't sure if it was more of a bar or more of a grill, so I was hesitant to bring my kids here.  But we took a chance on a quiet Sunday afternoon.  We opted to sit on the patio since it was only 100 degrees  it was shady with misters and empty...so very peaceful!  
Our meal was really good.  A variety of burgers and fries along with a few beers.  Very, very tasty food.  So food, location and ambiance were a win in my book. 
The only rough part was the service was not the best, this is why I have docked a star.  It wasn't horrible.  Everyone was friendly.  But they could have been more attentive.  I had to ask for water, and it was quite awhile before we got our check.  But otherwise, it was a good experience.  Again, the service is a minor complaint.  But to get 5 stars from me I like the whole experience to be top notch.  Needless to say, we will return.  With our family in tow or perhaps even a date night.",1.0
"You cannot go wrong trusting Daily Dose for your brunch needs. It is an excellent choice any morning and is in a prime location in Old Town. They do not take reservations so try to get there early to get your name on the waiting list (and yes, there is usually a wait but it's worth it). While you're waiting, enjoy the complimentary coffee or infused water which is a really nice touch. 

Depending on how hungry you are, try out my go to ordering technique - some sort of healthy egg white entree with a pancake on the side (for your guilty side). I got the egg white omelette with a side of fresh fruit, which was delicious, and followed that up with a side order of the cinnamon roll pancake. IT WAS INSANE. This is a warning, if you like cinnamon rolls, you will love this pancake. And you will feel horrible and super guilty later, but it's so worth it. Plus, eating something healthy before kind of offsets the damage, right? And it's actually a cheaper option than getting one of the more expensive entrees.

The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic and lively, the servers are phenomenal, and I like that they often have themed menu items if their is a holiday coming up.",1.0
"This was a nice little surprise. All the pics I've seen on Insta had me like YES! So I went for the drive on a Friday night. I'm originally from NY and besides family and friends. FOOD is what I miss. It's a nice little speciality store with a wonderful patio to dine out at. Me and my sons felt very comfortable to stay awhile. The menu selection was more limiting than I anticipated and asking for a few items seemed to be a unheard of. 
(EX:chicken parm hero)I was told we don't have that!?
I said you have chicken cutlets, mozzarella, sauce, and bread. All you do is assemble them together to make a sandwich. I've seen the pics online that it's been done before. The guy said ok it shouldn't be a problem. I received chopped up grilled chicken pieces in my sandwich with the other ingredients? It was good but not what I asked for or the taste I was looking for. We ordered a few different things including pasta. Which was very fresh tasting and the garlic bread was delicious. My sons enjoyed it. I'll try it again maybe order everything separate and assemble myself.",1.0
"Dined here on Feb. 18, 2017 @ 10:00pm  

Overall a great dining experience with one caveat.  Started our Gallagher's experience at the exterior bar waiting for friends and the staff there could not have been better.  Had two ""Sand In Your Toes"" cocktails which got the party started.  The staff were pleasant and attentive.  

For dinner the Cowboy rib-eye steak was perfect.  20oz of aged beef on the bone was perfect to share with the wife.  In fact, the wait staff split the starter caesar salad and steak at our table without making a big deal about it like other restaurants.  Loaded mashed potatoes and colossal baked potato were great sides as well.  

Now on to the 1 downer.  Checked in 15 minutes early to the hostess and was told harshly ""just come back when your whole party shows up.""  Um...okay, just wanted to let you know, but I digress.  Friends showed up and we went back to the hostess station with everyone and was told ""would you like a booth, we had one open up and it will be ready in just a minute.""  OK.  10 minutes later, it's going to be just 5 minutes.  10 more minutes, it's going to be just a few more minutes.  5 more minutes go by.  I don't mind waiting for a great experience, but I do mind waiting 30 minutes past my reservation when half of the restaurant is empty.  If you're short staffed or don't know how to clean a table just tell me because I'm a grown up and can take the truth.  I'm standing 5 feet away from the two useless hostesses who have no problem talking and gossiping, but can't properly explain to me why we're standing in front of a half-empty restaurant with a useless reservation time. 

Gallagher's deserves it's #1 rating on Yelp because it's that good.  Great food and great service.  I encourage the management to talk to their hostesses about being pleasant\/honest to people dropping $100\/person and not talking down to them.  I almost walked away because of it and I'm sure others have too.",1.0

"With a heavy heart I lob two stars off this show.  It's 'A-OK' but no longer a must see religious experience.   As many veteran fans of this show are suggesting -- someone broke Beatles LOVE.

The original version made me cry before the majesty and beauty of the show.  A strange dream inside a dark corner of the Yellow Submarine.  Where nothing was real.

To be fair I saw that version about 5 times.  The last time I looked at my partner and said, ""Well... we've seen it, haven't we?""  I never see any shows that often (or even twice) but the original Beatles LOVE earned these return visits.  It was really that good.  One of the best shows of anything on the planet.

This new version... is broken.  

Was too much changed?  No.  But enough?  Yeah.  I've seen this version twice now.  The changes didn't grow on me.  I can't name one that was an improvement -- except for seeing the many African American faces during Blackbird.  And Beatles faces everywhere.  But even the Beatles mugs were ruined by lowering down TV screens here and there which is an aesthetic anachronism.  A show that's set in several pre-digital periods shouldn't be invaded by post digital tech.

In general I'd say the new production boldly tries to fix sleepy parts of the original show.  Why do I say sleepy?  Because as the years went on I discovered (much to my shock) certain drunken audience members snoozing away around song 5 or 6.  SLEEPING.   Which is NEVER good. 

So I believe Cirque decided to insert alarm clocks.  TWIST AND SHOUT, for instance, was added to keep things peppy.  Several problems.  It's just shoved between two songs that are already up and bouncy, rendering it ineffective in this department.  It was simply in the wrong place.  Also it's not even a Lennon and McCartney song.

LADY MADONNA used to be a very clever and fun dance number.  The dancing became simplified and the floor comes to life with projected splotches of color.  What was a 'fun and exciting change' the first time became a Disney broad brush stroke.  And therein --

-- lies the problem with this Beatles LOVE.  Every change bashes you in the head.  Like those ludicrous spinning things in OCTOPUS'S GARDEN.  All the subtlety of the first show jack-hammered away.   

Don't believe me?  Someone added HUGE pink balls that are suddenly thrown at the audience.  Like giant beach balls we're invited to toss them about.  Again a way to force the audience to remain 'attentive' while the explanation of which is baffling.  It comes off as desperate and distracted.

And while all these obvious changes to the veteran stare you in the face -- subtle changes irk.  Is it just me or did they let about 7-12 cast members go?   That the new faces aren't just new faces but are doubling up to save the show money?  I swear Mr. Kite was missing half the circus folk it used to have.  It used to be intricate and clever.  It seems sparse now.

I appreciate that change is good.  And necessary.  This last viewing it occurred to me that any young people in the audience would have no real idea why the Volkswagon bugs and bus come and go.  For me it's memory lane but for them they might wonder why we're in a vintage VW showroom.  Way too much of that.  They should all come and go in one song and then bye bye.

Kaka started off as a Japanese all you can eat with some fresh ideas and great execution of those fresh ideas.

The food was a notch above the rest, their deserts were wonderful, and the tasting platter was pretty amazing.

This was around the time they opened up in First Markham.

*** Fast Forward 2016 ***

Deserts have sunk to the standard stuff that you can get ANYWHERE ELSE.  It's not that they just kept things the same and everyone else caught up, it's that KaKa's desserts got smaller, less variety and generally poorer in quality.

The cheesecake I always looked forward to shrunk by half, and there are no toppings(crust crumbles, fruit jams,) on it anymore.  Just plain cheese cake with a berry.

Food is still good, but other ayce places have similar items now.  The overall quality and care of with their food seemed to have dropped which gives less and less of a reason to choose Kaka over another ayce.

I hope it picks back up, but at the moment there really isn't any reason to choose KaKa over another ayce.",1.0
"So we tried Saigon Pearl in Nov, 2016, did not enjoy, and said so on Yelp.  In July, the new manager reached out to me on Yelp and said we are new and improved, please try us again.  So we were driving back from up North and decided to pick-up take-out.  Since we were driving past Saigon Pearl, I thought: what the heck!  DH excused himself and said after the last time, he'd have pizza.  

First of all,I pulled the menu up on my phone, and it brought up something called 24houreats and I was able to order directly from the site, rather than memorize my order and call.  I also had the option to pre-pay via cc or PP as well as cash, which was nice.

Saigon Pearl has moved a couple of doors down from where it used to be, and rather than looking like an Asian take-out, it has a nice dining room atmosphere now.  I was greeted pleasantly as soon as I walked in the door.

My food was ready.  Because it was just me, I had ordered the Saigon Special Pho and the vegetarian Summer rolls. 

Took it home and unpacked it.  The Pho broth comes in a separate container, and another box contains the accouterments; rice noodles, cilantro, basil, lime, etc. as well as the meat.  Everything was fresh, but I'd have liked more cilantro.  I LOVE cilantro.  But I had some in the fridge I added. The Summer rolls are 4 to an order and wrapped tightly two and two to keep fresh.

Imho, the Pho is levels above it's previous incarnation.  The broth was rich and satisfying, the meat was pink and lean and the other additions very fresh.  The Summer rolls were so good.  DH took a bite of one and then ate two!  He said they were great (and added some ""veggie"" to his pizza).  He then tasted my Pho and thought that was delish too. I think he was sorry he'd gotten pizza.  I kept having to fend his spoon away from my bowl!

Based on this visit, we will definitely be visiting Saigon Pearl in the near future.  Congratulation to the new manager for turning it around.",1.0
"If you've ever been to an aquarium -- really any aquarium -- trust me when I say this one won't be nearly as good. 

For starters, the cost to enter is bundled with some kind of virtual penguin exhibit. Two adults and two kids would be $88 for the bundle. If you ask, you can get tickets to ONLY the aquarium, which is $68 instead, but that option isn't obvious. You have to ask. 

The aquarium itself has some kind of pitiful reptile varieties before the fish part, which you breeze through. The fish part itself is pretty mediocre, again, compared to any decent aquarium anywhere in the country.

"Looking to purchase a new Mazada? Great car I've owned three of them however my advise to you is DON'T purchase it from Earnhardt. This dealership is one hot mess! I have been lied to, had countless phone calls and texts ignored in an attempt to get someone to finally take ownership of my issue. In approximately 2 weeks time my salesman was gone as was the finance person, the sales manager and the General Manager who was going to be my
"" personal contact"" to assure my issues were addressed. At the time of purchase I was told I would have my paperwork to bring to the DMV in 10 to 14 days since my credit was excellent.

Well after 28 days I finally have my paperwork causing me to cancel my trip and costing me 3 vacation days at work. Thanks a lot Earnhart Mazada!! I have purchased many new vehicles over the years and this is by far the worse dealer I've ever experienced.

"We have been using Irish for a couple years now, and their service is always fantastic. With this most recent service, they gave me a next day (Saturday) appointment, and they called to say they were on their way, and arrived when they said they would. I always get A LOT of mileage out of their weed control service. No weeds for a very long time. Many months down the line, we may get one or two on rare occasion. Night and day difference compared to our last weed service provider. Irish saturates the ground everywhere weeds can grow. With the last company we had it was very obvious from their tinted product that they missed HUGE areas with every pass of the sprayer. And that company refused to fix the job and respray pre-emergent. They forced us to call every week or so when the weeds got really bad in the many untreated areas, and then they would ask for a 2 hour window, and then they would only put down post emergent. So we would have to deal with that EVERY couple of weeks! 

The pricing with Irish is super low also.",1.0

"After making a decision to remodel our home and not move we set out on our journey to find a contractor that was a good fit for us.  We got quotes from 7 companies until we met DJ from Vetsbuilt. We had planned out our kitchen\/living room renno for 6 months before Vetsbuilts came and provided us with a fair and authentic quote for what we were envisioning our renno would looked like. We laid out a fair timeline of the work that was needed and the pricing involved. Doing a complete kitchen, living room and family room renno, we were more that satisfied that the work could be done in three to four weeks. We also wanted to have our hands in the project and DJ made sure that we would be able to complete our portion of the project while the trades were accomplishing there work.  We are very hands on and made all the purchases for tile, cabinets, granite counter tops, appliances, and our design plan. There are not many contractors that would do this but DJ was on board from the beginning and the project became a reality.
From Demmo day to the end of the project, DJ's team provided top notch and quality workmanship. Anytime a complete remodel is being done you can expect the unexpected.  We had a couple but we were able to work through those with minimal stress. DJ and his team were able to sort through whatever problem they encountered and provided a instant solution to resolve the issue at hand. This to me was one of the key issues that was a bonus working with Vetsbuilt. Happy Wife Happy Life! 
As with most projects we had several change orders that occurred, but DJ and his team made sure that everything that we wanted was accomplished to our satisfaction. This was another great reason why we selected Vetsbuilt, as DJ and I had talked about all the what ifs that could come up before we even began the project. 
Reading reviews can sometimes be misleading so this is what Ill say. DJ and his team led by Ben did an incredible job from start to finish. Sergio the master tiler was amazing. All the trades were very careful and respectful of our home while they conducted there work. There is always some uneasy feeling letting strangers in your home while you are at work but DJ and his team were so respectful of everything.  They were Honest, trustworthy, truthful and had integrity. That really says it all. Would I recommend, Hell Yeah!  Our thanks to Vetsbuilt, DJ and his entire team of trades that came in and did a fantastic job.",1.0

I've always been a fan of soft serve and whenever I find a place that serves a dairy-free vegan version of it, you know I'm down like Chinatown. 

There's so much hype here, the first time I came here, I actually ubered. You can tell how my uber driver's reaction was when he picked me up near Yonge and Dundas and asked ""...am I dropping you off to get ice cream?"" ..and it didn't help that it was negative 20 outside. YA GIRL LUVS HER COLD TREATS OKAY?

I've been here a few times and the only dairy free option in the winter was pumpkin spice, which wasn't the best. In fact, it was kind of weird. Meh. It was probably 2\/5. HOWEVER! Their spring\/summer menu is back and YASSS VEGAN ICE CREAM FROM COCONUT GOT ME GOIN' NUTS. I don't remember the exact name but it was something exotic and it's a coconut dairy free soft serve with toasted coconut flakes and drizzled with dark chocolate jizz. Or not jizz. I mean.. some kind of syrup. It was delicious. I gobbled it up like it was my last meal. It was 100% a 5\/5, I think my mouth begged for more and more. 

Anyways, the downfall of SJ-
It's hella aesthetic aka it's a photo opportunity for all my Instagram thots, so it's really hyped and when places are really hyped, they turn $$$$.. pro tip: never get a ""smallz"" as a size. It's literally a sample cup size of ice cream. Literally the size of a Starbucks hot drink sample cup. For $5? Ya right, bye. The biggie size is A LOT bigger for $7, almost $8. Yo this cold treat is going to make my wallet cry! Why don't they have a medium?
Also, just a simple soft serve without toppings is $5 alone; getting that wouldn't even make sense. Seriously, a chocolate vanilla twist soft serve is $4.95 or something. What.

Ron the owner put it on the lift and identified the problem without charging me. He pulled the pan with me right there watching and evidenced to me the transmission fluid was bright red and no metal shaving or debris were present in the fluid, verifying the transmission itself was in good order. He then showed me where it was leaking from, the front pump seal, and quoted me a very fair price to fix it and proceeded to do so in a prompt and professional manner.",1.0
"Had dinner there and breakfasts. Good menus for both, the breakfast is the real standout.

"Came here for the first time with my family a few weeks ago.  I had this place on my list to try for the longest time.  I'm a huge fan of Japango so it was hard being in the Dundas St. area to pick another Japanese restaurant that serves similar dishes.  I see that a few Yelpers commented that this place was better than Japango which then really caught my attention.  It was obvious as I walked in that this place definitely has a better ambiance than Japango.  It's very spacious and comfortable.

I read that the men who started this place have worked in the Japanese business for many years included sushi chefs from Le Cafe Michi, and Edo\/Hiro.  Not sure if these guys still run the place but I'll definitely ask them on my next visit.  Yes, there will definitely be another visit.  I think that I'll need a few more visits because it hasn't quite won me over compared to Japango.

I read from other Yelpers that the grilled food was over priced so I played it safe and picked the sashimi dinner and chirashi dinner that had great reviews.  I really liked the fish that was selected in the sashimi mix especially the sea bream.  We also had the baked oysters to start and that was delicious.

Overall, the service was great and we really enjoyed our dinner.",1.0

"I wasn't a fan of the food. I dined on the chicken and pickles which is their version of chicken and waffles. The chicken is pressure cooked\/fried and it makes the meat too hard and the overall seasonings were not pleasant. 

The meal is topped with bread and butter pickles and has a side of cinnamon butter and syrup. The waffle was cooked too hard it was like a vanilla wafer cookie with waffle grill marks. 

The drink selection were way too expensive $10, $12 and $16 for drinks the size of shot glasses. 

The atmosphere was nice and the staff was great but none of our party of 10 seemed pleased with their food and most of us had different items. The only person who raved over their food was the short rib burger and I did try it and it was tasty but highly priced at $21",1.0

The baked fries buffalo chicken tenders. 
What? More like greasy sauce, over cooked tenders, mushy fries. I think i got a F'D up stomach from those freaking fries.

Tacos are my favorite food so you have to mess up pretty badly to disappoint me in other words...
I've met few tacos that i didn't like. I will say I prefer the Margarita to the Paloma... which has very little grapefruit flavor compared to other palomas I've had in the past at other watering holes. As far as happy hour goes... there is a margarita upgrade option during certain times where you can get a higer shelf tequila for the price of the well tequila... not super thrilling.
As far as food goes...I prefer the Pollo Verde to taco to any of the other chicken offerings. I did however enjoy the fish taco I tried on one of my visits as well. If you order 3 tacos you get ""free"" rice and beans and if you ask for just rice they will oblige.

"I know exactly what's happening at this course: management trying hard to save money. It's a fun but fading beauty. Many of the greens were thrashed with brown-outs and tons of divots, scoring marks, etc. Some of the fairways getting browned-out, which could be expected in the desert in August. It's a $50, $60 course that they want $100 or $125 for on a weekend--take that tourists!

The design is a lot of fun, mostly wide open fairways, some par 3s that flirt with water, good doglegs, especially on the front. Good elevation changes, and on most holes you get to hit driver. Each hole pretty different. Pace of play was really good too--as a single I did it in about 3 hours teeing off at 10:00 a.m., had to skip through about 3 foursomes but not bad at all.

"We were on our way home and feeling lazy so we hopped in not realizing the time until we hit the door. It was about 11:05 and although their doors were unlocked, their schedule said they closed at 11 pm. The dining room waiter was still more than happy to seat us and even directed us to use the take-out counter once realizing we we're looking for the food ""to go"" as the price from the takeout counter is lower on what we were looking to order. By the time we got to the take out counter (you need to leave the restaurant and walk to the back of the building) it was easily 15 minutes after they had ""closed"". The manager on duty processed our order and we we're happy to be fed!

"You. Get. What. You. Pay. For.

I took about 10 items here (a mixture of pants, skirts, shirts, etc.) and when I got them back one of my pairs of pants had stains ALL OVER IT! They were not there when I took them in. The stains were a very dark color (pink pants) and a very distinct pattern that almost looked like footprints.

So I took them back and they told me they would soak them and get the stains out and call if they wouldn't be ready the following day. A man called and said he needed an extra day and would let me know if there were any issues. When I didn't hear anything else I went back to get them and the stains were WORSE. So they told me they would hang on to them and leave a note with them for the owner to call me.

Well a week went by and I heard nothing. Mind you, they still had my pants this entire time. So I finally called back and he told me that he would write me a letter to take to the store with the pants to get my money back. -__- At this point after 5 trips there and several phone calls I think I'm better off leaving the pants there and taking the loss. Because returning a pair of completely ruined pants to the store with a note from the dry cleaners just sounds absolutely absurd to me.",1.0

They have quite a few garden statues and art installations (including many that light up for evening use). I have to stop back after dark sometime soon to experience the gardens all lit up with beautiful lighting. I noticed that the pathways also had lighting running along the sides.

I said ""sure"" then as I was in line to buy it, she motioned at me to buy 2 more, lol.

The croissants are so crispy and flaky on the outside yet fluffy on the inside with the right amount of stretchiness and chewiness. My mom loves croissants and she felt they were the best she's ever had. 

The Kouign Amann is made in the traditional style (big one then cut into slices like a pie). We got a slice. It was crispy on the outside and slightly sticky from the sugar, and soft and full of layers on the inside. I loved it, but my mom thought it was too sweet.

Staff were very friendly. The place has limited seating (just a couple of tables for 2) but we managed to get one.

If I can't find a spot in their parking lot, I head to this Food Lion. Don't even attempt that HT when Charlotte loses its mind over snowmageddon, come straight here. I don't love the meat and seafood options, but overall this place gets the job done for a basic grocery store run.

It's great spot to grab beer and wine. Pretty decent selection and there's usually deals\/sales of some sort. Shout out to the cashiers for always having an MVP card number for me to use.",1.0
"I am big fan of this chain and have been going to the St-Jerome location regularly since its opening about 3 years ago so I am extremely excited to have this buffet right next door now!

In order to provide a fair assessment, I waited to write my review after now going 3 times in the past month. I went on opening day September 19 and it was big chaos as you can imagine there are thousands of people lined up, not enough food and every single person working there is a brand new hire so you can't expect the best just yet.
I returned a week later for weekday supper and most recently for Sunday brunch and can say this place has the potential to be as great as the other branches. Good food, lots of variety and pricing is very reasonable and frankly unbeattable for what you get.

Yes there are long lines, this is normal considering it's the hottest place in town. What's annoying lately is that they don't allow groups to be seated until everyone is accounted for however as soon as the hype dies down it'll be much smoother for everyone.

TIP, try to go at opening of lunch or supper to beat the lines. So if lunch opens at 11, try to be there for 11 or 11:30.

The food varies based on lunch or dinner and day of the week. I noticed this location has more seafood than St-Jerome and always offers 4 types of sushi versus just 2 at the other location, otherwise everything else is pretty similar. Brunch is my favorite as there are eggs and omelettes made to order, pancakes, french toast, delicious breakfast sausages, bacon and all your other staples like carved meats, chinese food, seafood, pastas, fresh fruits, desserts etc. If you were to go to a regular breakfast restaurant you'd pay the same price and get almost nothing.

Kids under 12 eat free so it's very family friendly and again unbeattable compared to any other restaurants nearby.

For everyone complaining that the service is slow, keep in mind that this restaurant seats 650 people and serves THOUSANDS of people for every meal. Everyone is also new at their job so give them a break.
The staff which is comprised of over 100 employees is already working as hard and fast as they can and unfortunately during opening week there was a huge lack of ressources as many workers that were just hired did not show up. I have a family member who worked during the first 2 weeks and the hours were from 9 am to 11 pm at night, sometimes later. It is very hard labor in the kitchen, prepping and cleaning for minimum wage and believe me, they are pumping out as much food as physically possible to serve everyone. All meals are also prepared fresh daily.

The owner of this establishement described it as a food FACTORY, not a restaurant.

Also just a note, the tips are shared amongst all staff, not just the servers, so maybe this will change the way you tip - even if your server wasn't awesome, everyone else working behind the scenes is deserving too.

In all I strongly recommend this place for casual lunches or suppers, group events or parties as there's something to please everyone. You will not find this much selection and freshness elsewhere.",1.0

"Food: My review is solely for the afternoon tea. My measuring stick is the Garden Court at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco ($68\/pp), which is my standard to compare to. Although I felt the food was delicious and traditionally as expected, the experience as a whole was lacking for two reasons: 1) location - in a bar with a view of the casino, and 2) lack of high end service.

Location: Inside The Bellagio hotel, in the bar right in front of the check-in lobby and next to, with a view of, the casino. Not good.

Ambiance: Since the seating backs up along the casino tables, it is loud with the sounds and smokey smells of the casino. Having afternoon tea is a refined affair, and this environment contradicts and lessens the experience tremendously.

Service: Below expectations for Bellagio. We had to repeatedly flag down the busy waitress for more water to fill our tea pot and more ice water. Since the afternoon tea shares the same area with the caviar bar, I just felt like we were an after-thought and the focus was on those consuming alcohol\/caviar in the front area of the bar. She was not knowledgeable about the different teas nor did she explain what was on the plates. I had to ask.

If they could move this experience to another area of the hotel away from the casino floor and give it the attention it deserves, this would be a way better experience. Given this, Tea Bar at the Mandarin Oriental is superior in EVERY WAY and I recommend skipping this and going there. See my review.",1.0

"Thank you for responding to my review.

$80 for VIP table is extremely reasonable. We actually paid in US dollar and tip your dancers $20\/person. Per your servers, the exchange rate inside your club is 1 CAD = $1, which is fine with us.

Nice save!!!! Unfortunately those two idiots were NOT VIPs. They loudly screamed that they were friends with the group in front of us, but no one in that group recognized them.  We asked everyone in that group.

If they have asked us politely, we wouldn't have any problem letting them in first. Pushing, getting loud and being obnoxious is not acceptable anywhere or under any circumstances. Meanwhile, your doorman did absolutely nothing.  Just standing around and too busy looking out for extra cash. It is a such turn-off.",1.0
"Please allow ZERO stars! We had reservations, which we made months before because of spring break. Arrived and was told our room would be across the street at the MOTEL part of the casino, not the HOTEL. Well, we walked down the sidewalk and across the street to a set of motel buildings that were pretty scary looking, circa early '70s. This was about midnight; we were tired. Our room: mold in the bathroom, hair on the bathroom floor, blood on the shower curtain, holes in all the sheets, holes in the drapes, toilet ran all night. Customer service the next morning was extremely nice, friendly, and apologetic. She refunded all our money, even the resort fee. I should have told her to quick, get a job at a different hotel.

"This place is located right in power square mall so it's a very convenient location. The owner is sweet, but make sure to articulate exactly what you want and possibly bring in a photo. I thought I was clear when I asked her to keep my brows natural and only clean them up, but she made my naturally thick eyebrows thin AF. I think she still did a good job in terms of cleaning, but it would be beneficial to bring in a photo of what you want so she really understands. At the end, she made a comment saying they'd look great if I filled them in....but I wouldn't need to fill them in if she didn't make them thin in the first place. Regardless, she's better than other brow people. It was $10-probs should be cheaper but that's a good price for the area. Secondly, I called her beforehand stating I had an event to go to and was in a rush. I wanted to make sure she had an open spot available before coming in. She stated I could come in right away so I got there and there were 3 people ahead of me. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but I called to avoid this issue since I knew I was running low on time. Basically, if you're not in a rush and just need a simple cleaning of your brows done--she's a solid option. Just bring a photo!",1.0
"The place is absolutely beautiful and asthetic. The flooring is gorgeous it's hard not to look down. The food however not so much. Alot of their dishes were hit and miss. I noticed I liked alot of their fried things better. Some of the sauces that came with the Puri didn't make the Puri taste any better. They also don't have a spice level, and alot of their stuff is naturally spicy, so make you specify when you order. It's cool that alot of the dishes are hallal and they had a good amount of vege dishes. The service was okay. Some of the cashier's were confused when we split the bill, and wasn't the nicest when we asked for modifications on our food. Overall, 3\/5.",1.0
"Sometimes, it doesn't take the best food or wildest decor to get a five star. It's a combination of great, passionate food and warm hospitality. 

The place looks small from the outside and I barely notice it driving by. But you know a place is going to be good when the owner himself greets you with a welcoming smile and each of the buffet options are cooked in small batches with heart and pride. 

The owner checked up on us a few times during our visit just to ask if everything was good. He had such a friendly smile and even though we didn't converse much, he made us feel welcomed and I could sense how passionate he is about his food. Thank you for bringing a bit of your culture to us!

The butter chicken is amazing!! Tender chicken with a delicious tomatoe-y yogurt-y sauce. I couldn't get enough of the fresh naan dipped in there. The goat curry was also very good! The lamb curry had bones with the bone marrow still inside all gelatinous and bursting with flavour! 

Honestly, I get random hankerings for some good Indian food, but never can find a place at a good price with a variety of dishes to enjoy. So glad my fellow Yelpers recommended this place. I'll be back for more!!

The vet was pleasant and informative about what my options were.  They were very gentle and calming to Bailey, who was a bit freaked out-especially when they took his temperature!  I really appreciate how kind they were to both me, Bailey and my mom-especially Mom because Bailey is her baby!  The receptionist even filled out my pet insurance forms and sent them to the insurance company! Will find out more about his diagnosis when we go for his follow-up on Monday.  I just hope that Bailey passes the rock they found in his tummy on the X-Ray!  Silly dog!

"Location: It's in Kensington market, accessible by streetcar or walking, and is surrounded by many different restaurants (in case you get there at like 12:01 and don't wanna wait 15 minutes in line to order)

Price: All tacos are around $5 or $6, depending on fanciness level. 

Food: The tacos are delicious! They're fully stuffed with veggies, guacamole, etc. and held together by 2 tortillas. The meat is very tasty, especially the carnitas. The baja fish is quite good, except it's pretty oily and can't compare to Bareo Coreano or Playa Cabana. 

Seating: The line is very long, and there's only 5 seats. So either come early or take it to go... Or stand ominously over people who are sitting until they leave.

TJ and the guys at Kinkade's were super awesome. TJ shot me a quote within the hour with two possible costs depending on how bad the ac was.

He was straight up and forward, and I am glad he was. My wife and two boys are now riding in a nice refrigerated chariot, facing these nasty summer temps.

"At Hollywood Gelato, I have ""been there done that"" for their gelato many times for at least 7 years. During this time, I have also eaten the gelato at the nearby competition and other gelato shops in the GTA. I have learned how different gelato shops make their ice creams. To this day, I still find Hollywood Gelato the best gelato shop in its area. One of their nearby competitors, years ago, once said that they don't make real Italian gelato. I guess that meant I was eating Canadian Italian gelato.

I am giving Hollywood Gelato a rating of 3.5 stars instead of 4 stars since they still don't offer a gelato stamp card while they have offered a coffee stamp card for years. Gelato customers spend just as much money as coffee customers!

I have eaten most of the gelato and sorbet flavours offered at Hollywood Gelato. My favourite gelato flavours in no particular order are: cappuccino, coconut cream pie, hazelnut, key lime pie, Sicilian pistachio, pumpkin pie (available at Thanksgiving). I am lactose intolerant, but my stomach can handle the gelato. I didn't list any chocolate flavours even though I love chocolate as I satisfied with eating chocolate ice cream bought from supermarkets. I want gelato and sorbet experiences where the flavour cannot be bought from supermarket ice cream. My favourite sorbet flavours in no particular order are: lemon, wild forest berries, mango, and raspberry. The sorbets are lactose free.

I decided to pig out today, February 19th, since my last visit was around last Thanksgiving Day. I ordered mango sorbet, strawberry sorbet, Skor gelato and Reese peanut butter gelato for $7.50 including tax. I loved the mango sorbet. You get the real taste of mangoes and it is not too sweet. I made a mistake ordering strawberry sorbet. I meant to order raspberry gelato, but the server already scooped the strawberry gelato. The strawberry gelato lacked a strong taste. Is it because they used U.S. strawberries instead of better tasting, sweet Ontario strawberries when they are in season. Order the raspberry sorbet instead of the strawberry sorbet. The Skor gelato and Reese peanut butter gelato were OK. I usually don't order chocolate flavoured gelatos for the reason given above.

Not feeling totally satisfied with my gelato experience today, I ordered 2 more scoops. I got key lime pie gelato and Sicilian pistachio gelato in a cup for $5.50 including tax. There was a definite bite of real lime juice in the key lime pie. Also, I could tell there was pie crust in the key lime pie as I chewed. The Sicilian pistachio had a rich flavour, which I liked. These are 2 of my favourite flavours at Hollywood Gelato.

I like Hollywood Gelato so much that I bought gift certificates for myself as a Christmas present in previous years lol. It was a good deal.

I read the Yelp good and bad reviews for Hollywood Gelato. Other customers may have experienced rude customer service, but in the 7 plus years of being a Hollywood Gelato customer I have never had an issue with their customer service. I have been there when it's very busy and when it's empty and there were no problems. Yelp is a popular social media app to make compliants about customer service, but what about making compliants about customers. During my latest visit, I observed a rude customer yell, ""There's no one to take my money!"". Instead, she could have said, ""Hello"" or ""Excuse me"". Was it really that necessary to be so nasty?

"I have an 8month old black lab. Saturday 2\/25 Buddy slipped on a stair and fell down the rest of them. He began limping and then on Monday  I took him in to the vet Banfield(wont go back) The doctor said he has dislocated his hip and basically they had no idea how to do this kind of surgery not to mention I would not trust Banfield to operate on my puppy.  I Took Tuesday off to make some calls and figure out what I was going to do. After calling several vets and everyone being unsure they felt confident in doing this surgery, I called Scottsdale veterinary hospital and they gave me Dr. JHA's number.  What an Awesome office Animal Medical & Surgical Center is!  The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly. They were able to get Buddy in that afternoon at 3:30. My son Michael who is a senior at HS  and myself met with Dr Jha. He was warm, friendly, extremely professional and explained everything to us. I was beyond impressed because Dr Jha wanted to take the conservative approach to try and keep buddy's hip in the joint however we knew that was a slim possibility because Buddy was born with very shallow hip sockets. He thoroughly explained the FHO procedure that would help buddy tremendously and take away the pain and the limping once healed. Dr Jha called me before he started surgery and when he was done to give me an update.  Dr Jha said I could pick up Buddy later that day as long as he was doing good but I said I would feel more comfortable if Buddy stayed over night. So late yesterday afternoon I picked Buddy up. Dr Jha came in and explained everything to me. Went over the surgery and the x-rays before and after. Buddy was Beyond content and at peace with this office. Buddy loved everyone and didn't even seem like he wanted to go home. Zach and Courtney the Surgical Team showed me how to do physical therapy, went over the medications and let me know they were open 24 hours if I should have any questions. Buddy Will most likely need the other hip done eventually and Dr Jha will be doing it. I can't Thank Dr JHA, Zach, Courtney and the entire staff for being so warm caring and friendly! This has been a very emotional and upsetting week for Michael and I. Dr Jha was such a blessing for us! It Means the World to Me!  The facility was beyond beautiful, clean, inviting and warm.  In fact I think it's better than where humans go and stay.  My appreciation goes out to all of you and especially to Dr. JHA for taking care the love of my life!",1.0
"The best lunch special in Las Vegas! Three Courses for $29.00!

Both orders are very large (usually 13 to 15 items total with each item having 4 to 8 servings of 4 to 6 main dishes and 2 to 3 servings of various side items each time). While it's a bit difficult to go get so much food ourselves, we are so happy with this place that we continue to do just that. Everything we have ordered to date has been hot, flavorful, cooked well and just heaven to your tastebuds. We have had the Barg, Chicken, Cornish, Lamb and Veggie kabobs each time we have ordered and they all have been flavorful, juicy and cooked just perfect. The rice is a mixture of Tumeric and white basmati. It is cooked perfectly (no underdone pieces to crunch on while you are eating like in some places) and has a ton of flavor. I can't say enough about the bread other than you get a piece larger than your plate that is crispy and fluffy all in the same piece. The best of both worlds. You can't go wrong ordering from here.",1.0
"Former customer for hydrotherapy: 
This place is not professional in any way shape or form. 
I do not trust that she cleans every tube and keeps things hygienic (theres a jug that she used to use for chlorophyll, and its green and the tube is gunky, and apparently now she uses ozonated water, and yet that jug is still greenish and looks like its never been cleaned... 
Once there was a shit stain from another client before me on the private toilet in the room..... 
She gives very general suggestions to clients and yet she's not certified to give suggestions and nutritional advice is supposed to vary from person to person as we aren't all the same! She even tries to diagnose diseases when she is not qualified to do that!
She leaves the door open OFTEN while getting hydrotherapy done and once she encouraged some girl that worked there to solicit me with her aesthetic services...while i was laying on the colonic bed about to be treated!! 
Last time one of her very unprofessional massage ladies practically barged into the hydro room arguing with her about needing the get paid, again, while I'm getting a private treatment !!! 
She pushes too hard on intestines and sometimes it can really hurt and 
irritate the colon, and my partner actually got really hurt last time we went. 
Again, last time I went, she cut my session 20 minutes short without telling me, hoping I wouldn't figure it out? Because I was telling her I was feeling nauseous (which is normal if you have a sick gut), and I think she thought I might puke and didn't want to deal with it so she cut my session short and pretended like it was a full session....
I had previously asked her if we could pay by cheque next time because she wanted cash instead of debit to avoid fees on her end, and I told her it's way easier for us to pay by cheque, and she was hesitant, but I ended up convincing her, and she agreed that next time she would accept cheque from us. 
Next time comes around, we offer to pay via cheque, and she lies to my face and says she never accepts cheques and that it's cash only. 
At first we were like, it's cheap and gets the job done, why not?
Right?
No. 
Heck no. 
Value yourself, value your health, and spend a little more for a much, much better experience. 
She's not a mean lady, but she doesn't truly care about her clients, she's a hustler, just trying to make cash money, and I'm not trying to be rude, but I had to leave an honest review and say it exactly how it is.

***UPDATE***
I'm usually never on top of things the way I am with this, as I prefer to let karma 
work itself out, but I actually want to help people avoid wasting their time and money 
with crooked and dishonest people, so I feel it's my duty to speak out; 

The first time I went there I mentioned to her that she had horrid reviews online as I was about 
to cancel my first appointment with her for that reason, so my guess is she got a NEW website, for the SAME place, using a most likely FAKE new business address (if you google
the address nothing relevant comes up on google!!!) to FOOL people into thinking she's a new hydro spot, AND to start a new ""cover"" since ""Source de la Sante"" has gone to shit on google with all the horrendous (and very honest) reviews, and she wants to press ""reset""....
is that fair? What do you guys think?!
Which would explain that the one review this ""new"" place has, is a five star impeccable one, most probably plotted from her, as this person seems super sketch with no online activity except for writing this one review. 
I told you guys this woman is beyond crooked. 
Name of ""new"" business online on google: 
""Hydrotherapy Montreal"" 
And if you check out the source de la sante website and this new one, it has the same coupons and what not, AND if you go to ""contact us"" section of the new one, it actually has
the same address as Source de La Sante's....hmmm.....shocker. 
This new added info is for all you people already avoiding Source De La Sante, and 
for those who are simply looking to avoid dishonest hygienists whose license should 
be revoked for so may reasons, I think that included everyone in Montreal, locals and visitors 
alike.",1.0

"The restaurant is dimly lit and is very spacious -- it was a nice place to sit down for dinner. The waitress was nice, but the service overall was not up to par.

Her friendly demeanor made these things easy to brush off, but that is what is keeping this place from 5 stars.

Their beer list is short, but there are some decent options. The menu says to ask the server for beers on tap, so I am assuming they change it up often. There are plenty of interesting cocktails listed. We were pretty happy with the food. The calamari was solid, and we ordered a really good happy hour appetizer that I do not see on the menu now -- it was like a shrimp and avocado thin crust pizza, but the exact name of the dish is escaping me now.

She stated neither of those were true and that the insurance company covers it 100% through my comprehensive insurance.  She called progressive and I spoke to the agent.

"Okay, maybe I'm just a sucker for value but, man, is this place worth it. I usually order the chicken teriyaki with fried rice and vegetables (or just with extra vegetables and no rice if I'm feeling healthier) and it's always a struggle both to finish it because of the portion sizes and to not finish it because of how yummy it is.

Sometimes the wait is long because they make your food to order and because, I've noticed, they usually get large call-in orders. I also once got the vegetable tempura -- it tasted fine but, in terms of quantity, it wasn't really worth it at all. And I did try their sushi once; it was a little below average and took a very, very long time for them to make.

"I've been a very good customer at the Main Street Station casino in downtown Las Vegas for 20 years since they opened and currently an Emerald club member. 
A really unfortunate incident happened 4 days ago while my wife and I were at the casino. I was playing some Blackjack just before noon that day and at the time I was playing two hands with some green chips and I was playing before we were to meet my parents who have also been loyal customers for decades. My wife came down to meet my parents to go to lunch and I asked her to wait about 5 minutes as I was being dealt by a dealer I've known for years and Fria was about to go home within 5 minutes. 
I asked my wife to sit next to me for 5 minutes and I gave her a bunch of red chips I had accumulated. 
We played a total of two hands and was about to wager on the third when I was approached by a cocky casino floornan behind, Timmy who rudely said I couldn't play like that and there was some kind of regulation against this. 
Apparently, there's a policy there where one customer can only play up to two hands and because the person playing next to me is my wife, he counted it as we were playing on one 'Bankroll' although I gave her the stack of red chips which were in front of her. So, she was so embarrassed and we grabbed our chips and walked. 
I have bought in many times for $1000 and asked the dealer for $900 in green and $100 in red, and giving her the red stack. This was the first time I've ever heard of this rule and embarrassed there. So after lunch we drove to another property and stayed there complimentary at the Red Rock for 2 nights. 
During the course I did contact a really nice casino shift manager at the Main Street, Terry and he apologized and said if I ever encounter a problem like this again to contact the casino shift manager on duty. This situation was obviously not handled properly he said. 
I'm so amazed that this casino who I once thought prided itself with extending ALOHA to their Hawaiian guests would employ individuals with such poor customer service skills. 
Too bad as I still don't think this person's actions all reflect the entire staff of the Main Street Station casino at the Main Street Station.

"OK..from my pictures you'll very quickly notice it was my first time at dim sum. Note to self ordering two orders means a small sharing plate heaped with food not just two pieces like my boyfriend suggested...

-shrimp and chive dumplings, steamed and super light yet filling

"We actually contacted them as we were interested in a new system.  The guy that came to our house was knowledgable but did seem a little pushy when it came to the deal. We decided to go ahead and give it a try. We have had our system now for about a year and I must say in the beginning we were excited to have everything that we could control via the app. Things started pretty good then little by little we started having issues.  Many times the back door lock would show unlocked when it in fact was locked.  Then the front door.. then the video camera doorbell stopped working... then the garage door showed up when it was closed (and if you tried to close it, it was actually open the door).. what a nightmare!  Then the doorbell chime would not ring correctly.  They gave us a new one.. same problem!

Eggstacy gets the bump because of their food - however the rest of the experience left something to be desired. 

We went for the first time for Sunday brunch - around 11am and there was quite a wait for the larger groups. Luckily our table for 2 was ready in no time and my friend was seated by the time I finished parking and joined her. Then we sat for the next 10 minutes with no drinks or even waters and virtually ignored by all the staff busy bustling throughout. Now it was busy, no doubt about that, but I was really hoping for some water at least, it was a hot day! 

When the waitress did arrive, we were ready to put in our drink orders and she did bring us some much needed water. However, about 5 minutes later the waitress came back and asked me if I ordered the Apple Cider drink - which doesn't exist on the menu - and I clarified how I wanted the Boozie Iced Coffee. Another 10 minutes and both of our drinks were ready and we were onto the ordering. She again confused my friend's order and had to clarify, which I did appreciate as the wait was long and getting the wrong order for a Vegetarian would delay things quite a bit. Overall the waitress seemed really overwhelmed and confused throughout the day, which is unfortunate. 

Another thing - this place was full of families eating big meals together - but the music was some loud techno noise. I don't get it, the volume and the type of music did not go with the atmosphere or clientele at all. Very strange choice and was honestly distracting. This, paired with the waitress and waiting had us discussing how we'd likely not be back - unless the food was great. 

Well, the food arrived and it was AWESOME.  My ham and cheesy crepes were incredible and a portion so huge - 3 giant crepes filled with scrambled eggs, ham, and creamy cheese. My friend got a truffle butter brioche toast with asparagus and added mushrooms - it looked as good as it tasted. So in the end, we loved our food and the drinks were good too - always nice to have booze as an option. I would go back, just maybe not during the Sunday brunch rush - perhaps a weekday meal would be a better overall experience.",1.0

Let me just explain the process...you check in, fill out a waiver (don't freak out), then you put your items in a free locker. At that time, go to the bathroom before hand, then go back to the counter to get seated. You meet your server, they ask for any food allergies, hold each others shoulder then walk to your seat. The server helps you sit down, shows you with your hands where everything is on the table, and takes your drink order. They bring you all the courses, they cannot explain what you are eating until the end out of respect for the others eating. When you are done, they stand you up, hold each others shoulders then take you out to the room. I recommend bringing sunglasses to protect your eyes. Go get your locker stuff and check out. At that time, you can see what you were eating.

Tickets are priced a little high at about 24 bucks I think it was but since my daughter was free and it was really a trip here for her, I couldn't care too much.

There were large starfish, sharks, stingrays, fish and my daughters favorite was the giant sea turtle. She definitely got a kick out of that!

"I have come to Krazy Sushi several times since my first review and have realized service and food quality is hit or miss... depending on the time of day and who the server is... I have sat at the sushi bar as a single patron and practically get ignored. Every time I ordered while at the bar, I felt like an inconvenience. I even tried to strike up small talk but got quickly ignored. Most of the servers at the tables are good, especially during lunch. My wife and I came for dinner one time and had the waitress argue with us as to what came on a specific roll... We have been many times in the last year (I think I completed 3 loyalty cards).. so I am familiar with what is normally on their rolls. My wife has a few favorites and they threw extras that didn't belong... the general good quality is good, and with it being so close, I will continue to go... but the initial amazement is gone...",0.0

Come for lunch and enjoy a delicious pulled pork sandwich ($6.50) with your choice of BBQ sauce, paired with some delicious cider from the cider house & wine cellar. We had the blueberry cider and honey cider. Both were very sweet and very refreshing. I would recommend the blueberry if you enjoy fruity drinks- you can definitely taste the fresh blueberry flavor and it has just the right amount of sweetness. We also bought a ginger cider growler to go. The cider is very expensive ($6-$7) considering how small the plastic cups are, so it might be more worth it to buy a growler ($22) to share with friends if you all enjoy the same flavor. They give samples if you want to try any. 

There are a lot of ice cream flavors to pick from, and they even have dole soft serve for people who are lactose intolerant. 

There is a large garden center if you would like to bring home some plants.

Very kid friendly- lots of things for kids to play on, plus a petting zoo!

We loved the gift barn- they carry so many special things that would make great gifts. We purchased two little pots of honey for $6 each. The ladies working inside are the nicest and will help you with anything you need!

"Dr Carla Turner is the BEST gyno doctor in town! She has an excellent bedside manner, superb surgical skills, and truly shows that she cares about her patients. Because she is so good at her profession, she is a very busy doctor. BUT, that doesn't stop her from being professional, courteous, caring, a superb listener and very considerate when it's your appointment time. The apple doesn't fall far from the tree because her front office staff also reflect friendly superb customer service skills each and every visit. Sadly, I am not fond of Dr Miller or any of the others they hire as midwives. I've seen them before because Dr Turner was booked out, but I'm sorry, they just don't compare AT ALL to Dr. Carla Turner! I've even begun scheduling far out, just to ensure I only see Dr Carla Turner. She's worth the wait! And I've now entrusted her to see my daughter too. You are loved, respected and appreciated Dr Turner! Front office staff too! Thank you for all you do!",0.0

"Moved from Asheville when I was 15 to the westside of Charlotte. Very familiar with the auto shop and the VW on the roof.  34 years ago I moved to the next county over. That and the fact that I worked in food service was not a good incentive to go out of my way to dine. I am retired now and looking forward to trying all these good eats I have heard about over the years. Top of my list was Pinkey's which is located in the old auto shop and the VW is still on the roof.   

I was not disappointed. My shrimp was lightly breaded and I loved, loved, loved the tartar sauce. The onions rings were like the beer battered ones I make at home, thin and lightly breaded. The chili on the waffle fries was like what my Dad made, just all meat good chili. A friend ordered the corn dog shrimp which he gobbled up. What I am telling you is everything tasted like someone cared. 

Service was excellent. Stephanie the manager of the day was so friendly and very attentive. Everyone took the time to be gracious. Now that being said, this was on a Monday evening at 6:00.  I know things will get crazy when they are slammed. But the food and the atmosphere are worth it. And remember that it takes time to make food handmade. Don't be in a hurry for good food someone cared about before it got to you.

"A close friend recommended this venue to us and we are so glad she did. We are so impressed by everyone and everything at Wedgewood. They really do take the stress out of your wedding planning. That's one of the biggest things we loved about them. We met with Jacquelyn, Lindsey, and Sarah throughout the planning. They were so wonderful with all our planning and details. We then met with Ann for our flower arrangements. She was amazing!! Also with our ideas and colors. She brought our vision to life and then some. She found colors she said were hard to come by. She turned their wedding chapel into an elegant wedding dream. It was unrecognizable once she was through with it. Truly breathtaking. Her reception flower arrangements with LED lights were so gorgeous!! And she went all out with our sweetheart table. 100% satisfied. Their photography vender; Steven and Janelle were so fun to work with. They made our time relaxing and enjoyable. At the rehearsal, Sarah was pleasant and professional. She directed the rehearsal and made sure we were good with the final. And then there is DJ Murphy. What an awesome guy! At the rehearsal, he was very thorough with our planning. He's was a big part of our special day, and he gets the details down! If you can't think of music, he has plenty of suggestions. He guided us through the night so that our experience was easy and fun for everyone. Jacquelyn, Lindsey, and Sarah were there the whole night coordinating and keeping things on point. The food at our reception was soo delicious. We had a tasting at an open house and decided on most of our dishes. Their menu is great. Several options. We went with Filet and Salmon.One of the best wedding dishes ever! The Salmon with light drizzle was scrumptious. Patty, the top chef even came out, introduced herself, and congratulated us. She made sure everything was to our satisfaction. Our wedding day was absolutely everything we wanted and then some. Everything was so beautiful and went as planned. Most importantly..STRESS FREE! They handle everything for you. 10 GOLD STARS!!!!!! Thank you everyone at Wedgewood.  You truly made our day memorable.",0.0

"Capriottis sandwiches are great.  The staff at this location - on the day I was there - awful. Instead of enjoying my food I'm typing this review that's how annoyed I am.

Walked in and the open wasn't lit so I let them know. The two of them laughed and then did nothing... it's still off.

In spite of saying the food was for here they give me the sandwiches as to go with no tray to eat on.  When I go back to ask for a tray you would think I just told them to break the law.

Then we open the sandwiches and they got the majority of our order wrong. Their remedy when confronted - just hand me the missing tomatoes to put on myself.  Am i capable of that - yes.  Did I pay them to then make my own sandwich - absolutely not.

"Having lived in Thailand and worked for the Thai Government here in the States, its fair to say I've eaten my fair share of US based Thai food. I decided based on some reviews that I would try Awawan Thai in Las Vegas. As others have described the area, it's located in a sketchy -- an unattractive strip mall sandwiched in between the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. I mean we ain't talking the Bellagio - I would encourage those with NV carry permits to do so .

Inside the restaurant the decor is a lot better than the area deserves. As I scanned the menu  and looked at prices (which I've found has little to do with how well Thai food is prepared) I couldn't help think what in the hell are they putting in here? Gold flakes?  I mean $16 for a simple chicken penang curry??  Four pieces of chicken satay for $11? And a VERY salty chinese brocolli and crispy pork belly for another 15 bones thank you very much.  WOW. Penang was decently flavorful with the proper spices but the sauce was thin and bland - despite being ordered ""phet"" aka spicy (I do speak Thai flunetly so there should have been no misunderstanding). To add insult to injury to this staple of Thai cuisine, the some of chicken pieces (breast meat at least) appeared to be undercooked and chewy.  The four miserly satay skewers were mostly ok but the little glass thimble (about half the size of an ordinary shot glass) of peanut sauce was barely enough to cover one piece. We finally were able to get more after asking twice. Charging for steamed rice seems all the rage these days with Arawan following suit. No problem with an establishment making money, but $2 a peice for small bowl of rice per PERSON seems a tad excessive.

Bottom line, for this overpriced place, the dishes should have been without compromise - not poorly prepared Americanized psuedo-Thai food.. Save your money for the slots where you might have better chance of getting something back for your money.",0.0

"We walked in and were embraced with warm and delicious aromas. I ordered the Le petite italienne (goat cheese, arugula, prosciutto, & sundried tomatoes) and my husband ordered the Westmount (with duck confit, mushrooms, caramelized onions) They would have been perfect but they were so salty I couldn't finish mine. We both left disappointed. The salty flavour was from prosciutto ham and the duck and needed balancing with something else...I lived in Paris for 2 years and had some of the best galettes and crepes. Great ambience and good gluten free options but reduce the sodium content please! We'll give it another try for the crepes desserts.",0.0
Tried this Cha Chaan Teng for lunch my first dish has go to be the baked pork chop In tomato sauce if they do it well then probably the chef has the right stuff if you know what I mean.

Cozy atmosphere. Staff seems friendly; our waiter was attentive and warm. The guacamole appetizer was very flavorful and the orange added a nice and unique twist.

"This place is supposed to be a hall of fame. I expected a lot more than what I saw. The ground floor is where most of the stuff is. I thought this was the beginning of a great hall of fame. There's outfits and other props to see. The rest of the building is about 5 floors of wasted space. I thought they'd have plaques of inductees. I was wrong. There was one tiny piece on Prince, about three Michael Jackson outfits, one tiny piece on Tupac. I understand they depend on donations from the artists. Still, they should do a better job of presenting the artists that are in the hall of fame. It's overpriced for the experience you get. This place is not worthy of being called a hall of fame. The building is nice though.",0.0
Sort of non de script food served here. They had plenty of beers on tap from that perspective you could certainly find something. The food is about the same as chilis or TGI Fridays.

Super Arzon is a Persian grocery store that offers fresh authentic Persian food made on the other side of the shop. I went with my best friend who is half Persian, and she did all the ordering. They grill all the kabobs once you place in a order, which makes it very fresh. I ordered the Vaziri combo, which has one beef and one chicken kabobs on top of basmati rice, with a grilled tomato on the side. My friend got Koobideh, which included two beef kabobs on top of basmati rice and a grilled tomato on the side.

Worst experience ever went here last nite ordered one large sprite get to the window and the cashier told me the drink was $10 five times...finally after she realized that all I had was one drink she told me how she know the board says it's $1 but the manager changed the price...clearly that's false advertising and I wasn't having that everything about this was all wrong aside from me spending 20 min unable to get out of the drive thru the negative attitude from the cashier and the rude manager the soda was just ok... never going back late nite crew is the worst!!!!!!,0.0

"This place is awesome! I'm from Cleveland, OH (where Lebron is) and was in Toronto for work. After a quick Google search for ""Browns Backer Bar"", I found Shoxs was the largest Cleveland Browns bar in the Toronto area. Drinks were cheap and the food (buffalo wings) was excellent! The owner was the first to greet us and kindly showed us to the back room of the bar, which was filled with all the Browns propaganda and memorabilia a true Cleveland fan could hope for. The crowd was great and it felt like I was back at home cheering on the Browns to the first of many victories (even if only preseason). Will happily send all of my Cleveland friends who visit Toronto to Shoxs!",0.0
This is probably my favorite place on mill or anywhere. It's a restaurant\/bar\/karaoke bar so you've got many options here.

Yes, they offer ridiculously, glutton sized portions but for the cost, poor food quality and subpar service, you're really better off going somewhere else as Vegas offers way too many other options to end up settling for this place.",0.0

"I assume there are others like me who are in business for themselves and have to travel, therefore have to manage their travel budget carefully.  Extended stay properties such as InTown Suites can be useful and even necessary for this purpose (averaging $50 per night for a minimum 7 day stay, less than even a Budget or Days Inn).  Most of the folks that stay at this property, however, actually seem to be using it as an open-ended residence, perhaps taking advantage of the no-lease, no credit check policy, which goes with the territory.  Regardless of which category you fall into, here are a few survival tips.

The rooms are decent but small; the trick is to spend as little time there as possible.  There aren't really full kitchens, as advertised, but there's a range, sink, microwave and refrigerator, so close enough. (What's missing is anything resembling a store in the area from which to procure ingredients.  I got provisions from Dean and Deluca and Grab a Green uptown, and brought home lots of leftovers.). Housekeeping is once a week, so you may want to get your own cleaning supplies.  There is no shampoo, hair dryer, iron, coffee maker (!), dishware, etc.  I had to go out an buy some of these items, but unlike me, you can come prepared.

Pluses include premium cable and pretty reliable WiFi.

The area is not particularly pedestrian friendly, but I figured out how to walk to three great spots without too many life-endangering dashes across roads or trips through weedy lots - the historic Old Mecklenburg Brewery, the fun Queen Park Social, and the cool distillery Broken Spoke. (Since neither my permanent housing NOR my office were ready, each of these functioned as temporary workspaces for me, as well as sources of much needed alcohol :))

The light rail is also in reasonable walking distance. (Woodlawn is closer, but Scaleybark has more sidewalks and fewer truck that want to run you over. Ticket machines are perpetually in and out of service so get the app.)

The immediate area is a little shady, mostly due to the massive Studio 6 next door. (If you don't know what Studio 6 is, I didn't either, but I think I figured it out--it's a ""de-flagged"" Motel 6, which means it wasn't up to brand standards, so draw your own conclusions!) I had a bad incident walking at night, so the moral of the story is, don't walk around at night, ladies!

On the corner is also McDonald's ... home of the angriest minimum wage workers in the South.  Bring your credit card as they will randomly refuse to give you change for cash. (Not everyone, sometimes just you.)

And please don't move your family here; the 200 sq ft rooms and various characters loitering in the stairwells do not make this property conducive to raising children, so don't be that parent!

"I'm so disappointed in this place. This has been our family restaurant since it's been opened. Was waiting to order for 18 mins, tried to get our waiters attention every time he passed. Finally came to our table at 6:08 & my mother said we would like to order from the happy hour menu. Our waiter who was an older gentleman aged  50-60 turned to my mother and blatantly told her No. it was passed 6 o clock and if you don't like it you can speak to my manager. Are you kidding me!?? What terrible customer service!!! Not I'm sorry you're past the time even if we had been waiting there 18 mins! Than the manager came over basically calling me a liar that I haven't been there that long...I even showed him the time I texted my mother I was here and she was right around the corner at 5:45!! Disgusted!!! Manager told us no at first and than said maybe I can manually do it.. I've worked for this Applebee's before & I've been coming here for decades & to be treated like they could give a shit about their customers is beyond me... not to worry I will have no problem driving 20 mins out of my way to be treated with respect. It's not the fact of saving money for happy hour, like what's the big deal just pay full price?? It's the fact that we as your customers pay your bills. I notice when my server is  having a bad day but they still try & I give them the benefit of the doubt but to treat my mother and I like that is disgusting. Chao Applebee's on Nellie and Stewart!

I took my car here, twice. Both times I asked for service on certain things and straight-up didn't receive it. It wasn't like they charged me for anything they didn't do, but they just seemed to be more about getting the car in and out the door instead of doing what I asked. 

The first time I just wanted the 50,000 mile service, y'know the deal in the owner's manual. Well, they pretty much just changed the oil and even left a dirty air filter in. I figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt since it was a (maybe) busy Friday and plus, they're walking distance from my house; so, I gave them another shot. The second time, I came in with a 3x5 card detailing everything I wanted done and made sure the fella understood, as I was going driving cross-country. He said it'd all be done (This was the 57,000 mile thing) and apologized for leaving a dirty air filter in the time prior, that he'd fix it. He did for free, which was nice.

Anyway, an hour and a half later I got a call that they were finished. The mechanic said he looked at a lot of stuff himself, but some other guys did stuff on my list and checked off what they did and put it in the car. When I got the list, only one thing was checked and they even put ""N\/A"" next to ""check fuel filter"". Were they saying the car had no fuel filter? Because it does and I'm not getting why it couldn't be checked. What about the other items?

Again, they didn't charge me for anything they didn't do; at least I don't think so, as it was like $70... but I'm just not sure what they didn't do (did they have time to rotate the tires, or?...et cetera). I didn't say a limit on how much I wanted to spend and I was willing to wait all day for the car to be done, so I just don't understand. It's a weird place, and I'm not into it.

On the less than positive side, the prices really are a bit steep, and there are single specials without a standard happy hour so it won't necessarily be the spot to go for a long evening of affordable food and drink.

The Kale Caesar dressing is quite possibly the best I've had and I love that they threw some chickpeas, avocado, tempeh and grape tomatoes in there to keep things interesting. The coconut whipped cream on the parfaits is super thick and creamy. My only 'beef' with this place is that it's pretty expensive. Also, there's nowhere to sit and eat.

2. Dry meat is harder to eat when you're given very little sauce! Not to mention the sauce was watered down and had the viscosity of water.

We visited Copacabana on a Sunday night around 8pm and they were quite packed but It took us not too long to get a table since we had booked a table before hand (make sure to rsvp before showing up!!).

I wasn't a big fan of the hot buffet nor the salad bar; nothing really stood out. The hot buffet offered a selection of carbs (mashed potato, bread, rice, pasta) while the salad bar had too many options of heavy salads. It would have been nice to have some lighter salad choices. The chimichurri sauce was my favourite out of all the buffet selection. 

The meat was really the star of the night. As soon as we sat down, we were overwhelmed by the amount of servers stopping by us to serve us.

My only complaints are that most of the employees are quite snobby and inattentive (some, however, are great), and that the restrooms are gross. Oh and sometimes it smells like feces when going through the bins. I definitely recommend gloves or sanitizer of some sort. I usually just go for the furniture though.",0.0

"Wow. Just left this place without service. Snobby, rude. Half the restaurant was empty and the waiter had the nerve to say we picked ""too large of a table for our four person party"". We sat at a table for 6. Relax. You're restaurant isn't busy at the moment anyways.",0.0
"Not bad, but not really Mexican either. The chicken had a ton of rosemary on it, and while the beef was nice and tender, it didn't have any real mexican flavor either. Prices were fine, service was friendly, and the rest of the condiments were all nice and fresh, but overall a bit bland for my taste. If I lived, worked, or studied nearby I'd probably stop by occasionally, but probably not worth a special trip if you're not already nearby.",0.0

"I've been wanting to try this place since it opened and finally got the chance to last night. We made a reservation a few days before, which I think was the right move. The place was packed when we got there, and stayed busy the whole time. The atmosphere is great! The restaurant itself is huge, and the dining room is lively yet feels homey.

We started off with an order of fresh baked bread, which was warm and delicious. For my entree, I had the spaghetti al limone, which was shrimp and caviar in a lemon cream sauce.The lemon  sauce had a great flavor without being overpowering, and there was tons of shrimp and caviar too. I do wish there was something in there such as herbs or a vegetable that brightened it up a bit, but I still enjoyed it a lot. I also got to sample some of the gnocchi and meatballs which were delicious (and I would probably order this next time instead).  

My only complaint was that service was pretty slow the entire night. It took us a while to get our entrees and our bill. Understandably it was very busy, but I think they could have done a little better on that part. Still, our waitress was friendly and great at explaining the menu. I will be back for sure!",0.0

"This grocery is an ok place to shop. I can say that I am at the grocery store a lot during the week so I have some pretty high standards when it comes to shopping at them. I do give them praise for their selection and price. I always know that if I want great organic food, this is the place if Festival Foods doesn't have it. This store is very big so they have all different cuisines and variety throughout the store. Their liquor department is very big with a ton of options. Their prices are a bit cheaper on things compared to Metcalf's and other high end grocery stores. 

The few downsides to this store are the parking lot, the tiled floor and the very slow checkout lanes. The parking lot is gigantic but the lanes are very small and people are constantly flying through the lot. There are many other businesses around it as well so it makes it very congested most of the day. 

I know complaining about the tile on the floor is reaching for a complaint for some but this is literally the loudest store. I get a headache every time I go in. The carts rumbling makes everyone have to scream over each other to hear, which then makes it very loud. You would think that just a few sections would be tiled, but it is the whole store from what I can tell. If you have glass bottles in your cart make sure to hold onto them or they fall and bounce around while walking through this store. 

The checkout has gotten a bit better because of them installing a lot more self checkout lanes and the new electronic scanning machines. I usually plan about an hour and a half or more for my whole trip considering the checkout area is always very busy. The checkout employees are usually quiet and never say much. 

When it comes to customer service I have never been greatly impacted by an employee being great. When I have trouble finding something I always try and ask before roaming the whole store wondering where something is located. When I ask an employee they usually either say they do not know or they will point me in a direction and let me fend for myself. On multiple occasions I have roamed the store after asking an associate and have been upset because I couldn't find the item I was looking for. Overall I would avoid this store if you are on a tight schedule or do not want the headache of the mad rush of people. There are a lot of better options when it comes to grocery stores in my opinion.",0.0

"Stopped by for Saturday morning breakfast with my husband and 3 year old son. The server was very nice and friendly, but didn't know the menu well. My husband and I ended up getting The Delight omelette and our son got a pancake with eggs and sausage. The food was fairly generic; reminded me of the cafeteria food at work. My omelette was modified a bit (mushrooms instead of tomatoes) and ended up giving me food poisoning, so it was definitely not a ""delight""; my son complained all day about his little belly hurting. The three of us ate for less than $25, but would've honestly been better off grabbing breakfast at McDonald's. I can say with 100% certainty that we will not be back...there are far too many other tasty, locally-sourced options in the area to settle for this place.",0.0

So many of friends have recommended Dr. Shah to me so for my second pregnancy I decided to go to him. He is as good as I was told! The office is clean and staff is super friendly!

Dr. Shah takes his time with me and answers any questions I have. Usually my appointments last 30 minutes and about an hour if I have an ultrasound. I love that they do in house blood work if needed. Check out is also fast. I still haven't delivered my baby but I will update when I do.,0.0
I have been going to Dillard's for many years for my make up.  I have bought other items but choose to shop elsewhere as Dillard's is a tad out of my pricing although I did like their leather jackets until the one I bought in 2014. I couldn't even had it repaired due to where both pockets came apart. I'm not complaining of their products but I was completely insulted on my treatment. Never in my life have I been treated so disrespectfully. I assumed it was because I broke my arm and was in a sling and just couldn't put my makeup on. However I can assure Dillard's my business will be elsewhere!,0.0

"Location: Right by Dupont subway station. There are some paid parking nearby.

Price: Overall, it came down to around $25\/person after ordering appetizers, tacos\/burritos, and alcoholic drinks. 

Food: The fried baha fish tacos were delicious! The batter is thin and super crispy, but not oozing grease. I'd say this is a must-get, especially if you're pain-avoidant and can't handle spice. The octopus tacos were very tender, yet charred just enough for the flavour to be strong. It's on the spicy side though, but you can ask for the non-spice version. Their home-made nachos were thick and crispy. They also offer sugar-cane Coca cola if you want to avoid high fructose corn syrup drinks. The burrito was gigantic and covered in sauce and veggies.

"Today is our last day here at the Monte Carlo. We had purchased a Southwest Vacation Package, and this hotel was one of our choices. We went moderate priced since we here such a short time, but man, I won't be doing that again.  Something I expect and I can live with. Such as a long line to check in, etc.  The front desk staff was friendly, but I feel that they are obliged to leave details out of what is going on at the hotel.  No pool, construction.  Our room was missing chairs to sit in. No coffee or mini fridge, pretty much a tv and a bed.  While I understand that the hotel is renovating, they are obligated to let their guests know before they arrive, what is happening at the hotel.  You can't call it a resort.  It's more like a hi-rise travel lodge.  Very disappointed, and it was my first time to Las Vegas ever.  I don't know if it's worth coming back for mediocrity, and bad tasting food. And add more $5 tables.  You'd have more people sitting in them.

Service has improved, though I went at a time when it wasn't busy at all. While I no longer needed to gulp down an entire fish tank, I still needed several glasses of water to go with my samosas and curry. Their spiciness level is not for the faint of heart and stomach. The mango lassi now has an overwhelming amount of rose water. Would I go back again? Probably not, but I'm giving an additional star for their attempt at elevating Indian cuisine.",0.0

"On Friday October 13th at the Benedum. The fat lady sang, jumped to her death and it was curtains for Cosca and the show.  The show was truly over only when the fat lady sang which left all 4 of the main characters dead. What a brilliant show!  

The ending wouldn't suggest that The first Act was more comedic than dramatic.  At times, hilarious as the jealous Cosca became increasingly irate of the beautiful woman her lover Mario is painting (Mary Magdalene - see 1st pic posted) lol & Scarpio's jealously of Mario is at first funny.  Funnier when he starts torturing and threatening to lap of heads (you can hear Mario's friend screaming out off stage through the torture chamber door..singing his torture in a classic beautiful Opera way.  I thought this was extremely cool, brilliant (almost funny...because you don't expect to hear screaming in terror sung in key) and the actor is off stage right singing this scream.  I loved that.  Imagine a beautiful Opera voice cry Instead of  ""Arggghha ahhladffuki'mmmmbeinnnmurderrredd""

The set is in a church with the Mary Magdalene painting on an eisel and a church door to the cathedral audience.  center of the stage.  The second set is also in a church with a center door to the larger Cathedral chapel (you can hear a choir singing off stage and the acoustics are made to sound like it's coming from that door and\/or the set design has that easy to believe.  Check out the video I postEd. Loved that.  very cool.  who designed that?  exceptional.  

Cosca's character cycles through a broad spectrum of emotions from jealous, loyal, venegeful, and religious and moral at the end before she jumps to her deAth while singing "" I will now be judged before God with you..you bastard Scorpio"".  Is this all about her and Scorpio ?  Is she a sociopath too?  what about the poor artist Mario who got caught up in all of this?  Did he deserve to die?  maybe, but shouldn't she be calling out for his love before vengeance witn Scarpio?  Hmmm...a peak into her true character here.  But Leah Crocetto's acting & beautiful singing have the audience believing her to be more of a jealous & funny character who is chasing an artist who feels trapped in the situation and is staying with her to survive.  Sure there are different interpretations of Cosca and this one is a believable one. And Compassion grows for Cosca despite her flaws as the futility of the situation becomes evident.  And her singing is so beautiful!  Gives the audience no choice but to fall in love with her despite her character flaws. Is this an observation of life and the character flaw exceptions we make for athletes, beautiful actresses, and the extremely wealthy?  

In the end, the fake execution for Mario was real.  The Power mongering and heartless Scarpio has been murdered, killed by Cosca.  And her lover is dead, victim of a ""fake execution"".  Her choice to believe the sociopath she murdered (who's fault is that?) is a poor one.  This Opera is going GOT on us...and Cosca, true to the words we all know ""Elivs has left the building"" or I mean it aint over until the fat lady sings"" as she falls to her death..exit stage center down!  

Bravo, fricking loved this Opera!  2 Thumbs way up!

Lastly, trying to research the origin of ""It's not over to the fat lady sings...I found this and thought I hope that it is true.  Great legend...and I'm having a change of heart about Al Capone.  Opera can move an audience in mysterious ways..

Fwd...(from a bloke in Dublin) The way I heard it was that in the twenties Al Capone developed a taste for opera, mugging up assiduously on recordings, and one night went to a live performance of Tosca, accompanied by two bodyguards. These gents, who hadn't done the same homework as Al, got up to go at the end of the first aria, only for Al to drag them back into their seats, snarling ... you guessed it.

"Downtown for First Friday and was meeting friends at Desoto. I ordered from Adobo because they had an interesting menu. They were having a happy hour for First Friday so I ordered a bao. Had no idea what that was but when I asked the server said the veggie version was vegan. Ordered it and it was so good. It was a mini sandwich with saut√©ed veggies and mushrooms. The veggies were really well seasoned and the best part was the sandwich bread was steamed. It was puffy and light and the sandwich tasted super fresh. The restaurant is in an in door marketplace and you order at the counter. It's like a fancy food court. There is seating inside, outside and inside there are two levels of seating. This is a great spot for meeting up with a large groups and if people have different things they want to want to eat. When I came it was busier than usual because there was also a crafts market going on. They had jewelry, clothes, and stalls selling baklava to support Syrian refugees. I really liked the bao and I got my food pretty quickly. Recommend trying bao!",0.0

"This is a new cheesecake shop in Cours Mont Royal under path. I saw a line up a few days ago and I thought I would try it later. The menu is simple. They have only 3 types: cheesecake, cheese tart, and matcha cheesecake. 

I have no previous information to rely on, so I just ordered a cheesecake. It's a lot smaller than I expected. The entire cheesecake fits my hand. The texture is very fluffy and light. I am not a huge fan of cheesecake but I remember that a typical cheesecake is a lot heavier and thicker in terms of texture. I think they add a lot of eggs to make the texture fluffy. However, the taste is not amazing for $10. I recommend this just to give it a try, but I am not sure if I would be a regular customer.",0.0
"Stopped in on Friday July 7 11:15 am. 

I was seated by the window overlooking an outside patio. The waitress promptly asked what I was drinking and brought it over while I was at the buffet. 

This was my first time trying the lunch buffet. 

I decided to take a spoonful of a variety of items. I very much dislike wasting food if I don't like the flavor.

I decided to start with the Asian station. I had some fried rice, shrimp lomein, orange chicken, a spring roll, dumpling, and a couple Asian bbq drumette.

The fried rice didn't have very much flavor and the rice was dry. By dry I mean it didn't taste like it had been fried in some oil in a wok but had been done on maybe something like a griddle. This didn't embed the traditional stir fry flavor into the actual rice.

The shrimp lomein & the orange chicken tasted like something the average person whips up in their home, when they attempt to make them at home and utterly fail. Considering a casino has access to the best cooking equipment, and quite a few chefs or sous chefs they should be easily rocking any Asian dish.

I liked the taste and size of the spring rolls. They were about 1\/2 the normal thickness of a traditional spring roll and much longer. 
  The Asian dumpling was horrid, and I mean horrid. I recommend you find a different recipe immediately. The worst I have ever eaten, even over every boxed one I have tried. At least do a blind taste test with 10-15 people and I am sure you will get the same answer. 
  The Asian bbq drumette were fantastic. They were perfectly cooked, had just the right amount of sauce on them and had an excellent light crispness to them. Perfect score with these.

I next tried the meat station and immediate area foods. 
  I had the mashed potatoes and they were killer. They weren't to thick or to runny, they had a good salt ratio, and tasted like they had some sour cream or buttermilk in them. 
  I tried the fried cod, roasted turkey, roast beef, and some kettle chips. 
  The turkey was moist but lacked any spice or added flavor. It was very very much plain turkey flavor. I recommend some butter, lemon added under the skin. 
  The beef was pretty good. Also nice and moist. 
  The fried cod was tender, but the batter was extremely greasy. 
  The tartar sauce was fairly runny. I think it could have used a little more relish and thicker.
Kettle chips were pretty good. 

  I tried some of the ravioli in marinara sauce and it was on the chewy side. Decent flavor though. 

  I tried the shrimp fajita. I prefer grilled shrimp in a shrimp fajita, thus was more like a stewed shrimp fajita combination. Decent flavor, just not to my preference is all. 
  I tried the carne asada quesadilla. Decent flavor. 

  I tried some of the honey smoked salmon. This one is very hard to describe if you haven't ever tasted something like this. While the salmon was moist and the smoke flavor pretty good, it had this weird back flavor to it. Something like the smell of a sterno burner or gas smell embedded into it. Could have been a fluke, not sure. 

While they had a decent assortment of food for sure, many of the dishes felt like they tasted like something someone tries to cook at home, when they really want the flavor of a good restaurant food. In my opinion many of the recipes need reviewed and tweaked to actually taste like something you would be eating out at the restaurant. You have tons of cooks and chefs working for you. Let them All experiment or bring replacement recipes to you. I am sure they can come up with some fine tweaks. 

The waitress was very attentive and always looking to make sure I was doing OK or if I needed something.

Pretty good price for the lunch buffet. However, I prefer the assortment and flavor of the dishes at a very nearby casino. I might try the buffet here on a different day or later in the year to see if something changes. But for now I will stick with the other casino buffet. 

This review is based on my personal taste preferences, and I know each person is different. However, that Asian dumpling is an immediate get rid of item and get a new recipe completely different than what you have.

Overall a slightly less than average meal. Nothing stood out I ate as fabulous, except the drumettes and mashed potatoes.",0.0

"UPDATE! : This review was left while we waited. I've only moved it up another star based on my experience with the manager. I completely do understand, but my girlfriend sent her food back to the kitchen and part of the order was not correct or forgotten. I've never seen my girlfriend angry cry, but tonight was a first. We are thankful to the manager we spoke to and took care of us, but the two hour wait and the constant mess up along with the food that came out the kitchen that was unforgiving was what had it for the experience.

I love sitting at the bar, and every sushi restaurant I have ever been to, you can order from the bar. That's why I sit at the bar, so you can order the moment you're ready to eat again, and not wait on the waitress. Also, they seem to be understaffed every time I go there. Their menu is set up in a strange way, and it was confusing at first to read. I've been there a few times with my husband now, and I can navigate it a little better, but otherwise if my husband didn't like this place and it wasn't closer to home than my favorite sushi places, I probably wouldn't ever go here again.",0.0

"Another BYOB Indian restaurant but this time in a more ""¬†elegant¬†"" dining setting. More expensive then all the other Indian restaurants that I go to (perhaps rent is ridiculously expensive in St Lambert) I personally don't know if I like it or not. We chose vegetarian table d'h√¥te for two and to be honest it was bad. It was just not that good either. Ok. Ok. This is just MY opinion (I grew up and work in the restaurant business). So here's my problem. All three main dishes seems to have the same base sauce that has been tweaked with by the addition of different spices for each of them. The texture of the sauce (that's what gave it up) is exactly the same as those bottles Indian sauces that you buy at the grocery store. Like it has been thicken with some sort of commercial emulsifier. It felt like they had tubs of it in the back. Something wasn't right. Another thing is that it wasn't spicy at all! We had to ask for hot sauce. Probable because the place is in St Lambert and they try to cater to the clients taste buds. Americanized menu?? I think so. Another thing is that I could taste the fake powdered chicken bouillon in the food. Everything seemed to be on the sweet side as well. Like I said, not bad but not good at all. Not worth the price. I guess it's like the Chez Lien but Indian version.

"I wish I could give this hotel zero stars. I can't tell you how unbelievably unhappy I was with my stay here. First of all if you are a guest at the hotel you should not have to pay for parking. Its a slap in the face to pay for parking after already paying for an overpriced sub par hotel room. Hotels are designed to keep you in so you spend more money at their casino but the Linq went way overboard with it. Our room was nearly impossible to find with hallways that led nowhere, escalators that went up to dead ends, and nobody around to help us. I didn't know weather I was at a hotel in Vegas or the Winchester mystery house. Just getting to our room took a half hour because of all the guessing and unclear signs mixed with getting on wrong elevators that had a wait time of ten minutes and when one would come it was too packed to get on. We were so annoyed by the morning due to the constant humming of what I could only assume was the air conditioner that we just wanted to leave. Checking out was equally as bad of an experience. Learning from our previous elevator wait we decided to just take the stairs to get to the lobby, BIG MISTAKE the stairs that we could find took us all the way outside in some discussing alleyway on the side of the hotel, quite a distance from the lobby in the heat carrying all of our luggage. There were many more issues at this hotel but this review is getting too long. As you can probably tell I will never stay at this hotel again until they fix these major issues.",0.0
"Consider yourself warned: everything is fine unless you elect to redeem some coupons here.

"Came here with two of my coworkers for lunch today. We got there a few minutes after they opened so the wait time wasn't bad at all! Near the end it did get rather busy so I suggest the earlier the better. Our waitress was great! Very nice and informative, even convinced us to try to margaritas! I got the coconut margaritas and my other coworker got a prickly pear. Mine was nice and smooth great taste! The prickly pear was a bit too sweet for my liking but still really good. We both agreed that they were not strong at all. We usually feel a bit fuzzy after one Margarita and these didn't do that to us. Still really good though. 
Food came out rather fast. Again this might be because we got there pretty early before the rush. Everything looked great. I got 3 of their street tacos. One standard, one Carne Asada, and one pork.

"Great ambiance and fun cocktails. The Bennett and bubbles was perfectly refreshing for a hot Arizona night. In terms of food, we tried the Brussels sprouts, braised beef tacos, and macaroni and cheese with chicken and broccoli (that selection was based previous reviews). I wasn't extremely impressed with the macaroni, maybe the reviews hyped it up too much. The tacos were great, slightly more on the spicy side. The brussel sprouts were good with good flavor, but could have been more crispy. Overall, I'd give the food a three, and the ambiance a four. Feel free to give it a try and make your own opinion, enjoy!",0.0
"Great hotel! From the minute we walked I  we were treated so well. The staff has clearly been trained and they do a fantastic job. From the front desk clerks to housekeeping you can see that they care about their guests a d do everything they can to make your stay a hospitable one. The room was very clean and fairly updated. Lots of tv channels, ergonomical desk chair, super comfy bed, higher end sheets, lots of towels, keurig and k cups, mini fridge, microwave...I mean, everything you could want and need (except no safe ). We would gladly refer friends and family here when visiting.",0.0
"So convenient!! If you need a phone repaired ASAP, they can get it done as soon as one hour and they come to you. My daughter cracked the screen of her iPhone 6 so badly that it would no longer function. We were going to spend the money to upgrade to another phone, but didn't think it was worth it considering my daughter is accident prone.  They charged a flat fee for the screen replacement (and I had a coupon code for $10 off, even better!) and the cost was reasonably priced considering the convenience of them being mobile. The website to schedule the repair is user friendly. You schedule the repair, receive and email confirmation, then the technician texts\/emails when they are en route. Our technician showed up in expected time frame, and 20 minutes later the screen was restored and the phone functioning as nothing ever happened. I will definitely recommend and use them again if I have to (hopefully not :)",0.0

I also ordered the pork buns at $2.00 each (high price)- they only had frozen ones, no fresh ones at the time. The glutinous rice\/black eyed peas dessert with coconut was good- the portions were smaller then I normally observe from other places and the price a little higher $2.50 per cup.

"I go to Mexico all the time just to get tacos, so when I heard about this place I had to Make sure I made the pit stop here. We arrived at 10am and we're done eating by 10:45am. The wait can get pretty long, but I don't mind waiting for food that I actually love. I don't mind paying 2.25 for a taco because it's vegas and if you're gonna complain about the prices then you might as well stay home and eat jack in the box tacos. The food was really great and very flavorful. These tacos are the closest you will get to TJ tacos! Amazing. There are different lines for everything, but it seems like they were going for the feel you get when you go to there TJ locations. The only thing I didn't like was the security guard letting certain people cut in front of everyone who was waiting in line. It is small in there but I don't think they realized how much people would love the food when they opened it! Overall it was worth the line",0.0

"Brought my car in to replace the rear pads and rotor (at 75K because of warping) so they checked all the brakes.  The technician forgot to tighten the lug nuts on the front wheel so while on the highway the wheel became loose, lost a lug nut and 3 other lug nuts were loose.  I brought the vehicle back and without looking at the vehicle they said there was no damage to the vehicle but they would check to make sure all the lug nuts were tight.  The service manager didn't even consider if there was wheel alignment damage, damage to the lug net screws or anything else.

"Trugreen has unusual accounting practices.  We cancelled service before they came out to do a first treatment--within 2-3 days.  They took $500 on day 1, $800 in the next 2 days on our credit card, and another $500 on our card in a week.  They said they would credit us daily, but instead charged us again.  Calls to them over and over again were responded to with stories saying they would refund us, but the stories are very frustrating.   In fact, my husband just spoke to them here and and they claimed the $800 they charged us was a refund!  OMG!  the statement on our credit card clearly states that it is a CHARGE! For real??  Then the second $500 charge was claimed to be a ""mistake""  Really?  A mistake 3 weeks after the contract was cancelled?  So we were charged $1800 for cancelled lawn service without even one treatment.  Beware, beware, beware.  Finally, went to credit card company and am requesting a chargeback.  They will not issue you a refund.  If they do, they may not know how to use their machine and simply charge you again!

My wife took one bite of her fajita and pushed her plate away. I ate half of one of the enchiladas and tried a little of the rice and beans.

I usually use the hour or so to get them done to take a nap so will definitely continue to book first thing in the morning when it's a little slower. The girl who did them was friendly & offered helpful guidance on what would look\/ feels the best. She was great! (I'm sorry I can't recall her name but think she's currently the only lash tech.)

"I can not stop thinking about The Alley Cat . The whole experience here truly uplifted everyone's spirits ! We stopped in downtown Cleveland on the way home from a wedding and landed at the Alley Cat.  The menu alone incited so much excitement and it was so very difficult to decide what to order .  Very unique menu with a variety of exclusive options .  
The  milieu of the restaurant was beautiful .  Open windows everyone had a view of  the water, and rooftop seating available .  
The staff was social, even the people pouring water and bussing wanted to make sure we had everything we needed and were enjoying ourselves .

The food. Oh the food . Both seafood and landfood lovers will be sure to find something exceptional and particular on the menu. The clam chowder soup was hearty and came topped with fresh chives . The baked oysters were delicious.  The beef tartar was fresh and the meat was tender . The charred broccoli Caesar salad was a fresh and welcomed take on a classic.  The halibut collar and scallops had awesome flavor profiles .  I would have appreciated a little more dressing on the Lobster roll , that being said the Lobster plentiful and fresh.

"Desperate for a quick and tasty meal after a long day and turned to Yelp for help finding an option in Markham while in town for a quick overnight.  While there were numerous options, I recognized the Jack Astor name and remembered the friendly bar tendered from a past trip to Vancouver.  So despite multiple options represented in Yelp, all with sold reviews, I went with the known entity. 

The facility itself was especially inviting, especially with the beautiful weather and outside seating area.  I did pass on outside seating as offered by the hostess as I wanted to sit at the bar.  It's a table for one thing for me. 

The bartender was on his game and after sitting down for no more than 2 minutes, the bar keep was in front of me to take my drink order.  The bartender asked if I wanted the small pint or the large pint. Really?   Isn't a pint a pint?   I requested small pint and surprisingly, the beer was served in glass larger than the rest of the pints patrons were drinking.  

When I had questions about menu selection, the bar keep was happy to provide advice.  I selected the seared Tuna bowl which features rice, a few veggies and I was told Quinoa.  I was also told the bowl was a big serving.  I was starving.  While it flavor was very good, I was disappointed with the portion size as a dinner portion and the rice didn't seem fresh.  

I would have rated the experience four if the portion sizes were adequately described. Plus, never during the course of the meal did the bartender ask how things were.  He did when he presented the bill at the end.  

Jack Astor's is still ok in my book for a fast casual chain meal, but I couldn't recommend Astor's as a dining experience or capable of providing ""memorable food"".

Prompt, thorough, compassionate, efficient, funny, warm, affordable, she goes well beyond what we could ever imagine as the best in cat care. This past Christmas our family plans changed suddenly and, typically, we would have had to find emergency care for our felines.

"IV Revival saved me last night. I was extremely ill and didn't keep anything down for over 24 hours and couldn't even get water in. Matt sent a message late in the day to IV Revival. Tony called us in a timely manner and despite our inquiry being close to end of business for them, he got a nurse scheduled to come out right away. She arrived and explained everything, got my IV going with a cocktail to help with muscle soreness and nausea along with vitamins and minerals.  Within 15 minutes I could feel a bit of relief and by the time she was done I could feel my body relax. My muscle cramping dissipated. I slept well but woke up feeling very dehydrated still. So, I booked another appointment for 8:30am. The nurse showed up timely and he quickly got me going and it made a huge difference. By noon today I started feeling human again and ate for the first time since Thursday night this evening. Had I not used their service I would have ended up in the ER for dehydration.

They even have ""Almond Duck"" which most Chinese Restaurants no longer serve. The Pork Hash is excellent as are the other dishes they serve. Great lunch specials too. Highly Recommended.",0.0
"Absolutely the worst most disgusting theater I have ever been to. Don't fall for the ""premium power recliner seats"" they falsely advertise on the website. They are covered in duct tape! Yes duct tape. Also if you sit in rows D or higher you cannot see half the screen. Something I reported to management which they responded with yes we have been aware of it for 3 years, but don't disclose on their website which is where you reserve seats. This place is a joke.

"Normally enjoy this place. But it must've been my #hangry-ness affecting my reaction. Called to place an order for pick up to prevent waiting. No one answered. 

Drove down with the intentions to eat instead of pick up. Kudos to Liu, the bartender, who was practically the host (would've eaten in the restaurant if there was a host at the door), server,  and my expo since the one in charge was busy talking to someone and I saw the cook mouth the order and the expo was not even 2 feet away from the window. Liu saw me eyeing my food from the bar, walked over to package it up while the one in charge of expo was still talking and got me on my merry hungry way. So great customer service from the bartender! I'd rate him a 5\/5 since he didn't have to do any of it.",0.0

"Ate here at 7:30 on a Friday night. We had no problem with a reservation, even though the place was full and were seated right away.  The waiter was great, and the food was very good.  There was a mix of people (families, girls nights, obvious dates) around us and everyone seemed to be having a good time.  Started with the Mussels, which were good, but the chorizo sauce is what makes them. Make sure to ask for extra bread to continue dipping until your next course. The burger was very good as well and we will definitely be back.",0.0
"We had a big group of eight at Crave... appetizers, drinks, and entrees. As far as appetizers, the firecracker shrimp was my favorite. The sauce on the shrimp was creamy and super flavorful. The tuna flat bread was a close second... the jalape√±os really made the dish. The lettuce wrap appetizers were okay, a little more chewy then I prefer. 
I ordered the raspberry daiquiri made with their homemade raspberry pur√©e. The drink was surprisingly tart. I tried someone else's ginger pear martini which I wish I would have ordered... that was delicious! 
For entrees I ordered the caprese flat bread... the description makes it sound like the whole thing is loaded with tomatoes which it's not. It's tastes good, but I was expecting from the description a pile of tomatoes and it was really just a couple of tiny pieces... kinda like pico de gallo. 
My boyfriend got the miso salmon * salmon anything is usually my favorite... maybe we're spoiled from being from the Pacific Northwest, but the salmon didn't have a lot of flavor and the veggies were kind of transparent and oily.  Order the flat bread stay away from the salmon.",0.0

They had a short menu which is great for me because I can get overwhelmed with pages of choices!  I chose the Beef Brisket and a side of Cheesy Grits.

"I was going to post about how much i loved this place but then i started thinking about all of the weird moments I've had that overruled the great specials they used to have. Once I've called in and there was a really creepy guy that would keep calling me back on my cell phone trying to talk to me and a lady maybe the owner or something is beyond rude and makes excuses as to why she needs to be rude. After tonight i can't say I'll ever go back. They had the best garlic knots but it's not worth the type of service they are okay with putting out there. There's too many pizza places to try and find better service. 

We have a flyer from Pizza On 87 that did not have any expiration date on their specials. One stated Friday's and Saturday's that you could get an add on to your pizza order for a appetizer for 3.99 and they won't honor it. I almost wanted to run over there and show that to them which I'll just take a picture and post. I hope the owners read this so they can possibly change their attitudes so they are aware of the type of employees they hire is going hurt their business. I don't even care if they went out of business. I am beyond baffled with how this woman spoke over the phone. I am beyond livid.

"Food and outdoor atmosphere great!!  John our server was exceptional with recommendations and attentiveness. We are here on a business trip and didn't have many restaurants to pick from at the Hyatt. We just arrived this evening. I had gnocchi with short ribs that were so tender it melted in my mouth. Husband had pasta with shrimp and sausage which was good and very spicy. We had salads that were great too. I had spinach and he had the house.  Plenty of delicious bread and oil or butter. Gelato for dessert and we were stuffed!  Got free tickets for a gondola ride but will do that another night. The huge gas fire pit was the perfect touch to add to the palm tree ambiance and keep us warm too. It was 65 degrees and so comfy with the blazing fire right next to our table. Servers for water, bread and wine were on the ball too. So nice all around. Give it a 5!!!",0.0
"Kind of dive-y, low key place to hang out with friends or watch a game. There are several TVs, shuffleboard and pool tables, and lots of big tables. The beer selection is great, and the green chile quesadilla is pretty good. I thought the fries could have been bigger and crispier, but maybe that's just my bias. I didn't see this until after I ordered my beer, but apparently if you get a quesadilla you can get a Mexican beer for $2.50! They also have a few cocktails on the menu.",0.0

"This is my home. Has been for about 7 weeks. Dustin is the main reason I moved in, I mean they are beautiful apartments that have everything I was looking for in my budget. He has just been nothing but friendly, professional, helpful, and apologetic when needed. He helped everything go smoothly and has assisted where he can with issues I have had with my apartment. I would give him 5 Stars if I could just do a review on him alone, but since for the whole apartment I will have to go with 4. If I could do 3 1\/2 I would. 
I was super excited to move in, even when it took me driving down to figure out whether I got the apartment or not. Answering the phone is NOT a priority to them and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon. They are extremely understaffed and over worked, but always have a smile and friendly word when I go into the office (mainly Dustin). There does not seem to be a property manager for the complex. Maintenance is a HUGE issue. They have a new supervisor, we'll see if that makes a difference. I have had issues since moving in that are just now being taken care of. The only reason they are getting done is because I finally spoke with a regional manager (Ivette) that is spending some time there a couple days a week. 
Communication is where they fall so very short. I work in customer service and if I was as bad at my job as they are at calling people when they say they will, I would have been fired by now. I have had 7 people say they will call me about various issues, about when things will be scheduled, and about the status of my work orders and of those only 2 have ever followed though. Dustin and Ivette. Too bad they can't just make them the permanent managers. It has taken me leaving work early on a few occasions to get things done which is a huge inconvenience especially if they want their rent on time. It would be nice if they offered to compensate me for the issues and my time off since I wouldn't have had to miss work if they answered their phone and communicated when they said they would.
All in all, I love my home and once everything is fixed (which is scheduled to be done over the next few weeks thanks to Dustin and Ivette), I know that I will love it even more. I hope to be able to update this to a 4 Star rating soon.",0.0

"As others have noted, the portion sizes are extremely small. The food is decent, but nowhere near as good as Empress Taytu close to downtown. The ambience of that restaurant is much better as well, whereas Zoma is one crowded room. I wanted to give them a second chance because I do love Ethiopian and the first night I went was their opening night, but the second time around was just as lackluster. The portions of actual substantive food is extremely small and instead you are given mounds of dry injera. The service is terrible as they care more about making a profit than they do about making customers happy. For example, they will not give you any more of anything. Will not be coming back for good this time!",0.0
"My husband and I were looking forward to trying an incredible pizza but what a serious disappointment!  
We arrived on a Sunday night and got seated right away.  I immediately noticed all the trash on the floor but decided to overlook the cleanliness issue until I saw a huge COCKROACH crawling on the wall next to our table.  I was so disgusted so I immediately notified the hostesses and their response was appalling.  They made no attempt to deal with this crawling disgusting bug.  I had to make a big deal about it and finally the guys sitting at the table next to ours killed the bug.  By that time my appetite was nonexistent!   The manager finally came over and apologized and offered a free dessert which we did not want so they discounted the bill. After all of the drama, the pizza was very mediocre.  
I will never return to this filthy establishment.  I don't even want to think about how dirty the kitchen is if they have cockroaches crawling and ignorant hostesses that are absolutely clueless.  
Try Grimaldi's if you are looking for good pizza in Vegas.  It's mouthwatering good!!

"My husband and I came here because of the reviews we've read online. This place is popular so expect wait time to be around 1.5hrs. We went there for the first time on Friday, June 23, 2017. We didn't know we had to get a ticket before getting in line so we waited for about 20mins before realizing it. The person working there never acknowledged or greeted anyone if they don't have a ticket to enter the line to pay. Their food was ok even though they had somewhat good variety. However, for the amount you pay, the food was not worth it. Wicked Spoon buffet inside The Cosmopolitan have better food options and are delicious.

"Southern Rail is a great idea on paper. Actual execution of said idea is about as poorly executed as a North Korean missle launch. First of all, it is directly north of the light rail, this might due to poor location choice, but I'm chalking it up to a bad spin on the wheel of generic concept restaurant names. We stopped in on a Monday evening before a baseball game. The restaurant was clean, quiet, and empty.. save for a couple at the bar and a few dining in the back. The BBQ platter was the special of the evening so that seemed like a fine choice. It was to entail a platter of barbecue and 2 drinks for $25. I mean, how bad can a southern restaurant mess up barbecue?? SR went to great lengths to do just that. The waiter dropped the platter and walked away with zero explanation of what we were about to ingest. I mean, I get that it's food, but when you order something blind there needs to be some sort of delivery. There was none. I'll do my best to describe what we received; a cold cut ham po-boy (√† la quiznos), 3 slices of a pickle, a cold (possibly smoked?) fish filet, and some sort of mashed pea and corn mush, battered and fried in corn meal. All of which were bland, haven't touched a BBQ grill or smoker, and have never seen so much as a drop of barbecue sauce. I'm not denying that this wasn't a platter, but this was is no way, shape, or form, barbecue. This was an abomination. Nary a spice to be found! I'm convinced that Justin Becket's knowledge of southern cuisine is derived solely from what he's seen from Guy Fieri. Simply put; your food is bad and you should feel bad for serving it anywhere other than a company picnic. The upside to this is that the space is nice so I'm excited for whatever replaces SR. It can't come soon enough.",0.0

An appetizer in the form of dry bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar arrived and provided the first hint. 
Now for the chicken marsala.... first, the sauce tasted nothing like marsala, it tasted like the good amount of caramelized onion that was in it and that's it. The breading tasted 2-3 weeks old with freezer flavor and the chicken it self was extremely hard as if it was boiled in water for 2 hours. This was very surprising considering the fact the place was very packed and you wouldn't think they cook food in large batches and keep it frozen for days\/weeks.

Their Burgers are VERY good.  From other reviews, their breakfast is good, but I've never tried it.  Other people I went to lunch with liked their food.  It isn't amazing, but its good.  I would always choose HAYMAKER over Lakeside Bar & Grill.",0.0

"We went for Easter Brunch yesterday and our reservation was late in the day. Bad Bad Mistake.... They were out of many of the items they advertised and the food was mediocre at best.  For $35 pp, I expected it to be top notch according to previous yelp reviews.  Our waiter had to be flagged down to get service to our table most every time which was another let down.  The Eggs Benedict were dry and not good so ordered simple scrambled eggs with cheese and was charged an extra $1 for the cheese on top of the $35 pp charge.  This brunch did not include coffee or tea either.  Another extra charge of $3 pp.  I've been to other wonderful Easter Brunches at very nice restaurants that charge this kind of fee where you have steamed shrimp, prime rib, fresh salads, a multitude of choices, tea, coffee, or juices, etc.......but not the case here. Nothing special here, definitely over priced and over rated.  What a rip off of $100.  I don't know if it was just a bad day here but I guess I'll never know cause I won't be going back there and chance wasting my money. I should have asked for a refund now that I'm thinking about it.  It was truly that bad.",0.0

Best Mexican food I have had while traveling. Me and my wife love Mexican food and we always find a Mexican restaurant while on trips. We were in town for spring training and made it to this restaurant for dinner. When we arrived we weren't greeted right away. We did not know if we. Redes to wait or just take a seat. Eventually the waitress gave us a table. Drinks came out promptly and we're served in a 32 oz cup Instead of a common 16-22oz cup. No refill was needed. I always have chiles rellenos and I must say the chiles rellenos here are the best chile rellenos i have ever had including my moms. Sorry mom! My wife had the molcajete and she loved it so much as well that she talked about it for days. We seriously considered going back the next morning for breakfast but we had to get on the road early. I do think they can operate it a bit different like having a hostess dedicated to just seating and charging customers. Currently at least on the day we went there were 2 waitresses that seemed to be juggling a lot more duties than they should. Overall food gets a 10\/10 from me. While service gets 7\/10 based on waitresses being overwhelmed with duties they can't focus on the customer. I had to go look for one so I could get my bill.,0.0
I messaged Day and Night when my ac stopped blowing cold air. They responded within the hour and said they had availability the next morning. I emailed them to confirm and they called to re confirm with me a couple hours later. My technician was Kasey and he was knowledgeable and worked quickly. He diagnosed the problem and fixed my unit in less than two hours and charged a reasonable price. He even waived the trip fee since I needed a new part. Overall the experience was professional and easy. I would definitely recommend them to anyone!,0.0
"They were very busy when we stopped by for an afternoon snack and coffee, but service was still pretty quick. I appreciate that they had a few vegan choices.

Recommendation: Get the LEMON PEPPER seasoning! 

We got 2lbs Clams (lemon pepper) and 2lbs Mussels (garlic). Are the clams first, delish! A little small and most of them were out of the shells themselves. Mussels, tasted bland, so we ended up transferring them to the lemon pepper bag lol. Much better!

"This place is great if you like a wide variety of beer. Always friendly staff and a really nice patio that is dog friendly. It is usually pretty empty in this place so I do worry about how long they will last, and the hours are hit or miss as they tend to close early if it is empty. I watched them turn away 8+ people at 9pm when they close at 10pm and I don't run a bar, but that can't be good for business. They only served us one beer when we got there at 9pm and we would have been happy to spend more money but it was ""last call"" for 10pm.

We enjoyed charcuterie and the Italian fire olives, and a selection of the shared plates. The octopus fregola was a standout.

"I've made it my mission to try every restaurant with my name, so I was pretty excited to see the restaurant participating in Winterlicious. 

Unfortunately it seems I just got unlucky with my first (and final) visit here... After they cleared our table of the entrees and sides, we were completely ignored for the next 20-30 minutes before a manager came by to sweep crumbs off the tabletop and hinted that we should ask for the bill. 

It's obvious they forgot to serve our dessert because they cleared our entrees as soon as we set our forks down, but never set the dessert utensils until we mentioned we were still waiting. I mean, I get that Winterlicious = smaller portions and less expensive cuts but I didn't actually expect the quality of service to drop along with it. 

Oh we did eventually get our dessert. The chocolate tart was too hard to cut with a knife so they offered to warm it up (aka microwave) it, which turned the mousse into a giant goopy mess. Wish I took a picture but it looked so gross I didn't bother...

With that said I did enjoy the food despite the poor service, but personally would not care to return for the regular or LiciousTO menu as it was really nothing special.

Even the main Chef, came up to our table and made a little conversation which surprisingly doesnt happen anywhere except when requested. He is a Filipino man dressed up in a white chef uniform with his hat. Very professional and presentable.

I had sampled Pokito at a food event before the store opened, and judging from the prices then, I knew it would be expensive.

Being mostly a bar, Sandbar is extremely loud, so don't go looking for an intimate evening or even to have a conversation with your fellow diners. The music is loud, but good. Definitely a place to go for a fun night out.",0.0
"I brought my parents here after reading ""Gaucho Parrilla Argentina was dubbed one of the top places to eat in the country"" in the Pittsburgh Visitors Guide. The food definitely exceeded our expectations. It's kinda insane how good the food there was -- ESPECIALLY the sauces (chimichurri, garlic, onion, red pepper).",0.0
"Not much value in the menu. Staff seems to be different on each visit but if you like a sports bar with an individual TV and a broad range menu with items likely not that fresh, it's a solid option. $70 for 2 people seems a bit steep based on portion sizes. The booths are nice and you can have a quiet conversation without being rushed out.",0.0
Amazing food like your grandma makes!  Go with an appetite.  Many of the dishes can be split and you still can't finish it.  Unbelievable prices for serving sizes.  Delicious hash!!,0.0
"Maker Pizza is for sure our favourite pizza place. My fianc√© and I love pizza and in comparison we love Abruzzo and Domino's pan pizza; but after we tried Maker Pizza it has now become my no. 1 choice. Maker Pizza's doe and crust are so good~* it is also the only pizza place that we are open to trying many of their flavours and options; and non disappointed us. However : )    I am not a meat person, and my favourite order with them is Tropical Thunder (no pineapples). It has a great spicy kick to it and I love the crust love the veggies on it! But my fianc√© loves their plain cheese or pepperoni pizza~* We highly recommend ordering 5 minutes before you arrive and eat it fresh in the store! its sooooooo much better when hot and fresh!!!!",0.0
"1st time at Bangkok Thai, and it will be the first of many returns. Loved it! 
The service is friendly and attentive, nice decor, and from the traffic coming in for take out, obviously a neighborhood favorite.

Great menu with so many choices. I had the Bangkok Love. I asked the server if I could up the heat, no problem. It was perfect. I opted for 3 out of 4. Nice back heat that lingers just enough for you to go in for the next bite. My dinner mate had the Chicken Pad Thai. Very delicate and great flavor.

I can't wait to try more for my next visit. I eyeballed the tables next to us seeing so many delicious dishes.

"From the smells of the aromas billowing from this restaurant you'd think it was a BBQ heaven, but alas the dishes served here are mediocre at best.  Our family of four tried three different skewer dishes, the lamb, potato chips and squid.  While the flavours were not bad, the chef basically use the exact same marinating spices, thus giving a nearly identical taste to three different skewered dishes.  Another skewered cornbread patty was dry and tough.  We also tried a fried rice, stirfry vegetable, pork dish and dumpling dish.  All of these dishes were simply middle of the road, nothing bad but nothing outstanding.  Overall lack lustre meal, not worthy of a revisit",0.0

"As a college freshman with a meager money supply, chipotle is a must. Like any other chipotle experience, I walk out really full and satisfied.

Horrible. Walk-in pickup for a meal had the order wrong. Chicken not fresh and 10 pcs of chicken wrongly split between spicy\/mild. More spicy pcs then requested even after the cashier writing it down. They only gave me thighs and drumsticks at late lunch time. Chicken pcs were the size of a closed babies fists. I'm not even exaggerating. Don't believe? go check it out yourselves. The only thing decent was the FREE 3 pc strip you get from raptors app. Looks like this place is trying to cut cost at the cost of losing my business.,0.0
"Service was not good. The waiter (Ariel) asked me for my ID (which I'm always flattered to hear) and as I go to my purse to get it he says ""I'm not kidding"". That was a bit uncomfortable considering I didn't think he was joking. I ordered shrimp tacos with flour tortillas because I do not like corn and I still got corn. He could not remember our drink order and came over 3 times instead of just writing it down. The drinks were strong but not good. The food was not worth the price. I would much rather go to Abuelo's where we are never disappointed. I would not recommend this place. My family and I will not be returning.",0.0

This is a nice little place with bartenders who can actually hold a conversation! They know their beer and are happy to introduce some local favorites as well.

"My Boston Terrier, Pachanga  was having what seemed to be sinus or allergy issues. This was my first visit, but the other reviews were favorable so I took and chance, called today, Sunday and they advised me they were booked, but I could come in as a walk in. So I did. I was forewarned that the wait may be an hour to an hour and a half, and I was fine with that. The waiting room was clean and staff was ensuing floors were kept clean. 

The staff was great, especially the young man at the desk, courteous and pleasant. The tech was friendly and welcoming also. The doctor was wonderful, explained to me what he thought my baby may have, she had a slight loss of hair in one spot so he wanted to do a skin test. The skin test came back neg, so he prescribed antiobiotics and a spray for her rash and advised what over the count allergy medicines I could give her with the dosage for different brands. Excellent. I also had her nails clipped while we were there. It was an excellent experience with staff that explains and takes there time. Will be back for our follow up appointment.",0.0

"Oh man, I hate this star rating thing! Food and service are two completely different features of a restaurant. So I'll do the average and give the Duce a 3. It doesn't sit well with me but it is what it is. Starting with their food- delicious, savory, never disappoints. Tried majority of their menu.... most sliders, Mac & cheese bites, etc... all delicioso! Now moving on to service. At the bar, expect to wait at least 10-15 minutes before being acknowledged. After that, expect another 10 minutes for your actual drink to arrive. I've been here at least 10 times and this has been the case each and every time. Doesn't matter if the bar is slow or hectic, expect a wait. If you're pressed for time or want a quick drink, this is NOT the place for you. Couple of reasons. 1.) There is only 1 person tending bar. 2.) All cocktails are made to order, as in fresh squeezed juices, freshly chopped garnishes, etc... 
So what you end up with is almost always a delicious and perfectly fresh drink. BUT I feel that their prices are a bit absurd. For example, here now and I ordered a spicy Bloody Mary. $13.03. That's just silly. Phoenix is full of craft cocktail joints & mixologists. The reason we don't come here as much as we'd like is for this reason. We can throw a few down and don't want to pay $13 per drink while doing so. Ya feel me?",0.0

I phoned at noon to ask for a reservation, and they agreed to squeeze me in at 6 PM opening time as long as I left before 8 PM.  I declined alcohol due to my health, and they brought me hot water with lemon.  I was totally catered to - all dishes explained, no rush - just as if I was the most important customer they ever had. Although the prix fixe sounds expensive in Canadian $, it worked out to be reasonable in $US.  The presentation was gorgeous, the tastes delicious, variety charming.

It's a chain but who cares!  Service was great and we hit it at a good time when it wasn't crowded.  Got a lemonade in a huge mason jar and it was made in house; you could tell by the taste.  No powder mix here!  The names of their sauces are a bit funny such as Devil's Spit but when our server came to explain the sauces I was entertained.  She takes a plate and writes the first letter of each sauce on it explaining what they may tastes like and then gives up a small bowl of the best bbq potato chips I've had in awhile to use to dip the sauces.

Didn't do that, ended up eating the chips as is and just tapping my finger into the sauces and tasting to see how they tasted.  Hubs had a rack of baby back Memphis style ribs that were so good a couple of his bones walked away from his plate (whistles innocently) along with two sides and a cornbread muffin for $24.00.  I had a plate of rib tips which were good but as I remember them being - more fat and gristle than meat sometimes - along with my two sides.

"Quality white meat boneless wings. Plump and juicy, too. Sauce was a perfect level of tang and spicy (I got medium).
The bad: smelly inside and not very clean. This was my first visit, about 1PM on a weekday. All the tables were dirty. Some still had trash on them, but all of them had grease and crumbs. Smelly like a clogged restroom or back flow from the sewage\/drains. Service was a teeny bit slow and had a lot of errors, I figured the guy at the register taking orders was new\/ training. He was very nice, but spoke very quietly and with a mumble. No big deal, but I was over charged and so was my friend. Again, no big deal, but maybe repeat people's order back to them before they pay?

I will say it's different, so it's not a fair comparison but I was really impressed. The location is very cute with modern decor, lots of twinkle lights, comfy bar seats, roll-up garage doors, and an inviting patio. We ordered the antipasto, and the spicy salami and the mediterranean pizzas. The antipasto came with burrata and pesto, elephant garlic, lots of meats, and grilled artichoke. It was the perfect size for two people and the perfect start. The pizzas were not only thin but somehow also crispy and bready. The toppings didn't slide off from being too soggy and I actually ate the crusts. (I never eat the crusts.) The red sauce and spicy salami with caramelized onions made my night!

This Jerk King location just opened but it seems like they werent really ready.   While i was there there were 2 pairs of people before me.  The counter person was busy stacking the styrofoam containersvabove the counter and kept going to the back to put their order together.  It was a long wait so i went away for a few minutes and the people ahead of me were still waiting for their food.  I just got stuff that was in their front counter so my order was faster.  Seems there air conditioner wasnt working either.  It was as hot as Jamaica and the had a fan sitting on a table to cool the place.  It was cooler outside.  Some guy was busy shuffling photo boards on the tables in the centre so it really wasnt a place to stay and eat your food.  The chicken and dumpling i got was nothing special and the coleslaw was probably a commercially prepared slaw but it was good.  I think they need some help to make things more efficient.

This place is below a coffee and beer shop that serves food. The undertow is very small but the atmosphere is very fun. It's set up like you are below the deck of a boat. The portholes have changing pictures which was fun. Since it is so small they suggest reservations. If you're lucky (or if you go during the week) you might get a few seats but be prepared to wait over an hour for a seat. Sometimes even three so don't walk in thinking you see seats open that they really are. Show up early in the evening and you might get a spot before people have a reservation. You are limited in how long you can stay so that they can accommodate as many reservations as possible. The drinks are very fun cocktails. The smoking cannon involves them smoking cinnamon and infusing it in the glass which made for a cool presentation. We all had different cocktails and one of us were disappointed,0.0
"Super rad place - affiliated with the nearby Rhubarb Cafe, that also looked quite tasty.  The desserts are definitely works of art, and the taste matches.

Would have been tough to pick from the selections while seated, as the visuals were so lovely, but good to know for next time.  It was very nice to enjoy a treat on a sleepy Thursday AM and watch the staff bustle around in the back.  My gal really enjoyed her twice-baked house-Nutella stuffed croissant and I had a very fun n funky multilayer treat w pistachio, grapefruit, meringue and other tasty elements.  Chic joint, fun people watching, nice options.  Would really knock somebody out if you ordered one of their items to go and brought it to a party - o la la!",0.0

But it didn't matter cause these two are just perfect, also the service was great I was greeted as I came in, and the girl told me right away I'm making new doughnut right now so just take a look at the manu and tell me what  you want which was great cause the dounuts I ordered weren't  in the counter so I got so happy, cause I now I was gonna get fresh doughnuts and I did!",0.0

This place..... the session.... love love love. I can't wait to go back. I did a 2.5 hour float and was in love from the moment I walked in. My host Cheryl (?) was as sweet and welcoming as could be.

I highly recommend it to everyone except those with claustrophobia. My favorite treatment of all time - thank you!!,0.0

Yesterday, however, we had some issues with waiting for our food and our meal coming before our starters.  We told our waitress to cancel our starter as we had a movie to get to.  The manager came over and told us the meal was on her.  What??  We told her we weren't that angry but she insisted.  To the manager who was working May 6th thank you very much.

Great, relaxed atmosphere. 4 stars but 5 if they bring back half price bottles of wine!",0.0
"My family was hungry for pizza Saturday night and we looked on Yelp to help us find somewhere new for us,  The reviews for Pizza My Dear were great so we figured to give them a shot.  When we arrived we weren't aware there were only two tables as this is a mainly pick up and delivery location but the staff was extremely accommodating.  We grabbed a couple of menus and decided on Jalapeno poppers, a small Hawaii 5-O, and a large New York style with Pepperoni, Mushrooms (HUGE), Green Peppers, and Garlic.  We also ordered a six pack of Pepsi for $4.99 that saved us a ton compared to going to a sit-down place at $3 per drink.  Everything came out hot as we were right there and it was fantastic!  Thanks to the great staff who checked on us and gave us a wonderful experience.",0.0
"I'm caught in the middle of giving this place 3 or 4 stars but really I feel like the restaurant deserves 3.5. Located in Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor, prepare for a long walk. 

Made reservations ahead of time for a party of 4 and got the Fried Chicken & Caviar, the menu says serves up to 4-6 people but I can imagine it serving even 8. If you do decide to try this make sure you call ahead of time and let them know so they can prepare the order in advance. 

The Fried Chicken & Caviar included two chickens that are fried whole, carved, then paired with a choice of Momofuku Reserve caviar, we chose the 8oz Smoked Trout Roe ($328) ... They provide you crepes that you use as a tortilla and truffle creme fraiche to top off. This dish was very intriguing but after some thought I don't feel like it was too amazing.. chicken was cooked well and was moist, and the Truffel creme fraiche was the savior... Put that on top of anything you eat and you got yourself a winner. 

We also got some small dishes to balance with the meat: 
Bigeye Tuna - shaved foie gras, stone fruit; I would say pass on this, it sounds good but it wasn't to my liking. 
Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond; very tasty and full of flavor, it was light and refreshing.
Chinese Broccoli - black garlic, ginger; cooked well and tasted good but it's like anything you would typically get at a Chinese restaurant. 

I also got a cocktail for myself called Toki Thyme, I really liked the drink! It was well mixed and refreshing to drink throughout dinner. 

Final thoughts: Service was okay, our waitress forgot about us a few times. The atmosphere of the venue and view of the Las Vegas strip was cool and chill, especially accompanying hip hop music playing in the background. 
The presentation and deliverance of the dishes were great but the food itself was just okay. I feel everything may have been too hyped up and it just fell a bit short for me. Good experience but I wouldn't come back again.",0.0
"The portions are small with not a lot of filling for the price. The basket of nachos with pico de gallo was so small, we ran out of chips before we barely touched the salsa. Added gaucomole and it was an extra $8! Food was just ok. They try to upsell you on food and drinks.",0.0
"Another brewpub having several own beers (between 8 to 12), decently priced I would say ($7,5 tax excl.). You can order a flight of 4 for $12, but!!! You cannot have flights on Fridays and Saturdays which led me to believe that this is rather a money hungry establishment. The burger is $15 and comes rather in a larger-than-average portion. 

I tried their Belgian brown ale which obviously was a Flemish Red Ale and their oat IPA, which had oats and some sweetness, but needs more of them. 16% of oats in the brew kettle is clearly not enough to differ from usual IPAs.

Our waitress was kind but she forgot to bring water with half of the tables empty. You can also buy their bottled beers. They are brewing biweekly new brews, especially sours. As of July 31st, a plum sour will hit the shelves. 

A good place to try new beers, but of you want to have flight go during weekdays. I'll go a couple more times to try their beers and will comment on that later. It s  3.5 stars, not 4 if you ask me",0.0
"If I could give this practice 0 stars I would...  A little over a year ago, I noticed a spot on my forehead that looked suspicious, so I went in to have a full body check up on November of 2016.  I mentioned to the P.A. who examined me that I was particularly concerned about the forehead.  She passed me with flying colors - no issues whatsoever and nothing to be concerned about.  Coming from a trained expert in dermatology, I assumed everything was ok.  About 2 months ago, I was at my skincare specialist in Scottsdale and he said that he was very concerned about the spot on my forehead and advised me to go back, insist on seeing a doctor and insist that they do a biopsy.  I did that in late October 2017 and the biopsy came back that I did, in fact have basal cell carcinoma!  I'm beyond upset that the cancer has been on my face for a year when it should have been caught back in 2016.  When I called and talked to the office manager about the situation, all she could say is ""I'm sorry..."".  I""m now scheduled for removal surgery in December with a doctor from a different practice - I will under no circumstances ever go back to Arrowhead Dermatology again.....",0.0
Went to Glow for a medical pedicure. There is only one chair for this treatment. It's a bench with thin cushioned padding with a foot rest that was too close and too high. My knees were up around my chin. It was so uncomfortable that I had a sore back when it was finally over. The person doing the pedicure talked non-stop through out the whole treatment and rushed me out at the end because she didn't want to miss her go train. I left the spa with cling wrap around my polished toes which still smudged because I was rushed out before they were dry. The overall experience was not relaxing and the actual pedicure well below average. Definitely not worth $60.,0.0

There was plenty of food and we even had to take home. The pork bone soup, I will definitely come back for. The meat was so tender and falling off the bone and so much different spices and flavours. It was perfect with the purple rice which was delicious too. I'm dreaming about it now! This is a small place but we arrived before 5pm so we were able to get a table no problem. However, once 5:30 hit, there were line ups and lots off people doing take out. That's a testament of how good this place is. Highly recommended, all the dishes that came out of the kitchen looked fantastic. I have to come back!",0.0
"Warning! Not for dim sum beginners. This place is cramped and noisy, however the food here is worth the price. My parents took me here and the total bill came out to $25 for 7 dishes. Some of my favourite dishes were the squid tentacles (better than others Ive tried), and the bean curd in oyster sauce. Their Siu mai is very good, but their hargow is pretty plain. The curry cuttlefish is satly so be forewarned. Other good dishes are the chicken feet and rice rolls. This is a family favourite, just because we are pretty used to the environment. If you can bypass the poor english, the cramped restaurant, and the noise, it can be a cheap delicious dim sum experience in scarborough.",0.0

I tried their pho, grilled beef vermicelli, and curry beef rice. I also tried their tri colour ice drink (mung bean, red bean, green jelly). Both the pho and curry beef rice were a bit on the saltier end. The taste wasn't anything spectacular either. Although the portions were decent, it wasn't something that I would go for again. The grilled beef vermicelli had a lot of beef which was good, but the overall was too sweet. I usually pour the whole bowl of sauce that comes with it in and it's a decent sweetness, but this sauce was way too sweet which made the whole dish not very good (I am someone who enjoys foods on the sweeter side and this was too much for me).

The tri colour ice drink was your typical cup size so again, it was a decent size.

The pair of chopsticks I was given was also sticky. I waited a while trying to call the waitress to switch to a new pair but there was no one around (even though it was just my table and 2 others in the restaurant).

"We really enjoyed our stay at Paris. The burgundy room was nice. There is a great selection of cafes and restaurants in and around the hotel. We also found it to be very quiet compared to other locations and got a good night's rest. We were on the side with no view and overlooking rooftops which may have helped. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is the lack of cleanliness and updates at the pool. We arrived after it opened and were there a few hours sunbathing. The water was very dirty with a lot of dirt and debris. We chose not to go in for that reason. The patio itself is in dire need of power washing and the trash bins, particularly those for cigarettes etc., were overflowing, which was what we noticed the prior evening when we took a peek at the pool. They had still not been emptied. We did not locate one, but it would be nice to have a water fountain to fill our own bottles at no cost instead of buying bottled water which is expensive and not environmentally friendly. What we did like about this pool was that it was peaceful and quiet overall, especially in the morning. It was a good place to just relax and did not have that club vibe.",0.0

"This place is a great place to have a nice fancy dinner close to the Convention Center. It's at the top of the Hyatt and the entire restaurant slowly rotates so you can see the view of the city as you spin around. Unfortunately it was dark when we came, and raining, so the view was not optimal. This would be awesome at sunset for a romantic date!

The food was delicious. Everything we tried, we liked. The fondue was a wonderful way to start out our meal. The wedge salad was also fabulous. It comes with dates and apples and bacon - really a nice combination. I ordered the pasta - Truffled Bolognese. It was also delicious.... A nice earthy pasta with a hint of unexpected sweetness at the end. The portion was large - I did not finish it all. I would get that again. For dessert we had the black and white chocolate cake. Between two of us we could not finish it - SOOOOOO RICH! Wow, just one bite was enough!! 

The hostess at the front desk was very nice and pleasant. She was great at managing lots of people. Our waitress was weird!! She did not make our experience enjoyable at all. She was like a robot.

"Nobu definitely lives up to it's reputation. This was a last minute splurge that replaced dinner reservations elsewhere. The menu is extensive and offers a wide range of options. There was so much to choose from, we ended up trying the Omakase multi-course dinner with flights of sake and whiskey as we thought this would be the best way to experience the chef's signature dishes. 

Our meal started with cold appetizers which included chef's sushi and sashimi assortments. The Whitefish with Yuzu sauce just melts in your mouth while the crunchy sea grapes offers a different textural experience. The salmon carpaccio Salad with Lettuce Handroll was refreshing and crispy. The Chef's Sushi Assortment and Chef's Sashimi Assortment were decadently amazing. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalape√±o, toro, Salmon Tartare with Caviar, Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar. Yum! The pickled peach that accompanied the appetizers was delicious.

Our hot entrees included their signature Black Cod Miso, which was succulent and both sweet and savory. The Beef Toban Yaki was tender and nicely paired with mushrooms and caramelized onions. I liked this much better than the NY bone-in steak we had for dinner the prior night at Bouchon. While the tofu was delicious, the miso soup was a little salty for me. I actually couldn't finish it after a couple sips. 

We finished dinner with the bento box dessert which included a sinfully rich flourless Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Sauce, Shiso Syrup & Green Tea Ice Cream.  

The service was wonderful and ambiance lively.

"Turkey, Prime Rib, the  Cuban- the best sandwiches I have ever eaten in Cleveland! The bread is perfection; not too thick but thick enough that the whole thing doesn't get soggy and collapse into mush. It's crunchy where it needs to be and firm enough to keep all of the delicious meats and cheeses held together, and it's fresh baked.

The meats are roasted, heavenly, juicy, flavorful, amazing, and I promise you'll crave them! Once you try a sandwich here, you're gonna be hooked.",0.0
Was looking for a new coffee place to try!!! I love coffee! So found this on yelp when I went in the two young employees greeted my husband and I. I ordered a 20 oz hot white chocolate and macadamia nut mocha. The young boy seemed to be training. The other employee seemed as if she knew what she was doing. I tasted the coffee before leaving. It was bland and lacking coffee and flavor! I asked for a little more white chocolate in the hopes it would improve the taste or lack of. In the end I just threw away the coffee and went to Starbucks. The concept is amazing but the execution was a fail. I saw so many positive reviews so I gave it a shot. Maybe it was improper training but I will not risk wasting six more dollars to give it another try.,0.0
Good fresh sea food at not so bad prices. Food seemed fresh not frozen and staff friendly. Not to mention it's right by the water so great view outside. They also have non sea food if you prefer chicken or some other menu item. Plus they are open late. The fish hit the spot. I'd definitely revisit.,0.0

"Today I woke up with the most terrible pain radiating from one of my teeth. I knew from previous experience that this was going to be a root canal. I called around to a few places and sadly no one was willing to squeeze me in. After reading the reviews about this place I decided to call them and from the moment the receptionist answered the phone I was snagged. 

I will start with her, she was super helpful and genuinely wanted to help me. She made the whole process flow very smooth and she was super nice with a great spunky personality that just radiates over the phone and through the office. I really appreciated all that she did for me and for being awesome!! 

The techs that helped the dr were also equally as amazing! The main tech helping with me was very good about keeping me notified about each step that was happening and she was great about checking to make sure I was doing ok throughout it all and kept me very comfortable. 

The doctor did a fantastic job. How many people can say they went and got a root canal and kept falling asleep during it? Not many. Enough said.

"Worst service ever. Place has went downhill. Kept my car 2 1\/2 days and still didn't fix the issue! First, they said the coil had to be replaced and recommended replacing the plugs but it wasn't necessary (BTW..they wanted to charge $210 for just the plugs!!) They replaced the coil and I literally drove it off the lot, down the road, not even a mile and my car is missing gears and light are flashing.  Take it back and a different guy suggested that all plugs need to be replaced after coil replacement. Total miscommunication on their part. Save your money and time, go somewhere else.",0.0

"The service here was disappointing. We went here to celebrate a special event, and were treated awfully. We were seated out on the patio after a 25 minute wait, only to find the patio practically empty- except for a huge photo shoot that was going on. This included a full crew, very bright lights, and loud conversation directing the shoot. It completely ruined the ambiance and was very distracting. The lights were so bright we had trouble keeping eye contact and spent most of the meal looking down at our plates. We asked to be reseated because of the bright lights, so they moved us a few tables over, which hardly made a difference. The picture shows the view of the shoot from our second table. I love Fox restraints, but we will not be going back.",0.0

"This French brunch spot and bakery is always packed! I've been a couple times and left quite satisfied. The fresh breads and pastries are unbelievably delicious.

I would suggest you arrive before 10am to avoid the rush. Otherwise you are sure to need to wait. On a summer day, the patio is a great place to be in the morning!

We stumbled on this place after Slippery Mermaid said they were done seating people at 8:30pm on a Friday evening. So glad they did because the sushi here was some of the best I've ever eaten. We ordered a sushi platter and got a delicious sample of sushis. 38 pieces for only 30.00. The rainbow roll was so fresh and made to perfection. The staff was super friendly and stayed to talk to us after our meal. This hidden gem will be a place I will most certainly be frequenting. Only had sushi but their menu is extensive and impressive as well. Add this to your go to place!,0.0

The corporate office included 2 gift cards for free entrees and asked that we try the location again.  We decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt and returned.  We showed the server our gift card and he was not sure what it was for.  He showed it around to several other employees and gave me about 2-3 ounces of orange chicken in a to go box.  I had planned on eating in, nobody bothered to ask.  I won't be back, I'm very disappointed but will happily spend my money locally at Chen's Garden or Seoul Garden right down the street.

"This is one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to in Vegas. To be honest the food is just mediocre, nothing special. Even the top recommended appetizer which was a cheese dip was just nothing special. The service is where they really get bad marks. The first time I came here I was a little drunk and the serve did not seem to be too enthused about serving us. It was past midnight so most people were in the same boat and had been out drinking and it was a loud restaurant. Our server was extremely rude. The second time I came back sober and we started out being quoted for a 30 minute wait and waited an hour perhaps more. Luckily we were in a casino so we could keep busy, but they have no way of communicating with you if you are gambling and not in the immediate area where their host stand is. Host kept assuring us it wouldn't be much longer but obviously it was. Then the food took forever to come out and our server was unapologetic. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.",0.0

Dr. DiPerna is kind and thorough in learning about your dental history and your goals. He is meticulous in his work. He explains everything ahead of time and while he is working. Dr. DiPerna and everyone I have seen at that office have always answered my questions.  The hygienist and assistants who worked with me were knowledgeable and always very kind. Every appointment whether I saw Dr. DiPerna or a member of their team it was clear to me that person had taken the time to familiarize themselves with my history and we met with an understanding of my condition and goals. I have had at least six visits in the past nine months and every single interaction with everyone I met was positive whether it was directly related to my care, or scheduling or payment.

This place used to be a Holiday Inn a long time ago and had a nice pool and hot tub. It seems now it's a Marriott that they don't care about the pool and now it's a sad place. They filled in and covered up the hot tub. They drywalled and painted the ceiling over the pool which makes it feel really low. You can imagine how it used to be with a nice natural wood ceiling and plants instead of just dirt in the planters below the windows. Don't stay here if you were considering the pool as a feature. Maybe some other hotel company will take over in the future and embark on restoration work on the pool so that it doesn't look so neglected and forgotten.,0.0

"Do not get the non-ethanol from here. I don't know exactly what's wrong with it, but I cannot use it.

The first time the issue occurred was summer last year. I purchased non-ethanol there then went to Cabela's across the road. The bike ran fine going to Cabela's, but when I left the bike started stumbling at 3500 rpm. I called a local shop and told them I was going to ride it there for them to look at it. It stumble for 10 miles, then all was fine, no more stumbling. I called the shop and they said the bike likely had water in the tank. Water is denser than gasoline so it settles at the fuel pickup in the bottom of the tank, meaning I eventually ran the water out. I thought just maybe I was being paranoid and the bike was just having issues that day (really uncommon for this bike) so I went back again, same issue. 

I was worried because I had planned a trip to the Blue Ridge Mtns and really didn't want any issues to interrupt my plans. I made my trip on the bike covering well over a thousand miles with absolutely no issues. I returned to the same gas station after the trip the following week, same problem. So I called SCDOA and they didn't find anything unusual. I stopped returning to this gas station until last week and then today I got fuel there, same issue. I spoke with the manager and he had not found anything wrong with the fuel nor had any other complaints.

The problem is ongoing and neither the gas station nor SCDOA can detect the problem which means they likely will not fix it.

I then posted on Craigslist and NextDoor and found several people who wanted to see the apartment within a day. On their final day before I would have been owed a refund, they found someone...a person I'd already found on Craigslist and who had already made an appointment to see the apartment, who ended up taking over the lease.

"I've been to Smash quite a few times whether it's brunch , dinner or their prix fixe menus . I've always enjoyed my meal and the service .

Food 4\/5
I most recently came here on Monday for dinner . They had the $10 pizza special which was definitely a great deal . I ordered the Smash Lovers pizza , Neptune pizza , lobster Mac & cheese and the ahi tuna wontons . The Smash Lovers is essentially a meat lovers pizza with pepperoni , ground beef and bacon . The topping amount was generous and every bite had each ingredient on it . The Neptune had smoked salmon , shrimp and was drizzled in balsamic vinaigrette . The salmon pieces were fairly big which felt like you were getting your money's worth . However there wasn't enough balsamic which made the salmon too salty and overwhelming . The next dish is the  Ahi tuna wontons are expensive for what they are . Each plate comes with three fried wonton wrappers topped with slaw , tuna and a dab of horseradish aioli . It tasted fine but the horseradish seemed completely random and didn't compliment the dish that well . Lastly we had the lobster Mac & cheese . I don't recall eating any lobster pieces but you can never go wrong with such a classic dish . The dish was super cheesy but had pico de gallo mixed in the pasta . The pico de gallo gave the pasta  a cleaner dish so it wasn't as greasy or heavy .

"Even though there were only a few people waiting it took them 3 1\/2 hours to service my car.  I had this done on a Saturday.  On the following Monday one of the tires went flat.  I called them to see if they towed and they didn't.  I asked them, once I got someone to put on my spare, if they would stay a little late to put on a new tire since this one was defective (it split on the side seam and was not caused by a puncture- I suspect dry rot) and the manager put me on hold for 5 minutes and came back and said that they didn't have any more in stock and I would have to come in the next day.  Being in customer service for years, and since it was a pretty common tire, I suspected that no one was willing to stay a little late or that they didn't want to pay overtime.  I went in the next morning and they took one hour to put a new tire on.  Then, because I didn't purchase road hazard insurance they told me that Goodyear wouldn't cover the entire cost and i had a bill of $60 on top of the $891 I had already paid them.  Now, the flat wasn't caused by road conditions, it was caused by a defect in the tire.  So why would I have to pay anything for a defective tire?  At that point I broke down and started to cry as I had no more money and they let me go.  When I got to work I took a look at the new tire and they didn't even put on my hubcap.  It was still attached to the spare.  And to add insult to injury the manager kept humming.  I was so upset and he just kept humming!  So rude and dismissive and so passive aggressive that it just made me angrier.  I went to them because I thought they had a good reputation, but I will never step foot in that place again.",0.0

"My husband just brought me a soup on his lunch break because I am sick... I had him get the Yucat√°n chicken tortilla soup for me.  He brought home the bag that included the large soup, a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry.  The soup did NOT include the avocado, the lime or the tortilla strips!  I called the Chandler location he visited and the employee that answered the phone just said something along the lines of ""oh sorry, its complimentary, they must have forgotten to add it to the bag, it's a busy time right now"" I said ""ok, well it's suppose to come with the soup right?"" And she basically just said ""yeah it's complimentary"" - but is it really complimentary if it's listed as ingredients of the soup and pictured on the menu????  Is it complimentary if you pay for the soup and it's suppose to come with it?  She offered that I come back to the restaurant to pick up my ""complimentary"" items, but I am sick, which is why I didn't go get it myself in the first place!

"Extremely unprofessional. My son's driving in-cars were cancelled numerous times by 2 different instructors. We made arrangements for him to be home for the instructor to pick him up, and nobody showed up or the instructor would cancel 10 minutes before.

This is after we were told that it would be mailed out 2 weeks ago. We now have to make further arrangements to our work schedules to accommodate the fact that my son cannot get his driver's license until this school provides the completion certificate.

"I was very disappointed in this place. The staff seemed constantly confused and were mixing things up despite the restaurant not being very busy. I asked for a straw three times and they finally arrived to the table next to us. Our appetizers also made a trip to the wrong table before finally making it to us. We did the 48 dollar four courses that was a good deal but the food just wasn't up to par. The tuna from the tuna tartare was bad. Smell, taste, texture, everything. The waiter was kind enough to trade it out for a different appetizer but it really was unpleasant to taste and let my husband a bit sick. My salmon for the main dish was horribly over cooked despite asking for medium and very tough on top.  The dessert of banana creme pie was delicious just a little too much and overwhelming. While using the ladies room i found missing tiles and a hole in the wall filled with toilet paper. Over all table ten is just an unimpressive place and needs some serious review.

"Just had them out for an estimate for biweekly service. Explained the owner that we had just moved into the house and had a paid several hundred dollars to have a thorough cleanup so all we needed at this point was biweekly service. The owner insisted that I would have to pay him $100 for a cleanup. I asked him what that $100 would include since all of the palm trees, bushes, trees etc. had already just been trimmed the previous week. He said it did not matter, I must pay him a $100 cleanup fee. I again asked him what that $100 would include and asked if he would please come look at my backyard so he could see that there was no additional work that needed to be done... Just biweekly maintenance.  He walked in the backyard and agreed that everything had already been done but still insisted that I would have to pay him $100 cleanup fee but could not tell me what that cleanup fee would include since everything had already been done.  What a scam! Not only is the hundred dollar cleanup fee ridiculous, he was rude and I would never work with someone like that.",0.0

"Let's get down to it. Two long time vegan travellers visited for the first time yesterday for Saturday brunch. The decor while nice, can best be described as ""pintresty"". High ceilings and hallway-like space makes it a bit loud. I had the vegan Big LOV burger, she had the vegan Haskap Berry Grilled Cheese, and we shared a side of potatoes. 

The first bite of the burger gave an immediately reaction that I had that taste before. Then I realized the name and recognized the taste as a Big Mac, pretty spot on! I cannot say that I missed that taste, but I can't say that it was bad - just wasn't ""wowed"". The taste was more from the sauce and mix of pickle\/toppings than the burger. In fact, having a bite of the burger alone without the bread or anything else on it was surprisingly bland. It tasted like what it was - black beans.

The Grilled Cheese was pretty darn good though, for a grilled cheese! If you are looking for something different I would recommend that over the burger.

The potatoes were perhaps the best! It was a take on poutine with a vegan cheese sauce and a maple\/sriracha syrup. There was enough syrup to dip the burger in and give it a bit more of a zip!

Service was OK\/neutral. The food came out fairly quickly even though the restaurant was nearly full, but we waited a bit after we finished and ended up having to ask for our check.

I think LOV benefits most from its location near McGill. I would consider the menu to be very well done veganized college fare. Indeed most of the crowd seemed college folks either in groups or seemingly with their parents.",0.0

They were friendly and professional.

"STAY AWAY IF YOU ARE PLACING A CORPORATE CATERING ORDER! Beyond terrible customer service and unprofessional catering manager, Jen. It starts from the top and trickles down when it comes to management and how you play an example of a good customer service. I placed an order online last minute due to a last min request, I went ahead and placed the order, called into the cafe and asked if there was any way they could honor an earlier delivery time than what was given online. The answer was a hard NO, not a let me see if we can try since we are so busy, or any thing attempting to accommodate the request but I understood. An hour later, i get a phone call from Jen, the manager who tells me not only are they NOT going to honor the 12:45-1pm window I selected online but they were possibly going to get it into me by 1:30. I was very irritated at this point because had I known it was going to be even later, earlier in the morning when I placed the call, I would have ordered from another deli that I normally call and they always seem to be able to help me. At 1pm I then get a call from the """"Manager"" Jen again, when she mentions that she managed to get our order in by 12:48 exactly and I answered ""oh wow thank you for getting it in earlier than you had anticipated"". She answered back, ""Yeah so we did and just to let you know, we are never going to take an order from you again, we will not honor your orders"". She claims I yelled at her and I didn't. I was actually very monotone, but to say I sounded, unhappy and completely dis-satisfied, ABSOLUTELY. There were so many things wrong with my experience from the moment i attempted to have them accommodate me for my order. The worst of it all was the way in which she went out of her way to still deliver it and ban me. To say this was unprofessional and grossly personal is an understatement. I called corporate and wrote an email. I have gone to the extent of writing this so that others are forewarned on how TERRIBLE this store is managed. If you want a store that will partner with you when you need the catering service, this is NOT IT. When you need last minute requests because that is part of the customer service aspects, this store is not it. Luckily we have more options in Ballantyne, this will not be it for me.",0.0

"Went there for New Year's Eve, and definitely not up to the usual D'Vine standards - particularly for the price. Only thing memorable on the menu was the bisque and desert (set menu - seafood or beef). Started with the obviously new\/inexperienced hostess wanting to seat us at a high 4-top near the door, even though we were some of the first people there for the late seating. Besides the noise from the bar and music speakers, it was right next to where the music would start soon. The hostess was adamant that was the only seating she had, even with reservations, but the manager got that straightened out, and it turned out that there were several empty tables in the back during dinner, so no clue why the hostess was jerking us around. Then came the food - the strangest thing served was a large octopus tentacle that frankly looked like an animal's private part, was burnt, and chewed like rubber. I had the Chilean sea bass, which wouldn't have been bad, but it was served on a bed of cold humus, which gave it a weird taste. At any rate, not a very good meal for the cost and the occasion. Guess we'll skip holiday events there, as they appear challenging for them, and stick to going in for wine and appetizers....",0.0
"Atmosphere was decent. Food was ok.
I ordered food and I paid with my credit card. I walked back to get my card after we finished eating. The server who took my order said, ""I gave you your card back""
She didn't, so I let her know that she had not given it back. She kept repeating that she had given it to me. I kept responding with, ""no you didn't."" She then said ""I set it right here"" and pointed to the counter. 
At that point I asked to speak to a manager. 
The blonde manager in her 40's asked me to check my pockets. I declined saying that I was certain that it was never given back to me. She said ""you are the ones that have been drinking all day, not us"" 
I said, ""mam, I was polite to you, but you just crossed a line, you're statement implies I'm at fault for this because you think I've been drinking, when in all reality your staff lost my card"" 
They went to look around and came back with nothing. I logged into my account and noticed charges on the card from the same place. I called the manager over and said if she gave me my card back, how was someone able to run up charges on it? 
I showed her my phone and said this is fraud and after that was the first time she started to address the situation with some urgency. She went to the bartenders and sure enough there was an open tab at the bar with my card. They claimed ""someone found it and turned it in"" and ""I was lucky to get it back"" I asked why there was an open tab with charges on my card and they began to get mad and yell. I said I wanted a refund for the charges on my card and they said ""seriously? Do you really want us to refund you $14?"" And tried to make me look stupid. I replied with yes, actually refund me 14.85 because that's the amount fraudulently charged on my card since you gave my credit card to someone else. They gave me my money back and rudely told me to ""never come back"" like I did something wrong?! Hopefully people read this and never come back.",0.0
"TLDR - They do not provide kind or compassionate care. They might hide risks from you.  They advocate for unnecessary procedures.  They get defensive and fight with you after the birth.

I gave birth in February. I finally decided that I needed to post about my experience in hopes that it helps someone else avoid the terrible care I received.

Policy wise - The biggest policy I dislike is that they refuse to see you within 24 hours of giving birth.  Two of my Facebook friends confirmed this after the fact - one used midwives and the other the ob-gyns so it is a consistent policy across MomDoc.  If you have a cesarean and want post-op healthcare and advice you won't get it for a while.  Robyn did see me 30 hours later but then she snapped at me.  She did not give me any useful aftercare information.  The nurses kept asking if my provider had seen me during the first day.  Other medical practices will apparently help you afterwards, I suggest that you go to them instead of MomDoc.

Two of the three midwives at the hospital were awful.  If Melissa is still working, do not go to this place. During my induction, the nurses would not give me any medicine to induce after a certain point because my son was struggling on the monitor.  His heartbeat would drop below 110 and slowly come up.  I asked Melissa how my labor was progressing.  She told me not to worry that I was having a normal labor for someone who had an old placenta.  What does that mean? She left while I was confused.  How does normal labor progress in this situation? I knew that old placenta was weird ""casual"" language for placenta insufficiency or that my placenta was not giving enough nutrients.  What I did not know was what that meant for my birth.
My husband followed her a few times to try to get answered.  He caught her playing games on her phone in the hallway.  That was back when we still wanted to talk to her.
Later, Melissa advocated for different procedures - one of which was stripping the membranes.  I knew the research was mix and also that it was uncomfortable. I asked Melissa if it would help with my son's situation.  She said no.  I asked ""why would we do then?"" She gave some reasons that sounded knowledgeable. I said in relief ""It does help then"".  She said No.  I was thoroughly confused.  I only did it because my nurse said she had seen it help make labor go quickly.  Melissa did it.  It was one of the worst moments of my labor (I did experience harder contractions later).  I remembering screaming and arching my back to try to get away from her.  Melissa performed an unnecessary and painful procedure on me that she not even think was helpful. 

I remembering feel so powerless and confused.  She was honest when I asked, but still was advising me to do what she considered unnecessary procedures. After that, I did not want her around me because I could not trust her.

I was relieved when we decided to do the c-section.  I had been worried about my son's health for hours.  I remember feeling comfortable (but way out of it) during prep because they played music I liked.  When I was still open and right before they got my baby to touch my face, I heard Melissa say ""This is thickest meconium that I've have ever seen.""   This made me extremely uncomfortable while I was waiting to feel my son.  I still don't understand why she felt like she need to comment about my body while still sewing me up or at all for that matter?

This review is getting long. When Robyn finally showed up 30 hours after my c-section, I asked her what went wrong.  I thought it was placenta insufficiency but Melissa was saying that and she had shown she was not to be trusted. Robyn snapped at me that I had an OLD PLACENTA.  She woke up my husband.  She then told me that a second to last ultrasound had shown this was probably happening.  Again what?  Why was I told risk factors about my labor after the fact?  When I had that ultrasound, Ramona had made me feel comfortable because we had passed the non-stress test beautifully.",0.0

"This Izakaya is mediocre when compared to the likes of Kinka and Zakkushi. The atmosphere misses the spot. Upon entering, there is not the usual loud warm welcome from the staff, but instead you see numerous plasma screens in all corners of the restaurant. The overall feel is more like a sports bar than an izakaya, per se. 

The quality of the food does not hit the price point. We got the Hangetsu sashimi combo, the grilled salmon collar, the grilled squid, and the spicy pork. 

The hangetsu combo came with a limited selection of fish. It was all you can eat quality for the most part and had all the usual suspects of salmon, tuna, mackerel, butterfish and snapper. They did have hamachi, but the quality was not fresh and the taste was off and a bit fishy. 

The salmon collar and grilled squid were decent. In particular, the salmon was on special so we got it for a steal at 5$. The squid was also nicely grilled. 

The spicy pork was too saucy and tasted like it had been marinated for a month. The pieces were also not cut to bite-size portions. 

All in all, the menu has some decent grilled items, as should be the norm for all izakayas, but the sushi\/sashimi options on the menu should be passed on. It's not a bad place for drinks and late night food while watching sports, but there are better dinner options around for the same price level.",0.0

"I love trying new places, and I'm one of those people that never complains or sends my food back. Now, I really was rooting for this place, I wanted to like it so bad. But I had probably the worst experience I've had in a very long time. We sat inside at first, for about five minutes without anybody introducing themselves or at least taking our drink order or anything, even though our seat was right next to the kitchen where everybody was coming in and out. Finally, the only good part, was this young kid Cody. He walked by said he'd seen us sitting there awhile and noticed nobody had talked to us. He asked for our drink orders, was very nice, and we asked to move outside because we were right next to the kitchen doors and it was kind of cramped in there. Anyways, he took us outside, it was kind of full so we had to sit at a picnic table in the very back of the outside. That in itself is fine with me, there really wasn't any other tables. He got our drink orders, then as he was getting our drinks the waitress finally introduced herself briefly. He came back with the drinks, shot the shit for a minute with us, which is a good thing, and things were looking good. Then our waitress comes back and takes our order and I also order a mimosa which I ask her to keep coming with anytime I'm low. Had about a 45 minute wait until the food got there, with empty drinks and I had to ask the food server to get me another drink. My girlfriend asked for an over easy egg, it came scrambled with a strange taste to it and half of her French toast was undercooked. The menu itself was very confusing so I just got a breakfast burrito with chorizo added (which was almost four dollars extra). The next time she came around after we got our food she didn't ask how our food was and never once did the entire time even though half of both of our plates were uneaten. That is possibly the first time a waitress or waiter has never asked how the food was. The burrito, honestly, I got a chorizo and egg burrito from circle k on a whim before work and it tasted about the same. Overall, one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. Maybe if we had a better waitress our experience would've been different, but that, mixed with the sub par food, long waits, and pretty expensive for not good food or service, made it just absolutely terrible.",0.0

Salmon Avocado (gluten-free) - The dish came with PLENTY of salmon pieces. For me, the salmon tasted and felt almost tuna-like because it was dry.

I'm only 32 so I'm not too old but this was way beyond my liking. Our waitress was good but our food and drinks took forever to arrive and we were starving. I wasn't impressed by the food at all and the drinks were ok. Our experience was highly overpriced and both my husband and I were left unimpressed. If you like the loud club scene with cool looking drinks then this is probably the place or you, but as for me, I will pass...",0.0

"I always go to the fry. I recently went to the other location north of Yonge but decided to try out this location near Sheppard. That was a total mistake! There was 5 of us today and it was really busy but we got a table pretty fast. We ordered and waited. While waiting I saw one of the waitresses go to a table and switch a customers basket of chicken as he was eating it. She said nothing and the customer looked so confused, and meanwhile I was still waiting for my order. Everyone at my table got their chicken and in less than a minute the girl who swapped the other persons chicken came back out with my food. I could tell right away that this was the same basket as the one she switched, because the chicken was all tossed around and the sesame seeds were underneath the chicken unlike every other persons basket at my table. What she did was disgusting as that guy was already eating the food she switched! I will not be going back to that location and will make sure my friends don't either.",0.0

"Apollo Inspections has done 2 inspections for me in the last 7 months and I recommend their services without any reservation.  The plot twist here is that 1 of the houses was a total failure and I had to cancel the deal.  THANK GAWD!!! 

To give some context, I'm a lawyer and have also practiced real estate in the Las Vegas community, so my expectations are high and, as a buyer, there's always so much at stake whether an investment or personal home.  The first home looked good to me and I was so excited to open escrow.  The deal didn't work out, thankfully, because Apollo Inspections found the foundation issues, cracks, and abnormal settling that would have been a lifetime of problems for me and no ability to successfully sell the property.  Apollo gave me the straight scoop and the ability to make an informed decision...

The process, detail, and transparent communication Apollo uses to ensure you are comfortable with your potential new home is invaluable. No matter your level of knowledge about these matters, Apollo's Peri & Billy will bring you along and explain things to you practically and give you the opportunity to make an informed decision about repairs, conditions, and everything else you need to know.  There are no dumb questions with these professionals.

I heard this place is famous and super popular and everyone always tell me to try it. i honestly was disappointed it just didn't taste like a Vietnamese sandwich to me. I waited forever for my sandwich and it was only slightly warm like they heated up in the microwave. The bread was really hard and super chewy. I got the grill pork sandwich but it felt like I was eating beef jerky cause the pork was so dry and hard. I wouldn't come back here if I wanted a Vietnamese sandwich or Vietnamese food. So I don't recommend coming here not worth the time to stop here or worth spending money for food that isn't freshly made.,0.0

"Bouncy World is an awesome place for my kids to let out some energy and allow their imaginations go to work. $11 per person for a full day pass to jump is more than reasonable especially when you have children that like to jump on your expensive leather couch at home. The BOUNCERS are CLEAN here! Also, they are free of the infamous, pungent foot odor these things are likely to have as a result of them not being properly maintained and cared for. The restrooms are CLEAN here too, which is great because I have a 4yr old that likes to lean against the toilet when he handles his business. 

We have walk-in parties for our boys (4yr and 5yr) every year and the managers and staff are always accomodating to our needs. We normally celebrate parties on a Saturday, but this place gets busy upon opening. I recommend anyone doing a walk-in on a Saturday to get here early or have parties during the start or middle of the week. You're allowed to bring cake and ice cream inside, but no other outside food or drink is allowed. 

The food offered here is good. Everything on the menu are foods they bake in their pizza oven. My expectation of the pizza during our first visit was low, but it turned out to be better than a lot of pizza take out restaurants I've had around town. Kids love the chicken fingers. Pizza, fingers and wings are moderately priced. Snacks and drinks are inexpensive. 

I always see one of the owners\/managers making rounds around the bouncers. The staff here are very attentative to the surroundings so children don't hurt themselves. I would advise parents to supervise their children when they are bouncing with other kids because accidents happen (...and if you're my youngest and incredibly clumsy son, accidents will happen all the time). 

In closing, this place is awesome. I will continue to bring my kids to Bouncy World so long as they continue to keep they're standards up...and also to save my couch.",0.0

"I don't do too many reviews and especially negative ones but I worked in high end restaurants throughout college and consider myself a bit of a foodie. Overall experience was lackluster. Ambience was good but service and dishes were not. Given we did come in as a family of 5 with kids 8,10 and 13 so the young server tried to rush us out. With the greeting of the table he wanted to take a drink order, apps, and entree immediately. I had to ask for the specials. Clam app was overly salty and pooled in grease. Spicy lobster bisque was not spicy at all and actually pretty bland. Kale strawberry salad was great. Entrees came out 45 min later and ranged from hot to room temp to sat in the window for a while. Sea bass was great but the fried porteballos that topped the dish were obviously pre-cooked and cold. Chicken Marsala was cold.  It was re-made and came out hot this time but was so saturated with overly thick sweet sauce over soggy spinach it was inedible.  Honestly tasted more like orange chicken than Marsala. Brussel sprout side dish had good flavor but cold and greasy. My two boys enjoyed the buttered noodles and Alfredo. I didn't have the heart to call out that the Alfredo was broken with a pool of butter under the pasta. I will say that they took off the sprouts and chicken Marsala but we still paid well over $300. I was very much looking forward to this dinner all week and was very disappointed.

I got a bun (vermicelli) with pork and an egg roll. It was great. Also got sweet potato fries, but they didn't have anything for them like honey mustard or glaze. Just ketchup. Its American food at a Vietnamese place, I think it's out of place. I mean that's not that big of a deal but it just seems like they need some more time to get things organized. They where missing small things like splenda and sweet and lo packets at the tables, the honey mustard, and just little stuff. I say in a month they'll be ready.

Only negative thing was that we booked them on pretty short notice and they wanted us to get a ton of blown attic insulation taken out before starting the job. They didn't seem to realize that no insulation place in town could do this with less than 4-6 weeks lead time and then underestimated how much time it would take my husband to DIY it. Pro tip: insulation removal is awful and it's best to pay others to do this. But this was, in the long term, a minor thing and we're very happy with Cardinal and will continue to use them for our heating and cooling needs.",0.0

As far as complaints, do you think I would still let you guys touch my car after all the swirl marks and scratches you did to my car? No, THANK YOU. I headed home and spent hours polishing them out. I use a dual action polisher, and professionals only use dual action polisher or rotary polisher. High speed polisher? Do you mean the ones you can buy in Walmart or AutoZone? I will upload the result and the receipt to prove that I came today. Why would I make complaint? To let you guys fcuk up my car again? Or do you think I would want my $10 dollars back? Hell no, I do not even have time to argue with you guys to get my money back. $10 bought me a lesson, never be lazy to wash my own car ever again... Your standards may be high, but definitely not your workers. 


They scratched my car not only swirl but also real scratch they bend the cable of the air blower on my car. And you may ask, how could you know if those weren't there before they washed my car? Well, I just polished my car two days ago using two step polish, I removed all the swirls, I know what I'm doing and it is a 2015 car! They are okay if you want to polish your car after they wash it.",0.0

"I read great things about this place so I really wanted to rate it highly, however, our first impression was not a fantastic one. It took a while for someone to take our order and then we waited another half hour to get our food. I was semi-hungry when I walked in, but starving when my food finally came. Sorta worked out I guess. The waiting was not fun though, especially see other people's food arrive faster than ours. Their ramen is quite good, so I'll give it that. I only wish it came with more toppings for the base like some other places. I think our server switched halfway and the second lady was a lot efficient in serving us. The bill arrived promptly, or at least quicker than our food. I don't really see the hype over this place. May or may not be back.",0.0

"I'll start by saying the inside was very chic and the staff seemed very helpful and friendly.  However, the food itself was a little bit of a disappointment.  I got the CA Rolls and they reminded me of the pre-made rolls at the grocery store.  I expected a lot more from a place that has the word, ""fin"" in their name.  At any rate the rolls were dry and pretty tasteless; they seemed pre-made.  I also got the deep-fried avocado, which looked amazing, but the crispy deep-fried skin to soft avocado ratio was a little off for me.  There came a point where it felt like you're just eating an avocado, which I suppose could be awesome given your taste.  All-in-all though my biggest issue was with the fish.  For a place that has fish listed in a majority of their menu, the expectations should be higher.",0.0
"Had one of the absolute worst experiences ordering delivery from here with the Yelp eat24 app. I was really excited to try this place when the menu showed gluten free calzones, which i haven't had in a long time and usually love. I ordered around 6:20-630pm and was disappointed that it showed a delivery time of 720 but we had already picked everything out and paid before we could see that. 20min later i get a call saying they don't have gluten free calzones and asked if i was okay with a regular one. Of course not! Why would i pay extra for gluten free if i could have regular? They didn't offer any other solution. So i asked if they had gluten free pizza crusts, which they did bit said it usually costs more
And wouldn't charge me the extra $1. It's like what are you talking about i already paid for the gluten free up charge with my calzone order. Then 740 rolls around and no call and the app still showed the pizza arriving at 720. So i call and they said oh yeah it should be out soon. We got a lot of orders after yours and got slammed. No excuse for not even a courtesy call or apology. Had to call again when by 820 still no food. Same story. Finally got it around 846 and it was chewy and lukewarm. Terrible. Never ordering from here again. P.s. My husband and brother had pizzas too and said they also were really bad.",0.0

Decided to treat ourselves and yelped best breakfast and after scrolling  and scrolling we came across this gem! So glad we did and didn't keep scrolling because everyone says it's crowded with a wait. We knew we would have to wait and it actually wasn't that bad at all! The 20-25 minutes flew by and we were seated and excited to order! I indulged in the pictured Blackberry French Toast with a side of eggs and bacon and a coffee.....all were simply AMAZING!!!! That French Toast was huge and sooooo so very delicious...of course I couldn't finish it. The coffee was so mellow and great as well...great flavor! My husband ordered the Banana Pecan Pancakes with a side of eggs, sausage and home fries....he was so very impressed! Absolutely delicious! The home fries could have been a little more crispy to his liking but they had great flavor and were still yummy! He had the fresh squeezed OJ and although not a fan of pulp he still loved it over some ice and it was awesome that it comes with one free refill which was perfect. My 4yr old killed her kids pancakes and bacon...I never seen her eat so much for breakfast and washed it down with organic apple juice.

If you need some direction on what to try, give the Smokey Mountain a go. I find it to be better without onion; may just be my own preference. A cup of tomato bisque soup compliments it nicely.

"Soco is a cute spot connected to the Delta Hotel. I liked that the menu was quite simple. I tried the mac and cheese with braised beef and a friend had the burger with fries. After 10pm, the dinner menu turns into a late night snack menu, where portions are smaller, but prices remain the same. Before going to Soco, I've read many reviews and had high expectations for their award-winning mac and cheese. I was not disappointed. I think adding the braised beef makes the dish sooo much better. The mac and cheese is REALLY heavy and cheesy. And thats why I would not complain about the portion size being smaller than their drink glass. Adding a fresh element or even a tiny side salad would help cut the amount of fat you can literally feel yourself consuming. (Not complaining, this dish would satisfy any mac and cheese craving for months!)

The prices are on par with most other Scottsdale locations, a little bit on the pricier side. I had the Dutch Apple French Toast ($12 after tax).

There was only 2 of us and there were 3 servers who passed us. Second, we had waited about 10 minutes for someone to even acknowlege we were there. Third, getting a server to come take an order took another 10 minutes. Food was good. Fries came warm enough, not hot. It was crispy. So I had lost my glasses there that night. Called for it Friday. Spoke to someone and they had said it was there. Come Saturday night...tonight, and they cannot find it. Told me to look in the lost and found box. Its one thing to say its there, and its one thing to say its not there. The servers are not quite friendly. But food was good.",0.0

Took it back again for a second examination,  tech claimed it there was missing parts and blah blah blah with all the excuses.  After all, they were the first ones to opened up the Ipad.  They have no technical knowledge at all.  so the second time I got it back,  the iPad wouldn't even turn On.  Spoke with owner,  he denied all responsibilities.

"Its a small cafe, we went for dessert and coffee. The cakes were pretty good, we ordered a carrot cake and triple c (too mushy). The coffee is ""bottom less"" but it took lots of effort to get a refill and milk. The waitress\/waiter gave us our coffee and asked if we needed milk to which we said yes. She never back.

He didn't come back until we waved him down but still forgot the milk. 3rd guy comes and asks of we need a refill, he doesn't come back ...

Nice to know that they have high-chairs and are family friendly, ready to clean up after your messy kids. 

Had the pumpkin pancakes... and oh boy, they not only were hearty, but there were five? six? full-on pancake with the walnuts and chantilly cream. And they were drenched in syrup. Not that I'm complaining, I just felt terrible that I could only eat half of the meal.

The Fritatta was also good, nice and eggy, with lots of fresh ingredients. My guy and I shared the healthy pastry (a small mini loaf that was delish!) as an appetizer, but we were both struggling to finish our individual meals, and I rarely see this guy struggle when it comes to food. 

Honestly, I think if the portions were a wee bit smaller, or if I knew how heavy the pancakes were going to be, I would have had a better time.

"One of the worst meals I have ever had. I ordered delivery through Grubhub and wished I hadn't. 

Ordered shrimp and vegetable tempura, crunchy caterpillar roll, and Singapore noodles. 

The tempura smelled and tasted like it was made with onion ring batter. So heavy and greasy. Nothing like tempura. 

The avocado on top of the crunchy caterpillar roll was completely brown, I couldn't even bring myself to eat it, I took it off and ate the roll without it. Well, the few pieces I could stomach, it wasn't good at all. 

The Singapore noodles were just ok. They only have chicken (no pork or shrimp like usual) and after the tempura and roll, I was frankly too scared to even try the chicken. The noodles were either the wrong noodles or overcooked (thicker than they usually are). The flavor wasn't bad.

"Very low budget.  The hotel will nickel and dime you to death.  We arrived at 12:45pm on a Wednesday and was informed check in was at 1pm and it would be an extra $20 to check in early or go to the kiosk to check in. The kiosk area was a complete zoo as is the Lobby area. Oh they did offer us $10 off if we declined housekeeping services during our stay.  Really???  Then to get to our room we had to pass the time share folks who are trying to sell you every time you walk by.  Seriously!!! WTH!!! The casino is out of date and the rooms even more out of date. The bathroom in our room was tiny and the shower pressure was horrible. There are two pools one that blasts loud music and the family pool where you can still hear the loud music thumping from the party pool. By the way, it was a Wednesday and Thursday.  I can understand doing the party pool on the weekends but for the love of God give it a rest during the weekdays.  Check out is 11am asked for a 12pm check out but that of course is an extra $20.  Basically, this hotel caters to the young kids on a budget.  I could have stayed at Treasure Island for the same price and it's much nicer, more modern and has great customer service.  Unfortunately I wanted to try a different hotel and was not happy at all. Avoid the Flamingo Hotel.",0.0

The burrito was very small, definitely not a burrito to share; and priced similarly to a chipotles burrito, with the size of a Taco Bell burrito.

Smoke Shack Ham - served with lovely little pancakes. This was a delicious meat. 

Mains:
Zampone - a pigs foot stuffed with charcuterie and served with a maple glaze. Very rich. A delicacy which will induce a happy food coma. 

Duck in a Can - the most underwhelming item we tried. It was not that flavorful and was a bit mushy.

"This lash Solon is do beautiful!  Being honest, my first set was not phenomenal. The reason I'm giving 5 stars is because the owner Shauna personally called me and set me up with another lash specialist to get me fixed up.  Today Kaitlyn did my lashes and they look amazing!  She did a thorough consultation before getting started and gave me exactly what I wanted.  I can't say enough about the way that Shauna runs her business, I will definitely be back.",0.0

It doesn't get better than here. Love! Love! Love! Be prepared to receive some on the house dishes which are very nice. Usually they're small tempura vegetables or diced salmon. The waitresses are very friendly, they even walk you out when you leave the restaurant! I would definitely recommend this place.",0.0
"Our garage door broke down just after the holidays. We thought that it would just need  a quick and easy mending because we saw a missing screw in one of the brackets that's why the motor opener can't open it fully without human assistance. We reckon that fixing and tuning up the latter will only cost us around a $100 but we limit our budget up to $200 total. Since we just spent quite a some this past holidays. My wife was lucky enough to contact them but was unlucky to know that the spring were broken and needed replacement according to Allan their very nice technician. But unfortunately replacing them with a much better system would blow our budget. In a nutshell, Isaac, the overall manager of the company in Las Vegas was able to bend over backwards ""big time""! And was able to accommodate us and replace the spring system with an unbeatable price and warranty for the system. 
So, if you are honestly on a very tight and limited budget for a garage door service, worry no more! Because this company will work out what is best for you and your budget. I can count with only the fingers of 1 hand that I dealt with before with such an outstanding customer service that really cares and understands their customers such as A1 Garage Door Services! They are not only no.1 in the business, but no.1 in our hearts. God bless Isaac and Allan! Thank you very much guys!",0.0

Zapatas...where have you been all my life?! I somehow had not tried this place but was pleasantly surprised Saturday when we came in for dinner. The decor reminds me of some restaurants in Mexico and the interior is huge! I love the fun vibes and the bar looks great. We were seated and I ordered the Saturday special margarita which had cranberry juice in it. It was a little sweet for my taste but still tasty. The chips were warm and the salsa was great. I ordered the fajita chimichanga which was smothered in queso and was marvelous. We will definitely be back. Our service was timely and friendly. We had a great time!,0.0
"In Vegas for a conference and was dying to get away from the casino's and the overpriced crap. My sister, a Las Vegas local, told me we were getting Thai and picked me up. Just down the street from where I'm staying, the price was cheap, the portions were large and the food was fantastic.

"I was looking for a family doctor in the area and I consider myself lucky to be paired with Dr Kassam, who specializes in women's health which I appreciate!

The clinic is accessible by transit (501 streetcar or replacement bus) and also has underground parking. When I first requested an appointment, I came in for a general meeting which was described to me as a 'meet and greet'. Frankly, this is becoming the norm for most doctors, so people need to just accept that this is a fact of life. I had a similar experience with an up & coming doctor in Ottawa (perhaps this is the new school)? I know some people see it as a cash grab, but frankly, I'd rather give someone the run down about my medical history instead of chancing it.

In my first meeting, Dr Kassam was thorough in her questions with me and we discussed my medical background. She is incredibly attentive, friendly, and motivated. We discussed where I was in my life & what I saw for myself in the future. She ordered a basic blood workup and updates on some shots I was out of date on. The bloodwork was done on the spot in the clinic. I noticed the last time that I went, they are now only scheduling appointments for blood work. I think it was at that appointment that they weighed and measured me, too.

I've only had one referral to another specialist, and Dr. Kassam had cautioned me that it was a difficult place to get into. She did her magic and got me an appointment, with an 8-9 month lead time. I just got an email from the specialist in question providing my appointment slot. Again...hate to say it, but that's kind of the norm in Ontario's medical system. Luckily, my issue can wait. 

I've raised multiple concerns during appointments without issue. At my last appointment, I asked for a script refill (no problem) & asked for feedback about some changes I want to make. Dr Kassam was happy to respond to my questions.

Regarding appointments, I've had no issues booking follow up appointments via email, which I find easier because I dislike sitting on the phone. I simply identify myself as a patient of Dr. Kassam's, suggest a date and time, and it's almost always been accommodated.",0.0
"Jay is fantastic. We have two bikes that had been outside and neglected for seven years. We called Jay and he got right back to us. He came over and got both bikes back in probably better than new shape. Great work at a great price and we didn't have to go anywhere. No loading up the bikes. No waiting at a bike shop. No waiting a week or more to have them worked on. No huge bill when they were done. It couldn't have been more convenient. Jay is a master bike mechanic. Our bikes are a fairly unusual German brand, but Jay knew all about them and had worked on the brand before. We can't recommend Jay highly enough.",0.0
"It's been a while since I've been to an Arby's but I was suckered into stopping by after seeing a commercial promoting their French Dip (yum!) and I gotta say I was pleasantly surprised by the presentation and taste here, not smooshed or thrown together, and the meat was as fresh as fast food can be. I would also recommend their Market fresh sandwiches, the quality of the ingredients are often better than what I have from the store at home. 
The building is pretty washed out\/old and there are usually not more than 2 cars in the parking lot so it looks closed down or abandoned but give this place a shot.

I didn't know any of the staff but when I lived just around the corner I never had an issue eating dinner at 9:30. Maybe they just don't care anymore and would rather go home early than do their jobs.

"It's alright. We ordered a small cookie crunch to share and it was more than enough. The cookie butter ice cream actually had a great flavor and tasted exactly like Trader Joe's cookie butter. However, it looked a lot like shredded chicken and the texture was odd. I guess because I expected it to have the texture of shredded chicken. It basically just melts immediately and you suck on an ice sheet for awhile. The reason I wouldn't give this place more stars is the toppings are sort of weak. Graham cracker crunched up and chocolate sauce? Feels like something I made as an after school snack in middle school. Fro yo places have better variety. I just think the set menu items could be a little more creative.",0.0

I ordered their Lobster fra diavolo. It was so good. I ate leftovers for two days. The sauce was delicious, their was plenty of seafood along with the linguini, and it was great quality.

Particularly noteworthy are: the octopus, served on a bed of white bean puree, perfectly cooked every time; artichokes with romesco and prosciutto and the roasted beets with labne, cashew and microgreens. The salt cod fritters are also not to be missed--crispy on the outside, light in texture with a wonderful briny flavor.  Save room for dessert--they are all delicious, but the panna cotta is a knockout. Kudos to Chef Andrew Hill on a great menu, very well executed.  

The wine list is perhaps the most interesting in the city. They've got an extensive selection by the bottle and a nicely curated by the glass list. They've got a great beer list, both bottle and on tap, as well. 

On two occasions there have been jazz performances in the main section of the restaurant. The first time, a Friday night, the atmosphere was very jazz clubby, which was fun. The second time (a Wednesday) the performance was a more ""sit and listen"" so conversation in the restaurant was more subdued.  In both cases, the music was great and added to our enjoyment of the food and wine.  

Several of the reviewers have noted issues with service, to be expected in a new restaurant as the front of house finds their legs. Over the course of several visits we've seen the problems shake out. Service as Casellula is understated, gracious and attentive.

As an aside, I've also had the pleasure of dining at Casellula in New York City. It's a terrific before or after theater choice. The atmosphere is bit more cozy, perhaps owing to the low ceilings and low lighting and, as a result, it feels a little more intimate. The menu offers the same type of small sharable plates, but different choices, except for the Pigs Ass sandwich, which appears on both menus. Casellula NYC offers but the same attentive service, the same great cheese.  

Casellula Alphabet City has become our ""go-to"" restaurant.  The best new opening in Pittsburgh--amidst a bunch of great options--in quite some time. We will be back!",0.0
The worst night club that has to be named lounge.the worst experience ever. Just blew my $100 bucks for nothing. What an overpriced overcrowded so call VIP section lounge chairs that fill up the place. Payed $ 54.50 for 2 people. $37 for two drinks. You could not even dance because the lounge chairs. I'm sorry but even a  Latin club in NY blows this place away. I will never go back. If you like to dance look for something els.  No stars for me very disappointed.

"I've been here twice and have had great experiences both times. I live in the building it is in, so with it being convenient as well, it doesn't get any better. The first time I came for a drink & light dinner. I got a rum & coke ($6) and marghertia pizza ($12) one day after work. Very satisfying. I sat at the bar & the bartender was great. The next time I came was for Sunday brunch. I got a peach Bellini (they have unlimited bellinis or mimosas for $15, but I just wanted one) and the fettuccini. Really good. The serving was small, but it was very filling. Very cute place with great drinks & good food. If I had a critique, it would be to have a separate price for people who only want one brunch drink. $15 for 1 Bellini is kinda ridiculous.",0.0
"I was asked the other day why many of the places I go to happen to be in the East end or downtown Toronto and quite frankly it's where I live and where I frequent the most.  They asked why I'm never in the west end so a few days ago, I did travel over there to check out some west end's best.  One of the places I went into was Ravi Soups on Queen Street West.  I actually had driven past a couple of these restaurants on my way there and some of the back seat drivers were telling me that it was one of the best soup places in the city.  So naturally once I finally got to my final destination, ironically a Ravi Soup Restaurant just happened to be down the road from where I was, so conveniently it was the place to go.

There was plenty of side street parking and when we went in, we could see that there were about 10 tables available.  If one ordered their individual wraps or soups, it would have cost one approximately $8.99 however if you paid $2.00 more, one could get both a wrap and soup.  Naturally, the combo was the way to go so I went and ordered the Curried Lamb wrap and the Porcini Mushroom Wild Rice Bisque. My friends also order a combo and went with the Flank Steak Wrap and Squash Soup.

The squash soup was very tasty and the squash was perfectly pureed so that it was not too watered down and not too thick.  Adding some crispy strips of shallot gave it that garlicky and salty taste to it while also adding an Asian pear gave it a slightly sweet flavor to it.  The yin-yang effect really made this soup stand out and hit every taste bud in the mouth while tasting this wonderful soup.

The meat for the curried lamb was a little dry for me however the taste was there.  I can understand the reasons why it might have been drier than normal because one would not want to eat a soggy wrap if that was the case.  The porcini mushroom wild rice bisque was very well done.  The mushroom was minced into very small pieces and the taste was amazing.  It definitely had all the true tastes of a fresh mushroom soup put together. I also added some black pepper into the soup just for some extra flavor but honestly one probably didn't even need it because it tasted just perfect on its own.

The flank steak wrap was a little bit more juicier than the lamb.  The steak had some green vegetables wrapped around it and had some sort of sauce that made the overall wrap much more juicier.  If I had to choose between the steak and the lamb, I'd probably lean on the steak more.  The aroma was quite evident and the steak tasted great.  

It was probably one of the more pleasant surprises that I have had in quite some time.  Walking into a restaurant on a complete whim and coming out extremely happy with the service and with the overall quality of the food.  Based on my experience here at this Ravi Soup restaurant, I know for sure I would not hesitate to visit some of the other locations if I happened to be driving by.  If you haven't tried this place yet, certainly go in and give it a try.",0.0

"We stopped in for lunch and we were the only table in there but the service was subpar. They have one server who takes care of the bar and the restaurant so she's just not available.

When the bill came it was $60 I checked out the bill and the pizza was priced at $18. Granted I should have looked but when my daughter ordered the pizza I had a general idea based on industry standards what the price would be..... and $18 wasn't even in the ballpark so I was shocked. This pizza was just a very thin pizza on what looked to be some kind of Frozen flatbread crust it was nothing fancy at all. When the server came I asked her if that was a mistake or was that the price and she said "" yeah it's a Red's pizza so that's how much it costs"" I don't mind paying good money for good food and good service but we got neither one of these

The falafel pita was super delicious and as expected, extremely filling. The falafel was flavorful, crunchy without being too crispy, and well balanced against the veggies in the pita. I would definitely get this a second time! The spanakopita was also good, savory without being salty or overwhelming. Service was amazing and our server really made our overall experience great!

We sat upstairs in a room that had three tables, but wish we had sat outside (that's our mistake, not theirs though) Had two drinks, their version of a Manhattan (The Bostic) was terrific, smokey and delicious. Wife had the Local Honey which was very tasty and the server recommended a glass of wine after finding out what type of wine my wife liked. Had the beet carpaccio for an appetizer, which was very good if a bit of a small portion, but it was very fresh and bright. I ordered the elk chop which was EXCELLENT and a must-get if you're there, wife ordered the lobster thermidor which was very good as well.

"How best to put this? 
The atmposhere, decor, and seating gives a unique vibe to Salisbury Arms, but what they have in decor they lack in other areas.

-The Menu-
It gives off the vibe of attempting to be ""fancy"", I think would be the appropriate word. A dish better described as Deep-fried Cod and Chips, was ""House-battered free line Cod"". Perhaps they were attempting to appeal to the hipster crowd, but it loses points with me, overdescribing an inevitably simple dish.

-The Food-
I ordered said Cod, when it came to me, it was on a thing rectangular plate, the cod was, simply put, over-battered. Like an archaelogist, I had to excavate away the outer layers, just to get to the Cod. Now, I'm an American, we Americans love our fried food, we also know when enough batter is enough, as all that spare batter holds on to grease like nobodies business, causing it to become just a fried greaseball. The plating looked pleasant, aside from that mountain of batter (exaggerating), the chips hoisting up Mt. Codinminjaro ended up absorbing some of the grease, leaving them softer than normal. The fries, incidentally, still tasted great, and were not over-seasoned. 
Also, Minty Pea puree? Mushy peas is fine with me, no need to add mint, it didn't really add to the experience for me.

Throw in that tiny plate, and there wasn't room to cut through the fish without breaking bits of batter off the plate.


-The Drinks-

A good selection, I'm still dismayed I can't find a good Porter or Stout in Edinburgh, but that's nothing against this restaurant. I ordered the Thistly Cross Elderflower Cider, which is great, I recommend it. 
---
Overall, it wasn't bad, there's some improvements to be made, but the decor, and the overall feel of the place seems to be great for a small group to sit back, relax, and have a few drinks. It is definitely worth sitting back and having drinks, but order light on the food.

We were sat by hostess, a guy (not our server) brought chips n salsa. Waitress finally came by took drink order. We asked for two ice waters. We got to bottom of chips and still no water. I seen the manager (blonde) walking around greeting guests. I got up and asked her for the waters. She aplogised and said she would be right over with the waters. Never happened. Finally our waitress came over and was like oh I forgot your drinks, What did you order? We finally got our water after 20 mins. Then she came back and took our order. When we got our food a different waiter brought it out our food and it was great!! Then we didn't see our waitress for another period of time. When we finally did see her again she was hanging out with the manager chatting. I had to go up and ask for our check. So twice I had to get up and ask for something.

Got a few drinks at the rooftop deck and ended up staying for about 3 1\/2 hours - it is a really great experience up there. We headed upstairs at about 1030 at night and decided to eat.  At first I was a little disappointed in the lack of choices on the menu, until I realize that what they had, they did well. I tried for the five meatballs that they had that night along with the side and all were very good. We decided to head back on Monday evening as well and realize that they had two dollar meatball sliders. This night I again tried several of the meatballs and several of the sauces the chicken meatball is very good!  The ambience of the place is pretty neat- a good time!",0.0

Worst staff ever they set up ADA seating but did not allow my disabled mother to sit there due to staff discretion according to staff my mother needed to have a walker or wheelchair in order to sit there!

They cook the kababs and falafels after you place your order. Once they are about to get ready you get to choose a bowl,wrap, or plate option.

"It wasnt terrible but there is a lot of room for improvement. Priced at $12\/person (kkds under 3 free = awesome) which is not that bad but I think the grounds could be better kept. There were spiders and webs on all the seating and most of the rails. The whole place is in a very woodsy area which is great for shade, and understandable about the spiders but I still think they should be swept off every morning. I also thought the bird cages were a little sad, pretty small and some werent easy to see the animals. (Most of the birds cant fly due to injuries so i get it) The eagle cage was a big let down.  Huge, beautiful birds but they were very far away. Theres a tiny little play area with natural wooden activities, which I love, but it was so blah.. again covered in spider webs, and just boring. I'd go back because my kids are very young and will still like it for a while but its not amazing.",0.0

"As a Texas boy I was interested in finding a spot that does brisket right, Saucemans did not disappoint. The brisket was very juicy and tender with a distinct smokey flavor. It did not need a sauce but I tried those anyway. I really like their smokey sauce it seems like it is made with just a few ingredients but it is very savory and just a touch of tangy goodness. Prices were reasonable for good BBQ. I got the brisket sandwich, a soda and a side of potato salad. It comes with red or white slaw and some fresh crunchy pickles as well. It was around $12 with everything. My only request that the sandwich have another few slices of brisket. I would of gladly paid $2 or $3 more for a larger portion. The slaw was good crunchy with a good vinegar tang. The potato salad was flavorful with a mustard base and some little bits of crunchy goodness.

"The restaurant was founded in 1968 by namesake Carolina Valenzuela, who still presides over the kitchen.   It was first at 105 W. Hilton Ave. and later at 1519 E. Mohave St.   Since 1986, it has been at 1202 E. Mohave in a building that also has housed a coin-operated laundry and a grocery store.
   
   No one is bothered by Carolina's vague pricing.   People just order what they want with the understanding that their tab, including a large, refillable drink, likely won't exceed $5.
   
   The tortillas, which are available by the dozen for takeout, are churned out by a crew of workers who stand before a bank of hot griddles, deftly flipping the paper thin rounds of dough and piling them up for packaging. 

   I am particularly partial to the soft-shell machaca taco.   It's a simple affair with a warm corn tortilla wrapped around a generous portion of the subtly spiced shredded beef filling.   It's a perfect starter before tackling the main course --- one of Carolina's incredible burros wrapped in a homemade flour tortilla.
   The plain bean burro is majestic; the green chile burro, marvelous; the red chile burro, legendary; but the Oaxaca special with beans, chorizo, potatoes and cheese is pure heaven.
   The rich, piquant flavor of the chorizo is enhanced by the cheese and potatoes and tempered by the beans and the chewy tortilla wrap.
   Carolina's burros can be ordered enchilada-style with red or green sauce, lettuce and cheese, or deep-fried like a chimichanga.

This time, they had a Schnitzel Fest (mid-August to mid-September); in addition to having a bunch of mostly meat entrees that they don't normally have in the $17-21 range, you could also pay $28 for one of those plus goulash \/ soup of the day and a dessert (choice of Apple Strudel, Linzer Torte, and some chocolate torte whose name I do not remember). A good value when you consider the value of that soup is $5 alone, and the dessert could be just as much if not more, so as long as you got something over $18, you were getting a good deal. It was a little peculiar that on the day that we were there (a Monday afternoon), they were out of both goulash (one of the two options for the soup on this Schnitzel Fest thing) and sweet potato fries... As far as the food goes, I got the Apricot Schnitzel with a Cream of Carrot with Curry Soup and the Linzer Torte. The schnitzel came with steamed veggies (zucchini, carrot, asparagus, some white root thing that frankly I have no idea what it was) and roasted potatoes, as well as an apricot cognac sauce on top. Soup was very flavourful, good texture (little gritty), and fairly filling. The meat was well-cooked (not deep-fried), and the potatoes were excellent. A minor critique is that some potatoes were harder and seemed a bit undercooked; this would not have been as noticeable if they were all of that consistent hardness. Steamed vegetables were well done, if not that flavourful. The apricot sauce is light and sweet but not overly so. That being said, I'm not sure that it was much of a complement either than perhaps to mask any potential dryness of the meat (a little but well done overall). The torte was alright. I don't typically eat fancy cakes, so let that stand as a disclaimer. I found it to be a bit dry and hard. The raspberry was relatively minor and not a dominant flavor. The sauce (which included three raspberry hearts...) was good and helped to mitigate some of that, but frankly the cake was so dense that it didn't even really soak up the sauce if you dragged it through. 

Price: Perhaps a bit steep. The presentation of the food is very good, but as with most expensive places, it's totally non-functional. Like putting the schnitzel on top of the potatoes was pointless because I had to take it off to eat anyway. The value of the raw ingredients for what I had (for the main course) couldn't have been anymore than $12 (pork cutlet + a few veggies and taters), but it was a $21 pricetag. That soup probably wasn't worth $5 either. I have no idea what was in that cake, so I can't comment on that. 

In my opinion, it is difficult for any place where an entree exceeds $18 (+\/- $2) to get 5 stars because if I'm paying that much, it better be really good (exceptions include steakhouses). Certainly this is a good restaurant, and the food is pretty good, but as some others have noted, sometimes the flavours are too light to be memorable. It's like the difference between being just consistently above average and being great. Service is fine; our guy seemed pretty new, so he got confused about a few things; no biggie though. Also note that it can sometimes get a bit loud during peak hours.",0.0
I ordered one drink and instead got the game changer the most expensive drink on the list. The service was terrible. I asked for a suggestion on which drink and was told anything on the menu. The guy policing the outside was really rude,0.0

"For sure these guys are all about customer service. Jason and Chris are very nice, professional and do care about our vehicle. They called to check on things weeks after the vehicle was in their shop. This auto repair shop gets two thumbs up and I will refer friends and family.

"In the words of Mr. Peabody, adequate but hardly extraordinary. 

I did relish placing my order with the cashier, ""I'll have a slut please."" Too easy, I know. I kept a straight face. After picking it up I found one of the few seats remaining and sat down. Across from me were three rotund black women, all enjoying their own breakfasts as well. The lady in the middle asked me what I was eating? 

""A slut,"" I answered. 

""I bet you didn't know you was gonna eat one,"" and she began to laugh. As did I. She had me there. 

Ok, this is fast food done reasonably well. You can ignore all the reviews about it costing too much. Tell me something that doesn't in this town. You come here to have fun; never mind the cost. Having said this, Eggslut might have opted for the small Mason jar instead of the teeny-weenie size. But they are selling plenty of them so don't imagine they will be upsizing anytime soon.  Or maybe a larger jar would require two eggs to get the egg-potato ratio just right. So then charge more (not that I know anything about the restaurant business).

The slut doesn't seem to be mashed potatoes with a soft boiled egg, but rather just potatoes cooked right, pur√©ed, chives and salt added. Potatoes could have been a little warmer. Egg properly coddled. All in all, it was good enough. 

Did also have the biscuits--okay but not perfect. But you might like them. 

Not sure I'd go out of my way for Eggslut, but in the neighborhood? Sure.",0.0
"Had a great visit to the BKB. First off, we had very attentive service. We sat outside, and it was still pretty chilly. One of the staff came out immediately and asked if we wanted the space heater on, which was nice. 
First warning - my wife and I like to try a variety of items off any menu, and ordered several things to share. The difficult part is that the portions are massive!  My wife had the breakfast burrito, which she loved. It's easily enough for two people. I had the breakfast sandwich, which also was huge. It also could have fed two. It had eggs, bacon, cheese, avocado and mashed potato hash browns with aioli on a brioche bun. It was delicious. We also ordered a churro waffle, which we asked to be boxed one with we saw how much food we had. We had the waffle later, and it was amazing. It really was more like dessert than breakfast. Simply fabulous.

WORST OPTICAL EXPERIENCE EVER!!
The $29 ""free"" exam fee- for a BOTCHED EXAM - was not returned to me after I HAD to RETURN glasses, due to the WRONG PRESCRIPTION being dispensed from THEIR OPTOMETRIST.
Altho the place AT FIRST GLANCE appears clean, all the frames I tried on needed at least periodical cleaning, lenses were visibly FILTHY, and within 2 days after trying on (and buying) 1 pr frames from there, I developed a skin infection where frames contact point is (where ear attaches to head.)
When I initially went to pick up the finished glasses, I could see through the 1 lens out of 2 that seemed to be correct prescription; I had also NOT been informed that these smaller frames would""squish"" my progressive prescription into tiny space, as the whole progressive prescription needs top to bottom room enough to fit into a frame properly. I hoes this helps someone with a progressive prescription to pick large enough frames for their prescription.
The dispensary employee- who actually came to work to dispense glasses to people, WITH PINKEYE from their child- told me to ""try them on 1st thing in the morning,"" that my eyes would adjust. Tried that, it was a WRONG prescription.
And guess what?? I GOT PINKEYE!, which is highly contagious and required antibiotic eyedrops to cure.
MY frames were returned to me 3 MONTHS LATER, WITHOUT ANY clear plastic lenses, making them not returnable to the frame company. It was very difficult to reach an employee at corporate to straighten things out, ""customer service"" phone number automatically put me on permahold, then cut the call off at the 20 minute mark. I tried this 3 times, same result. 
After emails with a corporate employee, I had to FIGHT to get back ONLY PART of what I spent. They insist on keeping the $29 for exam fee, because I did not end up accepting their incorrect results.

"I got a ride from mccarran airport from Johannes Biniam with yellow checker star cab, I got out of the vehicle and he asked how I wanted to pay, I said credit card, he told me he would run the car himself, took my card and asked me if I wanted a receipt (especially because I wanted to see what he did tip wise) and I saw that he gave himself a tip which is illegal. The cab company at first offered me a full refund yesterday because what the driver did was illegal, but they only refunded the tip. I need to figure out where the uber pickup is in the future.",0.0

"Took my little Yorkshire Terrier pupper here a few weeks back. I have a very shy dog who does not enjoy interacting with new people. Finding him a groomer has been difficult over the years and you can tell whether the dog has or has not enjoyed their experience upon picking them up. The staff at Second Tub was very kind and accommodating of his shy nature. I got the full spa package, they took up to 3 hours but upon arrival I found myself looking at a completely new dog! They gave him exactly the cut I requested. My only complaint would be the prices.. they are simply too high. $90 for a full groom? For a small dog? Aside from this, it was a great experience. If you have the money, ""treat cho dog""!",0.0
