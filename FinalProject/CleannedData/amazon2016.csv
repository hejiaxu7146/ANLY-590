"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price.

"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do.

If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network.

Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets.

"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine.

"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc).

I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!,0.0,1.0,2016.0

"I previously owned a Samsung Tab3. As a media device (for reading, viewing, listening, playing), the HD8 is fine, even a step up in screen size, clarity, and ease of navigation.

Since I didn't buy it for its work capabilities, that's fine, but I think that would be annoying to a specific segment of potential users.

A lot of this is free for Prime Members. Good idea and business move for Amazon as it encourages Amazon content and purchases. The tablet itself is pretty good, smaller and more narrow than an iPad. Easy to hold in one hand, screen is nice for video, reading, web surfing and email. If the iPad is setting the bar and is a 10, I would give this an 7-8.

"First, I would like to say I own iPads, iPhone, and many things Apple. Second, I also own many android devices. The main reason for this tablet was to take advantage of the lending library that comes Amazon prime. Over all I would purchase this over an iPad mini any day just for the value alone. At first I thought the display wouldn't be up to snuff compared to my iPad, but for movies and reading, it was good enough that it doesn't take away from the experience. However, there are a few annoying ""features"" that are on but can and should be turned off. The ""on-deck"" is a great feature, but I would have liked to have known it was downloading tons of movies in the background, eating up space and bandwidth. A better function would have been to let us choose what to download, instead of getting movies Willynilly. Be sure to turn this off when you get your tablet or it will run slow, and you'll be thinking the tablet is slow. Ok on to kindle for reading. Unfortunately, reading isn't as great as I thought it would be because it doesn't allow scrolling. Works on kindle devices but not on kindle fire devices. If you don't mind flipping the page, then you won't have a problem, but for me, can read much faster by scrolling. One last point, most of the apps aren't as polished under the ""Amazon Store"" as in the Google play store. I know this because I have an Nexus phone and compared them. For example, the Hue app doesn't even work from Amazon Store. Anyway, this point shouldn't deter you from buying it cause there are solutions.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"The new design, compared to my old kindle paperwhite and voyage, looked weird when I first got my Kindle Oasis. After I used it for a while (5 hours), I felt the design was kind of make sense. When I hold it with one hand (right hand), the centre of gravity position was right in my hand, so there was less change that I drop the kindle on my face(when I was laying on my bed, it happened a lot with my kindle voyage)",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I would definitely buy it again, but it does not have the ambient light sensor like the cheaper voyage does to turn the brightness up and down automatically in the dark or sun.

It's light, very well lit, comfortable to hold both in the case and out of it. The buttons improve the page turning experience, I see no dark areas on my screed from the LED lights, it holds a great battery charge (true not as good as my previous Kindle, but I still generally get around 3 weeks between charges), and it looks absolutely beautiful.

"There's no doubt that this is the best Kindle device available. The battery life is astonishing, and the design is unique and extremely ergonomic. Holding this in your hand is such a pleasurable experience, it fits like a glove. So what are the cons you may ask...For one, the battery life depends on the provided case. It acts like a travel charger in a sense. Why a con? Well, it limits your customization options. And there's no way to purchase other colors or replacements for it at this time. So, you best be cautious with it.And two, the price obviously! But if you take into account that you basically are given a premium case, the device itself is a premium device, and you have a traveling charge inside the case...It may almost even out. But a $290-$350 device is hard to justify when it's just for reading.Still would recommend to any fan of e-readers/reading",1.0,1.0,2016.0
Nice device. But only minimally better than the Voyage.,1.0,1.0,2016.0
"'ve owned the Kindle Keyboard, 2nd generation Paperwhite and now the Oasis. I love the Oasis very much. The ergonomic design is wonderful and makes it a breeze to hold. It is so light -- that is the biggest killer feature of the Oasis. The 10 LEDs look fantastic and I love the return of page buttons. I've never had one where the screen is flush with the bezel so this is great. All in all, this is easily the best Kindle ever made and even though it's a bit spendy, it will be the one future Kindles are measured against.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I have had every kindle since the first and this is by far the best. The screen was already great on the Voyage but the front light on this screen is more white and more evenly distributed. Physical page turn buttons are so much better than none or the haptic feedback type. They didn't include the automatically adaptive front light for some reason but I don't think I'll miss it much as I was always wont to fiddle with it on the Voyage anyway.But this device made me smile as soon as I held it for the first time because it has a larger bezel that you can really grip comfortably without touching the screen. Maybe this isn't a big deal for most, but that is exactly why I spent the money to get this device.The other thing I was hoping for was the ability to use the upper page turn button to go forward and this device does that and even better because it is software configurable.The cover is very small and light and doesn't add much bulk like the Voyage Origami case does. The only downside is that it doesn't work as a hands free stand for reading.(I still wish it was waterproof)",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"Despite not being able to get one of these from Amazon until late June due to apparent strong demand, Best Buy was able to get one to me on the day of its release, April 27. Well done Best Buy! Having owned several previous Kindles, including the most recent Paperwhite model, I was unprepared for how small and light this new Oasis model is -- reading about it is one thing, but actually holding one in your hand is something else entirely. The Oasis and its battery-charging cover together weigh only one ounce more than the latest Paperwhite with no case. The Oasis _without_ its cover feels impossibly light at 4.6 ounces. Size-wise, the Oasis is nearly a square shape at about 5"" wide by 5.5"" tall. In fact, the shape is so different from traditional Kindle designs that I had to compare it next to my Paperwhite to verify that the screens are actually the same size (they are). It's the first Kindle I think I could easily fit into a jacket pocket without any effort, For frequent travelers like me, this is a key reason to buy one of these, as it's extremely compact and easy to pack in a briefcase or purse. The screen is the first front-lit Kindle I've ever seen where you simply cannot see any trace of the LEDs from any angle. No dark spots, no bright spots...just a completely uniform illumination from edge to edge in both directions. The ""page"" also appears to be nearly flush with the top glass surface, helping achieve the illusion of printed paper. It's sharp and clear, better than any Kindle I've used. The reader can be easily separated from the battery case by simply pulling them apart, since they are held together with magnets. After doing so, this is where the Amazon engineering team's achievements really become clear, as you just won't believe how lightweight this thing is. It's easy to imagine holding onto it for hours without any arm fatigue, and switching from hand to hand is a simple matter of rotating it 180 degrees when switching. The display instantly rotates, and the page turn buttons also ""follow"", with the top button always used to advance the page, and the bottom button always used to go backward. You can also use the screen to change pages as you always have with earlier touch screen models. The battery on the reader has a lower capacity than the cover's battery, so it runs down faster if you don't have it connected to the case. It's very easy to snap the reader back into its cover, which allows it to recharge while you continue to read. The power button and charge port are located in the upper top-right corner, more or less opposite from where they are on the Paperwhite. I find this location to be less awkward, as it's easier to reach on the top than it is on the bottom edge. The back surface of the reader (not the case) seems to easily attract fingerprints, and they are not so easy to clean off. You'd think that Amazon would have figured out a way to prevent this by now. It's a minor annoyance. Lots of reviewers in the tech press have complained loudly about this model's high price relative to other Kindle models (without ads, it's $310 vs. $139 for an ad-less Paperwhite). Is this a lot of money? Perhaps, but if you are a book addict and value an extremely lightweight reader that's easy on both your arms and your eyes, then I personally think it's worth it. A lot of thought and effort clearly went into designing and building this unit, and the price reflects that. Is it for everyone? Probably not, but there is obviously a market for it when you consider how many months you'll have to wait to get one on Amazon's website. If you are a serious reader, this device deserves a very close look -- I'm definitely keeping mine!",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I got oasis yesterday, very lighweight compared to voyager, screen size comparable, like having actual page turn button, touchscreen seems kinda slow, the on/off button on top is improvement from back of voyager. cover does seem kind of flimsy, but supposed to be leather so will see how it holds up. finding it easier to hold with cover on, then removed. cover doesn't have separate charge port, so all charging is done thru kindle.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"When they first announced the Kindle Oasis, I did not have much of a desire to upgrade from my 1st generation Kindle Paperwhite. Just as I felt when they announced the Voyage.I read a lot, so my Kindle travels with me throughout the day most of the time. I have never had an issue with battery life, I have only had it get really low a few times (typically when I was traveling). So again, I originally did not see a lot of the value to the Oasis.As the reviews for the Oasis came out, I started to realize what I did not like about my Paperwhite, and I began to have an interest in upgrading my Paperwhite to the either the Oasis or possibly the Voyage. The main thing I noticed is that I took my Paperwhite out of the Amazon case quite a lot, especially when I was in a seated position. This slight reduction in weight made it much more comfortable to hold for longer reading sessions. I had some other minor issues with my Paperwhite, like when reading in the dark, I couldn't find an adjustment for the light that I preferred (5 was a little too dim and 6 was a brighter than I needed). I decided to pass on the Voyage because I really did not like the case options and the pressure sensitive page turn option.Now that I have the Oasis, I definitely think it was worth it for me. I really appreciate the reduced weight when the cover is off (not to mention the ease of removing the cover compared to the Paperwhite). It provides the same reading experience, although I did get a resolution upgrade compared to my older Paperwhite, which is a plus.The Oasis is really comfortable in my hand, which helps me forget that it is there. When I was holding my Paperwhite with my left hand, at times I would accidentally go back a page, which drove me crazy even though its just a minor inconvenience.I have the black model because it was the only option available unless I was willing to wait a few more months. The build quality of the Oasis and its case is very nice, just like with the Paperwhite and the amazon leather case for it. The only concern I have is how well it will protect the Kindle. I will update the review if I find this to be a problem.I loved my Paperwhite, and I will recommend it to anyone looking to upgrade from an older Kindle or buying one for the first time. It definitely is great and the better buy, but I am glad I decided to order the Oasis. The reduced weight, ergonomic design, and page turn buttons make it worth the added cost.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I bought 2 and am returning them both. Both had lighting issues. On the first one, one half of the screen had a white/blue tint and the other half was more of a yellow tint. When i flipped the device upside down to rotate to use with my other hand, half of the screen went much darker than the other. I returned it because I had read there were some that had lighting issues and bought another one. My second one was worse. You could see little half moons going down one side. That one also had a much yellower tint overall than the first one.I found it not easy to hold unless it was in the charging case. It was too slippery and, weird to say, small for me. I'm a female with average sized hands.I think what I really did love was the charging case and the size for transport purposes. Maybe when they make a few tweaks and lower the price I might try again.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

"I debated buying the new Kindle Oasis, since I've owned every Kindle since the first release. It was worth the money, as the form factor is the best yet... it's comfortable to hold in one hand, and the text is crisp and easy to read.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"Even when I’m outside in bright sunlight, the words of the book I’m reading are still crystal clear. That alone makes the Kindle Oasis worth what it cost me.The Kindle Oasis wakes up in just seconds, and any book I choose instantly opens, ready to be read.It is the perfect size and isn’t heavy or bulky. I really do read for hours at a time. Sometimes I pace the floor while I read. Sometimes I’m on my elliptical machine when I read. And sometimes I’m sitting down. No matter what I’m doing, the Kindle Oasis remains comfortable to hold, and it is always easy on my eyes.When I receive a book that is in PDF, most of the time I can enlarge the words. If it won’t allow me to enlarge the words, I can change the orientation of the page and the words are automatically larger. I am able to make notes on the book if needed, and I can highlight words and/or passages.My merlot leather cover is attractive. When I flip it open, it is just like opening the cover of a book.How to Make the Battery LastOn the Kindle Oasis page, it says that its “dual-battery charging system delivers months of battery life.” This was a huge thing for me. Instead of having to charge my tablet almost every day, I would be able to read for months without charging the Kindle!Is this how my Oasis has performed? Well, not so much. There are conditions that have to be met for the charge on your Oasis to last for two months.First, you have to limit your reading to thirty minutes a day. That one is impossible for me. There are days that I am only able to read for thirty minutes, but they don’t occur very often. My Kindle goes everywhere with me, and I use just about every spare moment to read.Second, the wireless needs to be turned off. That one is easy to do but not always easy to remember. The only time the wireless needs to be on is to download one or more books.Third, this is based on your light setting at 10. That is way too low for me. I keep my light setting anywhere from 16 to 18.I don’t limit my reading to thirty minutes a day, and I try to remember to keep my wireless turned off. My light setting is kept anywhere from 16 to 18, and I put my Kindle to sleep the second I’m done reading. So how long does a single charge last me? Ten days is the longest a charge has lasted me so far, but it would have kept a charge for several more days if I had remembered to turn my wireless off. Once I succeed in keeping my wireless off, I will let you know how long the charge lasts.Now, I don’t plug it in to charge as soon as the charge on the cover gets low. I allow my cover charge to go as low as it will possibly go and then the Kindle battery will start to drain since it can no longer charge from the cover. I allow it to drain down to about 50% before I plug the cover and Kindle into my computer to charge.The one thing that surprised me was that everything on the Oasis is in black and white. For some reason, I thought that maybe the book covers would appear in color. But since I bought the Oasis to read books on, color isn’t needed.Special offers do appear on my screen but only when my Kindle is going to sleep or waking up. They aren’t a distraction, and to be honest, they are kind of fun to look at. You can pay a higher price so they won’t appear on your Kindle if you would rather not see them.I asked myself some questions once I had my Kindle and knew just how it worked. If I had known before I bought my Kindle Oasis that the charge wouldn’t last for months, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have. If I had known that everything would appear in black and white, would I still have bought it? Yes, I would have.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"This is my third Kindle. The best differentiator is the form factor. Definite improvement over the paperwhite. Also like having the page-turn buttons back. Case is very cool indeed.

"I was so looking forward to this that I bought it right when it popped up as available on Best Buy. This is obviously the most refined Kindle on the market as of now. The ergonomics are just perfect, as there is no other Kindle or any ebook reader for that matter that is as easy to use single handed as this one. Fits perfectly in the palm and the page turn buttons are a joy to use.The charging case can be removed while reading and it snaps back easily, you do not have to deliberately align it properly. Once the case is connected it starts charging the Kindle which prolongs its battery life.In short, if you are an avid reader and can spare $290, this is the Kindle to buy. For occasional readers it might not make sense to spend so much and the Kindle Paperwhite should do just fine.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I have used Kindle e-readers since Amazon introduced them years ago. All are good products and each new model has been a worthwhile upgrade.

"I've had lots of tablets in the past, mostly from the Samsung line, but this is my first Amazon Fire, so I want to write this review for others who have never tried one of these. At the time that this was written, Alexa had not been added to the tablet.First, while this device runs an Android type of operating system, Amazon puts its own spin on the operating system. I don't feel like I'm using Android. This feels different to me. It doesn't have the same level of customization that Android users have come to appreciate. That being said, if you are an Amazon Prime member, this device has been tailored to be your content entertainment machine. It's simply a fun way to consume your magazines, books, etc.There are 3 on-screen buttons on the bottom of the device. The middle button immediately takes you to your home screen. The button to the left acts as a sort of ""back"" button. It also lets me get rid of my keyboard when I don't need it on screen, but it's open. The button to the right is super important. It took me a couple of days to realize what it does. That square shaped button is what you press you see what apps you have open. It lets you switch between apps, but it also lets you see which apps you have open and close them out. You can close them by pressing the ""X"" button in the corner of the window that appears or by touching the app window and swiping to the right. If you leave all of those apps open and you never close them, you'll drain your battery. Make sure you use that little square button to clear your apps.The device has several menus that you swipe left to view. First, you start with your home screen. You literally can stay on this screen and do anything you need to do on the tablet. All of your apps are housed here. You swipe up to view all of them. The tablet comes with several apps pre-installed such as Slik, Amazon's own internet browser, Audible, Good Reads, the Amazon app store, a weather app, etc. You can go to the Amazon app store to download other apps such as Twitter, Facebook, etc. You can combine the apps on this page into folders. You just drag one app to another app and a folder appears. This made my home screen much more manageable. You can change the size of the font on the home screen from normal to large or small in the device settings. This feature doesn't necessarily increase the size of the font within your apps, however. I believe it only changes the font on your main screens.If you have a magazine or newspaper subscription that is connected to your device, when you have a new issues, it will show up at the top of your home page screen under the heading of ""new items."" The device comes with a free 6 month subscription to the Washington Post. You'll see that under ""new items"" when you initially activate your tablet.You can change the wallpaper on the screen to use one of your own photos. You can do this through the settings menu on the device. If you want to use one of your own photos, however, you need to either take it on the device or move it into Amazon's Photos app, which is a cloud-based app.So far, I haven't found a way to effectively use a different photo management app that will let me change my wallpaper. I'm not crazy about the Amazon Photo app. I found it annoying to move my photos from my phone into Amazon's cloud just so I could view them on my tablet. That being said, I'm not planning to take photos on this device. I just wanted a few pet photos on there and the ability to change my wallpaper.Beyond the home screen, you can swipe to the right to view your other screen. They are pre-arranged to be: books, videos, games, shop, apps, music, audiobooks, and newstand. All of those screens are connected to your Amazon account. For example, if you have Kindle books you've already purchased, they automatically will appear under the Books menu. Your magazines and newspaper subscriptions will appear under the newstand menu. There doesn't seem to be a way to change the order of the menu pages. That bugs me, but it's not the end of the world. There's also one menu to the left of the ""home"" menu. It's the ""recent"" page. It shows you what you've received looked at on the tablet. I never use it, but it might be handy for some people.One of my favorite features of this tablet is Amazon's ""On Deck"" capability. If you're an Amazon Prime member, Amazon will periodically download a video to your device that it thinks you might like. The items don't count against your pre-installed memory and they automatically deleted off if your memory starts getting full. You can turn off the ""on deck"" feature if you don't like it. I've been content with the video playback capability. This isn't my major use of the device, but the images look fine and the audio is OK. I'll talk more about the speakers later. My other favorite feature of this tablet is viewing magazine content through the Newstand. I've tried 3 magazines on here and they all look gorgeous. Now, I can always have my magazines with me so if I'm stuck at the airport or at the doctor's office, I always have them. One of my regular magazines includes a free digital version of the magazine for free. I just had to connect my account to the device. This allows me to download the back issues of the magazine for as long as I've had an account. My other magazine didn't include a digital edition so I canceled the print edition of it and switched to the digital version. (It was an inexpensive magazine, anyway.) There are several magazines that you can try free for 30 days on the device. I did this with a third magazine and decided to keep it for a year. Viewing magazines on this gadget is a pleasure.The Kindle Fire doesn't come with the Google Play store installed. You can side load it to the device without rooting it (and breaking your warranty.) You can Google to find the instructions to do this. It's not difficult to do if you're fairly comfortable with technology. It probably took me 10 minutes. Most of the apps I wanted were in the Amazon store, but there were a handful that I had paid for through Google Play. The only way I could have them was to go back to access that store. They have worked fine so far. I despise the keyboard that Amazon pre-installed on this device. There are no lines between the letters on the keyboard. I suppose it designed to be better for swyping through keys, but I hate it. I fixed that problem by going to Google Play and downloading a new keyboard. It was a pretty easy problem to solve so I can't complain.Apps that are connecting to the Internet can be a little slow to load on this device compared to my other gadgets, but that generally doesn't bother me. If you were using this tablet to replace your personal laptop, however, that might drive you crazy. The screen on this device isn't bad. If I compare it to my fancy phone, it's not as shape, but when you think about the price of this device compared to my smartphone, the screen is outstanding.The speakers are OK. There are two of them located on the bottom of the screen. I won't say that they are fantastic. They aren't. In my opinion, they are fine for watching YouTube or a television show. They are not OK for listening to music if you are an audiophile. You can make it a little better by downloading a different music app instead of relying on the pre-install app, but still your music will sound tinny. That being said, you can always connect your tablet to a bluetooth speaker, use a pair of headphones, etc.This device wasn't made for taking pictures. It has a front and back camera, but they aren't designed to be spectacular. I'm not using them.I find this device a little difficult to hold in my hands. I think that's partly because of the size and partly because it feels very slick. Also, I do have some hand problems (similar to someone who has Carpal Tunnel syndrome). I think it will be easier to handle once my case arrives. I'm still waiting for it. I'm greatly enjoying this device. It's simply fun to use the tablet. There are weaknesses that come with that lower price tag, but you legitimately get a lot of bang for your buck, particularly if you regularly use Amazon services. If you don't typically use Amazon and you are just looking for a tablet for viewing the Internet and you're looking for a low price tag, this device may be OK for you.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

This tablet was a gift for my nephews and nieces to share (ages 4-8). Their eyes lit up as soon as they tore off the paper and saw the bright orange package. It was easy to set up and they were quickly downloading and installing their favorite games from the Amazon App Store. Screen quality appears to be very good and processing speed is very quick!

"I bought this for myself on Black Friday and am very pleased. For a FIFTY DOLLAR tablet, it has a great display and battery life. It's capabilities are below many system requirements of applications and games meaning they may not run at all or if they do, poorly. That's fine for my needs as apps/games aren't my focus. If you're buying a tablet for games/apps I would recommend looking past the Amazon tablets and over to full android os tablets or ipads as the google play and apple app store have muchhh more options. In that case, it definitely is worth it to spend more for tablet capabilities.I use my amazon fire 7"" tablet for reading, searching the internet, shopping from amazon, and watching movies from my sd card. It works great for my needs. The volume is fine and it does have bluetooth so I have my bluetooth ear buds connected to them most of the time. It's the perfect size and weight and does not feel 'budget.' Note: the invisible screens for this tablet are SUCH A PAIN to install and in my opinion not even worth it. If you want to protect the screen, I would recommend going with amazon's fire case it's very nice quality and the cover flap flips over to protect the screen when you're not using it.My point, if you know what you're getting and are ok with that, you're going to really appreciate this tablet.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"Bought to replace a work issued IPad. Some differences I've noticed:+survives repeated drops off the loft to the floor, unlike ipad+small, lightweight, fits in my small purse or daybag+cheap price means I'm willing to travel with it, take it anywhere, leave it at work unlocked- I don;t worry about theft like with apple devices-more limited apps available than ipad, but most major apps are there (but not my favorite list making app)-silk browser forgets that tabs were closed and always reopens to whatever page you've been browsing lately (but might make for a good accidental parental watch/ control to see what the kids surfed last)-standby battery lasts several days, active use all day, but not like my ipad, where I could leave it on standby for weeks, shorter standby battery life for the FireI use mostly for web browsing, social media, and Kindle books. no other cons noted.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"I bought this tablet as a gift for my mother-in-law, who is not very tech-savvy. She already owns a laptop, but was interested in getting a tablet to use while watching TV, rather than a whole laptop. She also travels around quite a bit, so having something light she could take with her was a big plus. I've owned a couple Amazon tablets before, so I had an idea of how they worked, and I wanted something at a low price point, so I decided on this. So far, she loves it! A couple of important points:-The low price point comes at the cost of hardware. After using my Fire HDX, this tablet felt just a little slow, but not excessively so. It performed better in basic tasks (loading apps, web browsing, etc) than I expected based on my experiences with other tablets at similar price points.-As an Amazon tablet, this runs a modified version of Android, but does NOT have baked-in access to Google services (including the Google Play Store). You will be restricted to Amazon-approved apps, unless you sideload apps on your own, or are able to get access to Google services yourself. Popular apps like Netflix, Skype, and Facebook are all present, but the selection pales in comparison to native Android.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"So far the only complaint I have is not with the product but with the policy regarding the product. I had one for just about 2 weeks when I noticed a definite issue staying connected. My wife, who has had her Kindle Fire for months, said her started acting up if she had too many apps on it. I started removing them, even to the point of restoring to factory settings several times. After trying for about a week, it simply would not stay connected to the internet. It did stay connected to our wifi. I contacted Best Buy, but since it had been over 2 weeks, their policy is they can't help, unless you've purchased the extended warranty from them. They said that's Amazon's policy. I contacted Amazon, and after a fairly brief support chat, a new Kindle was on the way to its new home. I've been pleased with it since its arrival. It does most of what I need (email, facebook, minimal web use), saving ""wear & tear"" on my laptop.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

I purchased the kindle fire for a vacation we were going on and really only thought i would use it for books and maybe a few games but was surprised at how well i was able to access the internet with it. the only thing that i can say negative about it is the sun glare. in the sun it is next to impossible to see what is on the screen. indoors or shade and it is fine,0.0,1.0,2016.0

"My daughter had her 8"" Kindle Fire HD stolen earlier this year so when we saw this one on sell over the Thanksgiving holiday it was a no brainier to purchase it since it was $100 cheaper than the Fire we purchased a year ago, granted the Fire HD has a much crispier screen but for my 9 year old daughter, she is now happy just to have a tablet again.

"The main reason I purchased this was because I like to annotate scriptures and insert personal notes or related notes to passages especially meaningful to me. It's much easier to insert comments now with the keyboard display than it was to insert comments on the old Kindle I have, so that was a huge bonus. The one draw back/gripe I have is the ""back"" triangle button. The scriptures I read have hyperlinks that take me to other scriptures, and before on the old Kindle, I could hit the back button and it would take me back to the previous page I was on. E.g., if I was on page 10, and selected a link to page 14, the back button would take me back to page 10. With this kindle, the back button takes you back to the library, and the previous page tap/swipe takes you back to the previous page, e.g., if I'm on page 10, and I take a link to page 14, it'll take me to page 13. The work-around that I discovered is using the bookmark function which is only slightly more time-intensive than the old Kindle back button. The only other concern I have is the battery life. If I'm going to enjoy some long reading without heavy annotation (e.g., reading fantasy), I'll probably use my old Kindle. If I want to do some serious annotation and cross referencing on different commentaries (e.g., scripture study), the new Kindle is the better bet. The commentaries I reference are PDFs - I could create a Kindle book out of them, but it messes up the tables in the PDFs, and I don't care for the PDF viewer that came with the Kindle because you cannot bookmark the PDF or annotate it. I purchased a very inexpensive PDF app called ""exPDF Reader"" which does everything I want with PDFs. All-in-all, the Kindle - Fire is a great tool and fits into my lunch box, so I take it everywhere. I read that others were concerned about it's weight, but I find it to be light. I'm used to reading door stopper books, and it is definitely more manageable than one of those. A pleasant surprise I had was the ""blue shade"" feature which enables me to read at night without worry of negatively impacting my sleep cycle/quality of sleep. You don't need a separate booklight for this like you do for the old Kindle, so that's a nice perk too.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.",0.0,0.0,2016.0

"When I first heard that Amazon had released a budget tablet, I was skeptical on the price that quality would be sacraficed. Boy did I have the wrong assumption, this product has exceeded my expectations and then some. The screen is responsive, the animation on screen is silky smooth when you zoom in on a picture or scroll up and down, it's just all out impressive. Front facing camera too is kind of cool although the quality is not as good as the camera that is in the back. Games play fine on this but you'll be wanting a memory card to store games on it. Games play fine depending on what you install on it but some games suffer minor framerate issues if too much is happening on the screen.

"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports.

But if you want to hold a good quality piece of hardware in your hands for not a lot of money, this is a great choice. Amazon has a philosophy. They want to make money AFTER the sale. So that's why they get you in at a low price. Also, they have created a revenue stream by selling ads. When your screen times out, it will post a ""screen saver/wallpaper"" that is an advertisement.

I purchased the fire 7 almost one year ago. It is a very good tablet for the money. Screen resolution isn't the best but is adequate. But at this price point I am not complaining.

Cameras are so so but I don't use them often if at all. Having the micro SD slot is great. Amazon does a great job of automatically up dating the OS. I just received the Alexa update yesterday.

"For what the Kindle Fire does, at $50, it's practically a steal. The reason why I bought the Fire was because it's excellent 'Read Aloud' function. There are many books that do not come in Audiobook format, which I need- I don't have as much time as I would like to sit down and read these days. The Kindle Fire has allowed me to finally get to these books, while I'm working out, or driving.Good points:It reads aloud very well, with several fairly natural sounding voices.Amazon can convert most PDFs into a readable format, and you can change the speed. Battery lasts pretty wellBad Points:The Fire's OS could use some reworking- switching bluetooth on and off isn't exactly convenient, being buried under a few menus, which don't seem to be customizable.All in all, it's a great buy at $50!",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"I have two Kindle Fire tablets, both the 2012 and 2014 versions so I'm rather familiar with them and how they work. For my son's 7th birthday, he asked for a new tablet. He'd been using Leap Pads for the past few years, but was also used to using one of mine when needed. I debated back and forth between this version and the Kids Edition. In the end, I chose this one. In having a kids profile set up on the Kindle, all auto-pay turned off, and being able to decide which apps I put onto his profile, I felt this was a better option. The tablet is quick, good size for his hands, and has enough memory for any of the apps and books I want to put on it for him. We found an awesome case to protect it. For the price, I don't think you could get any other tablet. I am very happy with my choice and will likely continue to choose Kindle products.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"This is not as cheap feeling as I thought it was going to be. It's definitely not in the iPad class but it's not bad for what it is. I ordered online and did not have one in my hands until mine arrived. Pros: The screen is decent, sound is loud enough for me, no lag scrolling and Real Racing 3 plays smoothly. Cons: The major down side is battery charging time, battery life and built in storage space. When it arrived, it was showing 76% remaining. After less than 2.5 hours use, it had to be charged. I just read where it can take 6 hours or longer to charge. My iPad Air 2 can fully charge in a few hours from 0%. Built in storage is not enough. Yes you can get micro SD cards however some apps will only install on the built in storage. Also, you can not delete Amazon apps without voiding the warranty. And unless I'm missing something, you can't move them either.So if you are looking for something to use casually for web surfing, email, watching movies, reading books and the occasional game, this should be just fine...keeping in mind the battery life and lack of built in storage. But you won't be doing any serious work on this like you can on the iPad's. But to be fair, this is 1/10 the price of my iPad Air 2 and 1/8 the cost of an iPad Mini 4. But I don't believe it's meant to be a direct iPad competitor. Because if it were, it would fail miserably.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

While the Silk browser is not the fastest browser in the world it works just fine for my needs. I also added two security apps via the Amazon app store to keep me protected. They seem to work well so far. The screen resolution is acceptable for my needs and while I haven't downloaded any movies yet, I'm confident they will play well. I should also add that I had to separately download an update from Amazon to install Alexa. While doing I needed to call Amazon tech support and they were excellent and very customer centric, responsive, and helpful.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

It's great that as the parent, I can buy a book or game, and all devices can use it, even with each other if it's a multiplayer game. I bought a cheap case elsewhere that also props it up for hands-free video watching.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"We purchased this tablet for my daughter for Christmas. She is in kindergarten, and her school allows them to take a device in to use in class. For $39 I couldn't beat that. Especially since i'm not going to send a 5 year old to school with an iPad!This tablet uses FireOS, which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically when I look at an android tablet, major deviations from vanilla Android will make me deduct ratings. The parental controls override any rating deduction in my mind. This tablet has the best parental controls I have ever seen! In addition, the alterations to the home screen make navigation pretty easy for my daughter. All in all this is a win win!The thing that has really impressed me has been the speed and responsiveness. Don't get me wrong, this is not a premium or flagship tablet by any means. With that being said, I have used Android tablets in this price range, and they are garbage! My wife has an insignia tablet that cost $70. It has a higher res screen and a few more features, but it nowhere near as responsive. When it dies it will probably be replaced by an Amazon Fire tablet!Keep in mind, Amazon is trying to hook you into their ecosystem. There are separate home screens for various types of content that Amazon delivers. Your books on one screen, or you can swipe to music on another, etc. From what I see there is no way to have more than one screen of apps. The nice thing about the Amazon ecosystem is that it is cross platform. They maintain apps for Android, iOS, Roku, Windows, MacOS, and so on. Also, their app store is not as extensive as the Google Play Store, so I may end up doing some side loading. That isn't hard, and instructional guides are available online for you.So in conclusion, this is a nice entry level tablet. I would bump up to the Fire HD8 for the extra features if buying for myself. However if buying for younger children or if you're really tight on cash you can't beat it! My twin boys are about to turn 3, and these might be on their list for birthday time!",0.0,1.0,2016.0

It's a decent quality tablet for the money. One complaint is the speakers are weak. Have to cup my hand around the speaker side to get some good feedback.

With a bluetooth keyboard it seems adequate for messaging and writing out notes.Video quality is good enough. Though that has more to do with not being super picky about it. I'm considering gifting my dad one of these this year. He commented that the quality looked good. Another complaint would be the amazon app store is limited. No Clash Royale. Which is the only mobile game I actually enjoy. I'm sure there's a way around this. But I'm really not interested in digging around for it.

This is a handy feature for me since I travel for work, and spend a good deal of time on planes. Cons: The only drawback I've found is the Web browser. It's not supported on in flight WiFi, but the ability to download from Prime for later viewing balances that out. I will experiment with side-loading Chrome and see if it works.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"I was pleasantly surprised that I have enjoyed the Kindle Fire. This was my first ever use of buying books on Kindle due to summer courses I was taking at the time in May/June 2016. WHAT I LIKED- Kindle Books Synched on MacBook and Fire tablet: very helpful when it came time to write my papers. The highlights I made while I read the book on the tablet synched to the version I read on the MacBook desktop. This helped a ton, especially with things like formatting the footnotes.- Watching Videos: cool little feature while you watch a video you can tap the screen and it will list the actors who are currently one the screen. - Amazon Shopping: I can now understand people's Amazon shopping addictions.l I will give it to Amazon, this tablet became my gateway to using Prime and countless hours of online browsing. Prior to this I rarely purchase items online, I can see how they have made it so easy across platforms. - Portability: I like that I will bring this with me for my general online browsing and reading needs rather than having to use my laptop or my phone. WHAT I DID NOT LIKE- Sign-on Screen Ads:There is no way to turn them off. I suppose for $39/49 depending if you purchased on a sale, the advertisers are subsidizing the cost of the tablet. However, I wished this was stated as a ""feature"" before purchasing it, I may have paid the money and upgraded to the next Kindle if I had known it could not be turned off. - Turning Off/Standby Mode: This took some time to get used to rather than an issue. When you turn the tablet off, it is really on a standby mode so the batteries will drain. You have to hold the button a little longer and make sure it is turned OFF. - Weather App: I don't know if this is just my tablet, the weather app does not update as soon as you open it. It takes minutes if at all to update with the current weather. I have not been able to find in any forums if other people are experiencing the same issue. I have instead downloaded and used other weather apps. But at this point the app is worthless. - Screen Resolution: It's not the best, but I got used to it. For reading and occasional video viewing purposes it is sufficient. - Screen Dimmer/Blue Light Mode: I read and use the tablet at night, and have gotten sensitive to the brightness of the tablet screen. And the system's default dimmer and Blue Light feature is awful. The Blue light app allows you to set the color tone however, it is so orange it makes it unreadable. The app I use instead is called Bluelight Blocking. And even dimming the brightness with the slider was still too bright for me. So I have had to download the app Dimly so be able to set the brightness.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"Originally purchased to practice rooting Android devices. Started using it and determined that I liked it so much I did not root it.It is by design and understandable and expected that it is tied to Amazon everything. Books, music, mp3 all are available through Amazon Underground. Not as many and maybe not your favorite apps are available but it is loaded with many offerings. NOTICE: by design, the tablet downloads and stores all files to an SD Card, if one is inserted. Solidly built, it will withstand child's play. The resolution is not super high but is very good for its size. I read using this tablet and the text is very clear. In fact, I use text readability as the test for evaluating a tablets resolution. After start up, you can go through simple process to connect this device with your Amazon account. This to allow purchases on the tablet. The parental controls are top notch. You can limit or allow as little or as much websites connections, limit purchases also. You can also load Google play on this tablet. With a little searching and downloading of files, you can download and play all Google Play Store Apps.-battery life is good.-speaker is good, single speaker only.-Blue Tooth connection easy. NOTE: if you have Sync (Microsoft) installed in your vehicle, the tablet will connect but has trouble reconnecting! It is Microsoft, what can you expect.

It's fantastic, customizable, safe and easy to stay hands-off. I use it with both tablets with both kids. Time limits, no questionable content (depending on what you call questionable; i hate KidzBop) and excellent apps, etc included.Tablet is more than powerful enough for adulting, too, so if you despise kids, you can still enjoy your lonely, hollow, selfish existence with this outstanding tablet.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

It's great for beginners and anyone who wants a light, compact tablet to carry around. I also have a 10"" Samsung, but this was difficult and heavy to hold while reading.

"I have been wanting to give these little tablets a try for some time now. I went ahead and made the purchase yesterday while they were on sale. I'm originally an Apple guy, but my iPad has seen better days.The tablet is nestled in compact packaging. Inside you will find the sync cable/charger, and the tablet itself. It comes wrapped in a protective plastic bag. It looks pretty good quality, and feels great in my hands. It is very easy to grasp with one hand, leaving the other free for whatever else you may want to do.The setup is really straight forward with a few simple questions. If you are already an Amazon customer, you will be asked to input your information during setup...making it even easier to get started. The picture quality is really good for the price of the tablet. It's not HD, but the quality is still pretty good for everyday tasks. Amazon's app store is packed with tons of apps, movies, books, etc... There is definitely plenty to choose. I have access to Amazon videos, store, and everything Amazon at the palm of my hands. The only downside to the tablet is that Amazon uses its own ""Silk Browser,"" which I am not a very big fan of. I tried to see if I could download Chrome, but that is still not an option. Hopefully it will be some time in the future. The browser is a bit slow in certain web pages, but functional. Another thing that I found very useful is the simplicity of setting up my e-mail account to the tablet. The only thing that I notices was that it took a while to load my account, but the setup is very easy. You have access to pretty much everything in the palm of your hands. Overall, this tablet is a great value for anyone that is in the market for a low cost tablet. It may take some folks a some time to get use to Amazon's OS, but it should not take very long to do so.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

Even though, there are a lot of options and most big apps (Netflix, hulu, etc.) are all supported.There is also removable storage. It is very nice to be able to add a memory card to expand your memory.

"Picked this up for my wife, Wanted a spare tablet for watching some random shows and do some book rentals/reading from Amazon. $49.99 is a price that can't be beat, wish i would of picked it up on Black Friday as it was only $34.99.The Tablet has a single speaker, its loud enough for sitting in bed or in a room, also has a 3.5mm standard headphone jack to plug in headphones, or use Bluetooth.Screen resolution is very good for a budget 7"" screen. Nothing high def (HD) but for the screen size it is very good. If you come from a higher end Android or iPad, you may be disappointed at first with the screen, however you need to realize where this tablet sits on the Tablet Echelon, its entry level for both Amazon and the entire tablet line for all tablets....its a $50 tablet that runs almost everything.Fire OS is very similar to Android OS, extremely simple and easy to use. You CAN make multiple logins on this device so kids have their own screen and apps, or make a guest account to be able to pass the Fire Tab to another person without having access to your information. Perfect for sharing.Battery life is great, lasts about 3 days with moderate use (email and web surfing with brightness on 100%)8GB internal memory isn't enough for more than 1 or 2 books and a few apps, highly recommend getting a 32GB micro SD card to expand the storage.It does come with unlimited Amazon Cloud storage for photos and music. Camera on the Fire Tab is good for well lit areas, no flash on the camera, but you can snap away photos and auto upload/backup to your amazon cloud drive. Also comes with a trial of Amazon PRIME.Would definitely buy again.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

I have also listened to music, read a couple of books and watched videos. I will say that you do need to remember that it is a $50 tablet, so don't expect to get $200 worth of tablet!

"I got this tablet with high expectations given it's from Amazon. However it was disappointing in many ways and it will be returned.First off, despite of the small screen size, it's heavy. Too heavy to be used as a book reader in bed.The deal breaker for me was that there's no way to connect a VPN using the regular Android settings. The option has been deactivated and accordingly to the tech support, ""it's not available yet, but it will come"". Surprisingly, still according to them, none of the new Amazon tables on sale have such support! Apparently Amazon doesn't believe that open WIFI at coffee shops, supermarkets, airports offer data security risks for the tablet users.On top of that, the Amazon version of ""Google Play Store"" has a reduced number of Apps and the ones I was interested in are not available.And the cherry on the top, was that only after 15 min of small usage (I was still trying to find a way to connect to my VPN), the screen frozen and the tablet became unresponsive.Too bad!

"The tablet was bought for a few family members, two of which have bought several Kindle books. But only the price is the only note worthy thing about it.

"It's a $50 tablet, you're not going to get all the bells and whistles. We got it for my toddler daughter to load apps, games and movies to take with her in the car/out to eat. You may already know that it does not come with standard Google apps so you cannot use your gmail to use apps from the Play store. There are workarounds found on YouTube that you can load Google apps through a 3rd party, and I easily did that but found that even those workarounds do not work for the Movies/TV app, so we can't watch any of her purchased movies on this which was the main objective. Apps and games load from your gmail fine so that is what she is now using it for. For $35 on Black Friday I guess it is still worth it. Just really wanted her movies on it.The UI is very basic and promotes purchases everywhere. The lock screen advertisement is obnoxious but I guess they have to make their money somewhere. I took all the bloatware Amazon apps that you can't delete and put them into a single folder to make it less cluttered with junk that my daughter wouldn't need. Also helping to avoid involuntary purchases. The camera is miserable on it, not that I ever use the camera even on my $500 Samsung, but just an FYI.

"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device.

Obviously it's a budget tablet so you are not getting a full HD screen or iPad like performance but it's also a 5th of the price. It definitely powerful and responsive enough for web surfing, Facebook, casual games and media consumption. If your a Prime member it's a great way to stream all of your Amazon Video shows & movies.

"The Amazon Fire tablet is a pretty solid tablet reader for a very low price. Reading Ebooks is very comfortable and there are some really great apps available through Amazon's App Store. The one drawback is the web browser; it's a bit sluggish. This tablet is great if you are looking for an e-reader, and the price is outstanding, but if you are looking for an actual tablet computer you should look elsewhere. Don't buy this expecting it to perform as well as an iPad; it just isn't that kind of device. Overall, though, I really like this.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

Apps were all useless, and the only thing you could do is listen to preloaded music( not streaming music) and read ebooks. Anyway, I changed my mind in the last minute and decided to root it. Installed slimLp and got rid of Amazon's junk, and it made a huge difference. The performance is way better and it actually works like a decent tablet now.

"I got this for $35 during Black Friday. Since I've had it, I noticed that the battery life does not last very long. I have to charge it at least once a day. At first, I thought that I may have a faulty tablet, but I looked on Amazon's website and the Fire has a battery life of 7 hours...no wonder.The size of the Fire, though is small enough that I can take it with me when I go out and am waiting to pass the time. I also bring this with me to the gym and watch movies or read on it while I'm on the treadmill or stationary bike.I use the Fire for different things. Mainly, to play apps and stream videos on Amazon prime. For these functions, there's a little in the animation, when I play games, but it isn't frequent.I have read several books on the Fire and I must say, that I prefer to read off of the Nook HD. The print on the Fire is a little bit fuzzy and is not as crisp as the Nook.Since the Fire is from Amazon, it is locked down to only work with ""Amazon approved"" apps. As I mentioned earlier, I have a Nook as well. On that, I am able to download the Kindle app and read books that I have purchased through Amazon on the Nook. On the Fire, however, I am not able to download the Nook app so that I can read books that I have purchased through for the Nook.Overall, for the price that I paid, this is not bad.

Turning the pads completely off does not always help and sometimes, we cannot even get them to turn off. When they do work properly though, the kids love them.

ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM is that almost all apps that you would get on iphone and android are not availabe on the amazon fire appstore and there is no way to download them, for example clash of clans, racing rivals( which have decided to withdraw from the amazon contract and delte there game off amazons app stores).

"Don't let the 8GB prevent you from buying this Amazon tablet! Once you insert a Micro SD card, the tablet literally saves everything to the Micro SD. Be sure to get a screen protector if you plan on letting little kids play with it because the screen isn't as scratch resistant as an iPad or a Samsung Galaxy Tab. For Forty bucks, you just can't find a better value and with Amazon Underground, you can get a bunch of free apps which also include free in-app purchases... yup all the coins and tokens and gems and whatever else you want for free! Note that this thing comes with ads... but they only appear on the lock-screen and actually aren't that bad. They are nicely designed and don't make your lock screen look janky. Other than that, you'll want to have a PRIME membership so you can take advantage of the PRIME videos and what not. I recommend getting at least 32GB Micro SD (I believe it supports up to 128GB) to store pictures, videos, music etc... obviously get a larger capacity card if you're a download junkie.The pictures it takes are OK... good enough for viewing on a screen, but don't expect to be printing high quality pics with them.Screen quality is pretty good... not sharp and crisp like a Retina screen, but I was able to read my Kindle books just fine. The viewing angle is also decent and won't make you feel cross-eyed like some cheaper tablets out there.Battery Life is very good on this tiny tablet... something like 4-5 hours with normal use. Videos and Games will probably drain the battery faster than anything else, but it runs every game I've thrown at it so far.If you have kids, the Free-Time app is very cool... you have to pay a small subscription (like 2 bucks a month or something with PRIME) but it gives the kids access to a whole bunch of curated content, games, movies etc. just for the little ones so they don't mess with other apps or get into things your stuff.Well, that's all I can think of... this is a great little tablet of pretty good build and quality... if you're paranoid about scratches and dents get a case and screen protector and you're golden.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"Pros: - A beefy machine for the price;- Great battery management in standby.- a solidly built android tab at a rock bottom price.

"I haven't paid much attention to the Fire since the very first one out years back. But recently I purchased an Amazon Echo which I am thoroughly enjoying. And I discovered that my Echo was capable of 'voice casting.' This basically means that whatever Alexa is saying can show up as text or pictures on a screen (recipe or weather map, for example) and you can then print it out! So I wanted to explore voice casting and the easiest way to do that is with an Amazon Fire. What a deal! $50 for the most recent version that boasts all manner of things. I even get free movies! So I purchased a case for the Fire that would work as an easel stand, set it up as a photo frame displaying a rotating series of my digital photos, and whenever I want to I can voice cast from my Amazon Echo! Playing a music album? I can see the album cover and list of songs on my Fire. Checking what's playing at which movie theater when? I can voice cast that info so everyone can see it and vote. And we haven't even talked about using the Fire as an easy go-to for email or games!",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"The number one aspect of this tablet is the fact that Amazon will stand behind it - for a short while. I am on my 3rd, all of which have been plagued with screen issues. Dead pixels. Everywhere. If you don't have them straight out of the box, great..but, they can develop - and in the great majority of these, they will develop. It is a known issue, and Amazon will (at least for now) replace the tablet at no charge to you. As of now, they have a 'zero dead pixel tolerance policy.' That will likely change (if it hasn't already). As far as operational ability of the tablet, it runs smoothly, and allows for up to a 32gb micro sd card - which I highly recommend, as they are absolutely boiling over with bloatware (if you buy an 8 gig, you'll have about 3.5 available to you). It is a decent tablet for browsing the internet, using as an e-reader (however, the screen isn't as bright as other e-readers), or mp3 player. As they say, you get what you pay for. This is a decent basic option.",0.0,0.0,2016.0
"I had a first-generation one and still in good shape. I purchased this new one mainly because of its updated OS 5. It seems also lighter. The performance is quite satisfactory.

"I am amazed at this little tablet! I had, and still have, a Kindle Paper White for 3 years before I dared to try to use it, and after using it I was intrigued by the possibilities.... I joined a public library and began reading books for free. When I had trouble downloading some books because they were EPUB instead of KINDLE, I decided to look into the FIRE. This FIRE cost me $39! Amazing. I don't use a SMART PHONE and normally only find myself online at home or someplace where I drag my laptop like a hotel or at Starbucks. This little number allows me a lot of flexibility. Besides downloading books, I can go online, I can download music from my AMAZON PRIME account for free (music that I don't want to pay for to get onto my IPOD CLASSIC). I can hook up the FIRE to my BOSE speakers and the sound is great! I already watched a PBS TV show on the FIRE while waiting to get an oil-change done on my car at the dealership. I added 64 gigs of memory for about $20, thinking that I might build quite a music library on this little machine. Since the memory is removable, if the tablet gets deep-sixed, no problem transferring the music elsewhere, I think! I have almost figured out how to get the music from the FIRE onto my MAC...but maybe it can't be done ... I don't know. AMAZON doesn't let you download from the PRIME music library to a computer...they only allow the download to tablets and phones. But there must be a way around this...I think it's been fun trying to figure it all out. On the downside, I hate the fact that the screen is not an anti-glare screen to begin with, but I bought something which I think will solve that problem. Don't like the fingerprints ... I'm trying to get used to the notion of a touch-screen. I'm OLD...I don't like change...so adapting is not that easy. But I'm working on it and I would say for the money, even adding the cost of the accessories I purchased, that this was a worthwhile meander into the realm of mobile connectivity. I'm having a lot of fun with it! The tablet DOES subject one to advertising when you open it...but I ignore it. I ignore all advertising everywhere so it's not hard for me to do...it's a well-ingrained habit. If I were forced to look at and read the advertising however, then I would consider a more expensive tablet that is free of advertising. But for the money you have to make allowances for commerce, I guess. I'm an APPLE person so I felt this would be very hard to figure out, but it's pretty intuitive after about 4 hours of making endless mistakes! LOL. I SAID I was old...don't expect to know what you are doing right away if you are essentially a technological idiot. Thing is you CAN figure it out. I don't read instructions so maybe if someone were more willing to have things explained to them it would be a shorter learning curve. But I only learn by trial and error. Have fun! Buy the thing...it's so cheap that if you hate it it's no big loss! The screen adjustments for reading are good...font size, background color, etc. I needed to have something that was easy on the eyes...this works for me!",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader.

Overall, this tablet is a good value, but you have to be careful about certain aspects.The tablet is really fast for something in this price range. The screen has pretty good resolution as well. There is no Bluetooth connectivity so keyboards and wireless headphones won't work with it.The app store is the Amazon app store. I side loaded Google Play and am getting my apps from there (YouTube helpful for instructions). The lock screen is an Amazon billboard. The default search is Bing instead of Google. I haven't figured out how to fix that yet. I just use the Google app to search Google. You can load the Chromecast app from Play, but it is hit or miss as to whether it works. It works for YouTube and Flixter, but it doesn't work for any Disney Apps (Watch ESPN, Watch ABC, etc.). You can cast the screen and view things that way, but the resolution is limited to the resolution of the tablet's screen.I think it was a good deal since it was cheap, and I can now watch my Prime Movies on it.

"I think this tablet is better for simple usage. Not so much for a whole lot of apps and games, as the memory is used up SUPER FAST for only being 8GB (when in reality you don't get the full 8GB to begin with). I got this for my 7yr old daughter and the apps eat up the memory which eventually slow down the tablet and make it kick off the wifi because there isn't enough memory for it to fully function. You pretty much HAVE to get a memory card for it with atleast 16GB or more. But for a starter and for basic stuff...checking social media etc it's fine. And for a starter tablet for kids.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

"There is a good amount of value in this device, particularly if you consume content from Amazon. I bought this tablet for my daughter but her primary source of content is YouTube and there is a dearth of quality YouTube apps on the Amazon app store.

It is a solid device - I have not encountered any glitches, freezes, or app crashes but it is not used as much as our other devices. I would recommend it if you consume Prime content or you are clumsy with electronics.Pros* Good value (almost disposable)* microSD slot* Underground* Multi-user support* Easy access to Prime contentCons* Amazon's Fire UI* Amazon's App Store* No support for Google apps such as YouTube, Gmail, etc.* Battery life could be better* No stock content producing apps like iMovie, GarageBand, etc/",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"I bought the 16 gig Fire 7 tablet and added the 64 gig sim card before I went on a trip to Iceland. My plan was to use it to read kindle books I had in my library, but also to use it to read email on the 7 day trip. Since it was a wifi only device, I was dependent on the hotels I stayed in to have wifi. No problem there, they all had free wifi. (This was great since I had tried to use my old kindle to access the internet and it never really worked, and no email was happening.)There were three bonuses: Internet access, games (solitare, sodoko, etc.) and movies on the plane, and when it was too rainy to get out my SLR to take pictures, I could use my camera on the Fire 7 and easily wipe the rain off of the screen. The fire was small enough that it was easy to put in my carry on and I didn't have to take it out for TSA screening. All in all, it was perfect for the trip, oh yes, I had subscribed to the Washington Post before I left and that meant I could keep up with the political news and hurricane Matthew circling back across the atlantic to hit Iceland and bite us. Only bad thing, not fire7's fault, was that because of matthew's rain, we didn't see any northern lights. Good thing I had my own personal entertainment system--Fire 7 tablet.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"I ordered this online on black Friday, I live about 30 miles from nearest store and I saw the special on their website, so why not I thought. Came in yesterday. Maybe it's just because I'm not familiar with this product; I'm used to Android tablets that have you set up with your Google account. This one you set up with your Amazon account. OK, no big deal I thought, at first. Then I found it very difficult to install the free 6 month Webroot it came with. I went to Google Play as instructed, it says installed, but there is no Open button to click to continue the process, as instructed. When I contacted Amazon customer support, I was told I can't use Google Play on it and to use the app store instead. I was given a link for Webroot installation but it didn't help. I downloaded Google Chrome but can't find it on the device. No youtube, facebook, gmail apps; won't install. Again, maybe I'm just not used to the product but if I can't use Google apps on it, I won't like this. It's actually for my son and even though teens are often smarter than we adults when it comes to gadgets, LOL, I don't think he will like this either.

I had originally bought my son the Kindle Fire HDX. And it worked great for him. The only downfall to it was he wanted both the rear and front facing cameras. But it only came with the front facing camera. As children do they break things. And he broke the screen on this one after having it for a year. I did not want to spend that much money on the second kindle so that's why I chose this Amazon Fire 7-inch tablet. And it has the front and rear facing cameras and that my son wanted.

"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning.

The price isn't bad compared to the price of adult tabletsCons:Kind of bummed I can't link my Google Play apps I purchased but I guess it makes sense this is not a Google/Android product.

The paperwhite Kindle provides a very eye-friendly experience, with sharp text even at a small size. And there's no struggle with holding open pages of a book. Unlike the Kindle Fire, obviously, it is not a good choice for browsing the web or reading e-mail. Navigation between books is not as easy as I would like; a half screen of 6 recent books, with the other half taken up by ""recommended"" books is not as handy as a full-screen text list of my books would be.

It allows me to read anywhere even in the dark without worry about fumbling with a reading light. Although I love the feel of a real book and watching the bookmark go further through the pages I am starting to get over that. The connivence of holding this instead of a book and also being able to have multiple books going at once without carrying a bunch of books with you is great. I can fit this in my coat pocket on the train while I commute. It is pretty small and now that I figured out how to borrow kindle books from my library via overdrive I save a ton of money by borrowing instead of paying for all my kindle books.

"I own tablets, have a surface pro 4, and have a smart phone. I have the kindle app on all these devices and it works great.

It's very light and feels great in your hands. The screen is amazing and I never have any kind of issues with being unable to see it due to sunlight, a dark room, etc. But probably most amazing of all is the battery life. It's been 2.5 weeks since I bought my kindle and fully charged it... I just now finally went a little below half battery life. I use mine to read books and graphic novels.

"I was a previous Voyage owner for a year but then left it on a plane (don't forget to check the seat-back pocket before you leave!). I was debating whether to buy it again but all the reviews I saw online said it wasn't worth the $80 premium - they're right.First off, the resolution is the exact same 300 ppi on both models. The Voyage does have better contrast but it's something I stopped noticing after 24 hours. The backlighting on the Paperwhite also isn't as even, as I notice it's darker on the bottom but again, I stopped caring after a few uses. The weight difference is negligible and they both have incredibly long battery lives.About the only time I miss the Voyage is when it comes to the page turn buttons. On the Paperwhite, I have to touch the screen, so when I'm lying in bed, I'm forced to use two hands to avoid it from falling on my face. With the Voyage, I could just press the page ""button"" and keep my hands on the border. Again, far from a deal breaker and something I adjusted to quickly.Overall, the Voyage is the better Kindle but not worth the premium cost.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

The last reason is the best. Recently Amazon added the Open Dyslexic font to the font options and it's fabulous! The next best option I found is Helvetica.

"My previous generation Kindle Paperwhite got scratched a little on the screen, so I debated about picking up a new Kindle, but it was worth the $120. The 7th generation Paperwhite has twice the memory, runs a bit faster so it's noticeably quicker in response--making highlighting and annotating easier, and the uneven screen lighting problem (the older Kindle had ""shadow"" spots on the bottom edge of the screen) has been solved.My only complaint is that Amazon continues to put ads on the Kindle, which you have to pay $20 to get rid of. It's almost necessary because I use the Kindle to view books in church. Very inappropriate when the ad for a murder, crime, or romance novel pops up as a screensaver.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"This product has been so thoroughly reviewed that I won't repeat the obvious in any detail. It's great for reading under all conditions -- sharp typefaces and, of course, illuminated. Two small issues: 1. in dim light conditions the light at the bottom of the screen is a bit uneven. There are slightly darker areas just above each of the four lights that illuminate the screen. This does not bother me and it isn't noticeable in a brightly lit environment. More annoying is the fact that the Search function doesn't work with some books: for those, searching brings up no results, no matter what I enter. I have the same books on my Kindle Keyboard and have to use that to find what I'm looking for. I haven't contacted Amazon about this, but it seems odd. On other books, it works as expected. One other thing to keep in mind if you have an older Kindle is that it will need to be recharged more frequently, given that it's illuminated. Overall, I like this reader as the display is excellent, it's easy to hold, and page-turn and other navigation features all work well.

"Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place. It was easy to accidentally press a footnote when doing normal forward or back. Pressing the top right “x” sometimes returned to text, but often was dead - requiring selecting “Go To Footnotes”. Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble. Enabling the “x” at all times would be safer.3) Occasionally a small print message such as “91 highlighters” would appear between the lines.

I upgraded to the paperwhite after my very old Kindle died. I like the paperwhite screen. I hate that the pop up adds and recommendations have absolutely no connection to my reading history.

"After struggling to read books for the last several years, my husband suggested getting an e-reader. I never wanted one, because I previously enjoyed the feel of a real book in my hands. He was pretty convincing, so I went online and researched a few different ones. I settled on this one, after reading so many great reviews. I wanted the Voyage initially, just because it had page turn buttons, but I opted to save some money, and the page turning with the touch screen is incredible, I don't think I'd use the buttons, even if I had them. I am already halfway through my first book, and I've had this less than 24 hours. I'm a very slow reader, so this is impressive! I tried it in the sun, and it was extremely easy to read- no glare. I also used it while working out today- it's very easy to adjust the font to make it easier to read. I am so in love with this, and am so happy we bought it! I am excited to get back into reading, and to have thousands of books at my fingertips!",1.0,1.0,2016.0

I thought she was spending too much time engaging in mindless activities on her phone and computer and thought this might be a good alternative. She has responded surprisingly well. One feature that I really like is the dictionary. If she comes across a word she doesn't know or can't read, she can tap on it, and the dictionary will pop up defining the word. This enables her to use her inference skills to decode the word or understand the meaning better. This has been a nice addition to her bedtime routine.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"I love my new kindle. I bought one earlier this summer for myself and just recently for my ten year old. One function that is awesome is its ability to work with the audible application. I can read on my kindle then audible will pick up where I left off, so I can continue with the read during my commute. My kindle will then propose to move my place to where I left off in audible. It has made my commute very purposeful because I am able to read literature for work a lot more efficiently.

"Well, it happened. I became a huge fan of e-books, preferring them over an actual, physical book! This old fashioned woman with a preference for all that is vintage NEVER EVER thought that would happen; then came the Kindle Paperwhite. I think I have read close to 10 books this past month because of the Paperwhite! I can make the font larger (which is great for my old eyes), and it is lit from the side, so it does not make my eyes tired like typical LCD screens, where the light shoots up at your eyes. Because of this, you can read easily in bright sun or in total darkness. Also, the battery lasts a very long time; I usually have to charge it only after reading a full book. And an added bonus is that you can't get any apps on the Paperwhite, which sounds like a negative, but that means there is no distraction/temptation to surf the web instead of read. When you open it up, you are committed to reading. It is sooooo much better than my Nook, which makes my eyes tired and is a distraction.It is among the best purchases I have ever made!",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"The Paperwhite is an excellent product. It is very lightweight, easy to hold for long periods of time, and user-friendly (software wise). Be prepared to have a slower reaction time than a typical tablet (or Amazon Fire); this is because of the e-ink. However, I will take the trade off, as you are able to read e-ink in every environment (sunlight, dark rooms) without any eyestrain -- something that is not possible with a regular tablet. Screen response time is only slightly delayed because of this.If you have a Prime membership, you have access to all of Amazon's library, which has a large selection; however, most disappointingly, you can only rent one book per month unless you upgrade to Amazon's Kindle App, which is an additional $10/month. I find this to be mildly frustrating. However, you are able to rent books from your local library whenever you would like.Overall, I think the Paperwhite is a fabulous product for reading, with only a few drawbacks. I enjoy reading on it very much.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

I spent quite a bit of time reading reviews and talking to others before making my decision, and I am so glad I did my research. What I like most about the Kindle Paperwhite: the adjustable screen lighting is spot on and easy on my eyes, whether I am reading in dim room light or bright sunshine outside; the ease of syncing it with my computer and wifi; the speed of downloading a book; the ability to adjust the font size; the ability to bookmark and pick up from where I stopped reading; and the size and weight which makes it very portable. I opted for an envelop-style sleeve for storage rather than a cover you might use for an iPad or similar tablet. It's easy to slip the reader out of the sleeve and begin reading.

"I am looking at the oasis and voyage but thinking they will be expensive paper weight in 3-4 years because that is the average life of kindle, this is my #4; they get slow, froze and die after 3-4 years.

I do average 12-20 books a year, with the kindle of course, no worries on where to store them.

I will be creating my own reading lists and want zero input from Amazon. The battery life seams to be awesome. Of course when you shut it off ads pop up. The kindle claims that it doesn't take up battery to display these ads. But they seem to mysteriously change on their own (even when it is turned off) Strange.

This one with 300 dpi is just OK. Scrolling is fast enough, it has integrated vocabulary. No home menu or other physical buttons though, besides the home Kindle one - the UI is not completely responsive when you try to go to your Library, instead home brings you to Amazon Kindle page, where you are overwhelmed with advertisement.My biggest dislike is the volume of advertisement and thus the convoluted interface.

"I broke my Kindle Voyage after almost two years. My heart was as broken as the glass cover!After looking at the latest line of Kindles I decided to try the latest Paperwhite as it had the same screen resolution and was a lot cheaper. Plus, a white model to match my other white/silver gadgets! It does have a few less LEDs for backlighting, no flush glass cover (but that is what broke), no auto-adjusting light (that never quite worked anyway), squeezy sides, and a tiny bit heavier/bigger than the Voyage. The Voyage also has had no hardware updates since it was released and the new crazy-expensive Kindle uses leather and has no not-leather option for people who don't like their high tech wrapped in animal skins. So instead of saving up for a while and reading on my phone, I sprung for the Paperwhite.I've been using this for about a month and the quality has impressed me. I don't miss the glass cover as much as I thought I would, although sometimes pet hair will get caught between the bezel and the screen and need to be pulled out. The screen is great, doesn't clash with the white casing, and although not quite as even a backlight as the Voyage, still much better value for what you get. The software is essentially the same, and Amazon has been slowly improving Kindle software for all the recent models.If you like Amazon for books, I highly recommend this Kindle. You can't beat it for price/value and it really doesn't feel any heavier even after an hour or two curled up with your books.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
My husband prefers the Paperwhite model over the Voyager because it is easier for him to hold in his big fat fingers since it has a larger frame so more room for the fingers.

It took me but a few minutes to setup and learn how to use the device.If you have prime you should see all your books right away but If you don't have prime but have someone in your house that does you have to setup a household and share everything to my wife so she was able to see all the books that i had purchased (i can be selective after they are shared). One thing i noticed was there is the kindle lending library, it only allows 1 book to be borrowed per month.

"Purchased to replace an older model that died during a software update (lost wifi connection during the download, bricking the kindle). This model has 300dpi, up from 220 on the previous model. With text it is barely, if at all, noticeable. With any kind of graphics or cover images, the increase in resolution is nicer. Unfortunately the lighting remains uneven at the bottom of the screen as it was in the previous generation. The voyager model supposedly has better lighting but at twice the price it wasn't worth it to me. And the uneven bottom lighting isn't bad, but it is there and I would have thought Amazon would have fixed that by now. Maybe it is a limitation of having 4 light sources vs the 6 on the voyager. Still, the lighting is not bad and this is a very nice eReader. Noticed the background is a touch more beige than the grey on the previous model which is a welcome subtle change, easier on the eyes. Like too that the font is a dark grey versus pitch black which also reduces eye strain especially for those with dyslexia who can be sensitive to harsh contrasts. Overall, highly recommended.

"I had this device for few weeks before returning it and getting the Kindle Voyage. But the only difference between the two is the design, page press buttons and the auto dimming light as they both have the same screen. After purchasing this device, I immediately devoured three books in the course of a weekend. Which, sadly, is more than I've read in about two years. This device has reinvigorated my live for reading since it is so portable and the battery lasts for quite a while. I would suggest that you get the genuine leather cover for this device when you buy it as it just adds that little extra to the purchase. Overall, I would recommend anyone that wants to read more, reads often, or reads many books at once to take the plunge and buy this device. Plus, new books can be upwards of $20-$30 sometimes. This little device will carry all of your books and only costs the price of a few hard copy books. Plus if you need a physical copy, you can always borrow from the library.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"First, the good news. The screen is a nice brightness and the words are crisp and clear. Best of all, it is so light and tiny (esp. in the Origami case) that it is super-easy to carry around in a purse. Love that. Also it has an amazing battery life; I have never had it run out on me and I don't even have to recharge it all the time. I thought this would be perfect but I am having two problems: (1) turning pages is not as easy or pleasant as my much-older, now-defunct Kindle. If I don't touch the screen in the right place, the page won't turn, and it usually has an annoying split-second black flash on the screen. The ancient Kindle was easier. (2) About half the time, when I return to reading, the screen is ""frozen"" on the ad. It says ""swipe to open"" but no amount of swiping gets it going. I have to reach to the rear of the kindle (which means disassembling the crimp in the Origami) to press the button on the back to get it to function again. There is no rhyme nor reason to when this happens but it's about half the time. Perhaps I am doing something wrong regarding both flaws but there is no one to ask about it, Best Buy staff doesn't know.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"The text is sharp and paper like in well lit conditions. When using the backlight in dark conditions it becomes less paper like but is quiet useful if you wanna ditch clip on lights.

Practically any book at the palm of my hand on this one device. I also like that it has page press which is outer press buttons for page turning. One con is its not all that speedy and responsive when going though the store, though it is the fastest kindle yet. I would NOT say it is 80 to 100 dollars well spent over the paperweight. In fact i would recommend the paper weight when its come down to price. Im just someone who wants the best of the best so I bought 2 of these. One for my love as a gift, then I went and bought myself one. It was a well recieved gift and I aquired major browny points. We give them 4 thumbs up.

When you turn off the kindle there is a screen saver that is typically some kind of ad, which is kind of annoying, but it's not really worth it to pay to have the ads taken off.

"The Amazon voyage really is a fantastic ereader. Prior to owning this tablet, I had a couple of PW2's which are great tablets in their own right. My wife knew that I had my eye on the Kindle Voyage but I was waiting to catch it during one of Amazon's rare sales events. Unfortunately my wife ended up buying it for me for Father's Day and I planned to take it back and wait for a sale but after comparing it to my PW2 side by side, I decided I couldn't wait for it to get cheaper and so I kept it. The PW2 is a great ereader (ended up giving it to my oldest son) but the Voyage is more crisp and the backlighting is quite a bit whiter. It's also a couple of ounces lighter and slimmer. Is it worth the upgrade? Definitely, if you can get it on sale (usually $150). At $199? Well, that's up to you. Obviously I paid full freight and I don't regret it.....much. :) With that being said, the PW3 is worth a look too. Same 300 ppi clarity but usually $80 to $100 cheaper.

"This is my third Kindle and by far the best. I know use this for 100% of all reading - including - and the reason I bought it, for reading in the pool. I still own 2 good tablets and a laptop.

I have about 300 books on this and don't charge it but once every other week. I use it 1-3 hours a day without fail.

"I purchased my Voyage yesterday. It looked like I scratched the screen today and I contacted Amazon directly and they replaced my Voyage under the warentee I did not need to go thru bestbuy. Turns out it was food and not a scratch and canceled the replacement but point is Amazon backs up their products! I do not think its worth 199$ for there is a weird screen discoloration where the top appears orangeish and the bottom blueish but only under certain lighting conditions BUT its barely noticeable. In normal light it looks quite normal. Due to cost it will be a great first purchase but no real need to upgrade from paperwhite BUT in its defense the Voyage is much much lighter, thinner and more responsive and the page turn buttons are seamless. Over all this is a mighty nice product. Side note: I own a Nook glow-light plus which is cheaper and looks nicer and has a great feel to it as well. Nook glowlight plus is more stylish with the copperish color back and white textured front. The Voyage is attractive too BUT I think it will sell better if it had a "" two toned"" color Like maybe a white front and a colored back side. Voyage is much faster than the nook but prettymuch same features. I just feel Amazon can afford to make their product more stylish. Also best buy does not seem to offer and real choices for cases on their kindles and tablets. I had to order a cover at ebay.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"I have to say upfront - I don't like coroporate, hermetically closed stuff like anything by Apple or in this case, Amazon. I like having devices on which I can put anything I want and use it. But...I was a fairly happy user of a Nook Touch for several years, but couldn't use all its functionalities since I live in Serbia. Then I lost the Nook and since no other devices can actually be fully used in Serbia (buying books with them, using their online capabilities) except the Kindle, and since no one except Amazon ships to Serbia, and since I've actually been a happy Amazon customer since 2005 over friends' accounts and since 2007 through my own, and since the Kindle definitely has the best technology - why not buy itSo I did. What I read in many reviews about the screen/light of the Paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine. The light disperses just fine, except a few black blotches (maybe you can see it in the picture) at the bottom of the screen, which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can't really be avoided. As you can see in the picture without the light - there are no blotches with light out.The Paperwhite's screen is just marvelous at 300 ppi, the touchscreen works just fine, the store works here in Serbia, and in these two days I've been using it, I'm a happy guy.I had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like Amazon books, but that's fine. That's the one thing I'd like to see Amazon do in some future upgrades: make the Kindle treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly, with sharing funcion (quotes and Goodreads) enabled and so on.The size is perfect, it sits very well in the hand, the light doesn't hurt the eyes in the dark (like the light on a tab does)... the packaging was fine, no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life.So far, I can only recommend it.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"Comments on Kindle Paperwhite1) Basic functioning of page forward & back - excellent2) Footnote action often led to loosing place.

Picking the correct < footnote returned to correct position - but too easy to accidentally press a different footnote - send me off to wrong text position. While doing things right raises no problems - it is to easy to get in trouble.

It's also great for traveling. I have all my books on hand no matter where I go.  There are only two cons to the paperwhite. One is that the touch screen is not that receptive as compared to an iPad.

"Before the Echo we played music often for our toddler via Pandora on the Amazon Firestick. I am generally not an early adopter for the newest technology, but with a 95% music use case in mind and to experiment I pulled the trigger and bought one. Within a week I subscribed to the single-device option for Amazon Music Unlimited at a cost of 3.99/month after a free 30-day trial. Now we rarely use Pandora due to the expansive Amazon selection. I also upgraded to a smart thermostat and am looking into Philips Hue Color lighting. My experience has been positive enough to also buy an Echo Dot with Harman-Kardon Onyx Mini speaker for my parents. While great, however, there are opportunities for improvement:1. Sometimes Alexa fails to find a selection which it succeeded at before. I made sure my command was identical and clear.2. The suite of skills is weak and mostly pointless. I only use the news flash, weather, and traffic.3. Search functionality for facts/answers is limited and based on reviews is likely worse than Google Home.4. There is no integration with the Firestick/ Fire TV which is surprising. Currently one must buy a Logitech Harmony hub to do so.5. Alexa struggles to find certain classical pieces even though I have confirmed them to be available on Amazon Music. Part of the problem might be the many versions which exist for a given piece as well as the distinction between composer and performing artist.Overall, I would recommend this product especially for those who listen to a lot of music, but don't expect perfection quite yet!",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"Echo is a great device to have if you need an answer to a question or need the weather report, etc. One of the best uses I have found so far is the creation of a shopping list. As you think of items for a shopping list, just tell Alexa and she will add it to your list which you can recall later just before going to store. It is fun to ask Alexa trivia questions or use her for other fun tidbits of information.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"Having all that information at my fingertips is so handy. We were always looking up info on our phones, now we just ask Alexa. Tying it into the home makes life so much easier.

The echo is absolutely amazing. You can ask Alexa almost anything and she'll respond with an answer.

"Echo is an excellent gizmo for people on the Amazon eco system. It does/has many things - music, weather, news, jokes, trivia, Bluetooth, speaker, good mics, home automation integration, calendar etc. It lacks an advanced capacity for web search which I suspect it's competition from Google may have. It also lacks in smart TV integration. Some other nice to have would have been a battery in it making it a little bit mobile and integration with other intranet speakers.

"I'm deepy invested in the Apple ecosystem so I approached using the Echo as a just something to experiment with. Now I understand Barry Diller's statement that eventually Jeff Bezos will be the richest man in the world. And for me it starts with the Echo.

I've ordered several Dots and am looking forward to being able to use a more serious speaker for music. Now that I've been sucked into the Amazon universe I've abandoned my Apple TV and replaced it with the Fire TV becuase of the Alexa voice control. The kids use Alexa for homework and even my ""beyond cool"" teenage son admits it's a worthwhile technology. I have a lot of fun with the IFTTT recipes; its become a bit of a hobby. And rather than having a technology where you blink your eyes and it's out of date, the best thing so far about the Echo is it just keeps getting better with more product integrations, ""skills"", and ever expanding content.

"I bought this for a family member who has very limited use of her hands due to a spinal cord injury. She lives in a nursing facility. My hope was that she could enjoy her favorite music and listen to broadcasts of her favorite sports team simply by speaking to the Echo/Alexa device. My big concern was that she would not be able to use the voice commands due to her weak voice.Happily, I can report that she loves it and is able to successfully use the voice commands. We have it sitting on her night stand about two feet next to her. And I know that she loves it not only because she tells me but because I can see, using the Alexa app on my smartphone, each and every time she interacts with the device throughout the day. I can even listen to the audio of each of her interactions with the device. And I am not exaggerating when I say that she often interacts with Alexa/Echo over 100 times throughout the day!So far, she uses Alexa/Echo to listen to her favorite music through my Prime Music subscription. We recently purchased a few songs that she couldn't find in Prime Music. She also often asks it to tell her a joke and check the weather outside. She says the staff at the nursing facility where she lives seem to be amazed by the device as well and she often demonstrates its capabilities asking it to tell her who the current president is. Currently, I am helping her become familiar with its ability to play local radios stations, especially the ones that broadcast Kentucky Wildcat sports games. When I reminded her that it could read books aloud, she requested a chapter of the Bible; I found a beautiful professionally produced audio version with professional voice actors on Audible.This product has been a real revolution in my aunt's day-to-day life and the Prime Music connectivity is bringing her great pleasure and stimulation. I am giving it five stars because she is able to use it unassisted simply with her voice and because the Alexa app gives me a new fascinating way to keep track of one aspect of her day.

Love the Echo ! Awesome tone to the sound ! Very easy to use I can use this paired thru Bluetooth with my iPhone or I can simply ask Alexa questions.

However I had the smaller version first and the tone quality and volume were not that great plus i had to get up go across the room to tap it to change anything or ask it anything. the echo you can just talk to it across the room which makes it really easy for you to be lazy ha ha:) I received this as a birthday gift and I really am enjoying it ...highly recommend it!,1.0,1.0,2016.0

Raise, lower thermostat. It all works very well. If you don't need audio quality, use DOTs. Echo is overkill for my use when DOTs are just as capable. With 6 DOT, 1 Echo and smart 42 devices connected, the home is very smart. Echo and DOTs make it happen. I still use Echo in one location since it was the first part of the system I bought. But now realize DOT would have been fine in that location as well.

It can control a thermostat, turn on a coffee pot. The possibilities seem endless. When I purchased this Echo I had no idea it did so much. You know what else it can do? It can order items through Amazon by voice, add reminders to my calendar, make a shopping list for later use and even help me tune my guitar! If you have a large home, you can pick up an Amazon Dot, which allows you to access your smart home devices when the Amazon Echo is at the other end of the house. Forget to turn off the living room TV and you're already snug in your bed? Amazon Echo can remedy that with a single command if you use the Harmony hub. Want to set an early morning alarm? Just ask the Amazon Echo to do so and let it wake you to the sound of your choice. Having trouble falling asleep? Ask Amazon Echo or Dot to read one of your Kindle E-books or play some relaxing music. All in all an EXCELLENT product that not only makes life easier, but fun!",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"This is fantastic! We're finally tapping into the world of ""Smart homes"". However, with all the different devices, brands and apps it makes controlling all the devices a little bit cumbersome. So you can either get one brand and stick to it... OR... you could get this! The Amazon Echo consolidates and integrates ALL your devices. So now you can control all your devices, regardless of the brand, through the Echo. Also, the voice recognition is top notch.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

Then what are you waiting for ? If you don't have the money or really not into technology then this product is not for you. I have a iPhone 6s and use Siri not as much as I would like too cuz she doesn't understand me all that great but Alexa? Man she understands every word I say like flawlessly. The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the Skills now even tho it's over 3000 skills a lot of them are junk people made I wish more big developers would make some. Should be well known Trivia games in here even if you had to buy them unless I'm not looking in the right place. The main thing I'll prolly use the Echo for is to listen to music it's real easy to Alexa to play a song and it sounds great,0.0,1.0,2016.0

"Great little device. Very handy to have around the house. Microphone works surprisingly well. Must have Amazon Prime and obviously internet to take full advantage of product. Speaker sounds great in a small room. Louder than I thought.Only 2 cons that are annoying: 1. It should have separate volume levels for the 'Alexa' assistant and for music. When you play music at a lower volume then you can't even understand Alexa until you turn up the volume. 2. It is terrible at Google search. For some answers like ""what day is President's day?"" it works. For others, you don't get any answer.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

Other than being an excellent Bluetooth speaker (which it is), Alexa sets timers, alarms, streams music through many different apps, tells you the status of your orders on Amazon, etc. We love it so much that we find ourselves searching for other products that pair with Alexa to enable it to do even more for us.

"I got the Amazon Echo and the Dot to supplement it. Although they say that the Echo can hear from all over, it really can't.

So, I got the Dot for my bedroom and it works just fine.It's a little complicated to setup to the wifi but once I figured it out (I needed to turn off the automated wifi connection on my smartphone), it worked like a charm. After the Echo is connected to the wifi, you can turn the automatic wifi back onto your phone. I'm just getting started to using it with my Smart Home automation. So far, I can turn on/off & dim my lights in my living room with just my voice. Love it...!!! Once I get more bulbs for my bedroom and hallway, I'll add those too. It just gets expensive at $29.99 - $49.99 per bulb!!!Also, I wish you could re-name/call it something other than Alexa, Amazon or Echo.

"After all the great reviews I thought it would be wonderful to use as a helping hand running a business solo. However, for this case it isn't very helpful. Unlike Cortana or Siri, Alexa only works with commands based on the petty apps that can generate the commands. It can't use your whole phone or computer to pull up apps or anything special. Even the simple stuff like weather was a hassle to try to change location and simple data like calendar, and anything you want to learn just refers back to the Alexa app which by the way is absolutely awful. You can't use your own calendar alone, everything has to be linked to one of the several lackluster apps that have been created.

After dinner we played jeopardy on it after the show aired, and used it to dim the lights inside, and turn on the porch lights outside when it got dark and i couldnt get up without disturbing my sleeping baby on my chest, who incidentaly fell asleep to the echo playing soothing music....she can also tell you facts about EVERYTHING you probably dont know, including starwars which pleases the kids, tells jokes, plays rock-paper-scissors, AND can call you an Uber.

"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

I have a lot of Wemo switches and Lifx bulbs, and it's fun to group them together and tell Echo to turn on everything and watch it all turn on at once. It's also fun to ask her about actors and actresses on tv while watching, like how old is so and so person. Alexa is not perfect, but she is pretty good at getting things right most times. The bad thing is you'll find yourself wanting to buy more Wemo switches and stuff just to have fun with Echo. Note, Alexa can only control Wemo bulbs by using IFTT, but the switches it has direct integration with.

There are times when you have to word a sentence specifically but that is just a minor annoyance. Amazon has done a great job updating the Echo weekly and adding relevant skills such as package tracking and even flight status. I use it mostly for news, weather, shopping lists, reminders, movie times, timers, and occasionally some music. If you have any smart appliances then controlling them with Alexa is really cool. I only have a smart plug right now but it is great to walk in to a dark room and just ask Alexa to turn the light on or when you are about to go to bed and do not want to walk in the dark, just ask Alexa to turn the light off once u are there. As long as it is a reasonable distance of course.

The best part of the Echo is its ability to recognize multiple voices at different volumes. My parents also use it and have been considering getting one for their home!The best app to use with Alexa is IFTTT. You can have IFTTT add things to Google lists and calendars, trigger find your phone, create custom light settings for smart bulbs, and even set up an emergency trigger to text a loved one in an emergency. These features are all great for me since I live by myself. I definitely feel more secure being able to contact help if something should ever happen. Echo skills also expand the use of Alexa by adding trivia games, recipe apps, and searching for hotels, flights, and movies. One of my favorites is Milo, which allows you to search for movies or tv and find where it is offered on multiple services like Netflix, Hulu, etc.The only downside I have found is you have to be very specific with some commands, such as which music service you want to access or triggering IFTTT. But Amazon has recently updated the Alexa settings with the ability to change Spotify to your default music player, so a lot of the specificity is no longer needed!If you have connected home devices or live by yourself I would definitely recommend the Echo!

"First and foremost the Echo is a good Bluetooth/connected speaker. It's no Sonos but I wasn't expecting it to be. It's really cool to ask her questions like you would a real person and get some good results. ""When is the cubs game/how are they doing"" and ""What are show times for Star Trek: Beyond"" yielded great results. To be honest though that novelty while very good and consistent wears off a little. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who hasn't invested in smart home tech because that is where the Echo shines. I currently have an Ecobee3, Phillips Hue, Sonos, August lock, and Harmony Hub. Right now the Echo works with Hue, Sonos, and Ecobee3 with the Harmony Hub being tested currently. There is no way to make the August work but there are ways to make other things work using apps like IFTT and Yonomi. I suggest anyone who wants one of these google those two apps to see some of the amazing things you can do with this awesome little device. I can turn on and off my lights, turn on and off my different activities with Harmony, play music, lower or raise the temperature and get basic info off the web. It's really cool and we are closer to Star Trek than ever. It is worth the money if you want to talk to your house. I love it. There are some failings. It doesn't understand some complex wordy questions while others it has no problem with. The list of compatible devices are limited but with those two apps I spoke of, IFTT and Yonomi that list is greatly increased, and the ""skills' you can get aren't good at all. Limited and poor.

"I'm in love with my new echo. I own a multitude of wireless Bluetooth speakers that I have used in my garage while working for years. Simply comparing audio quality, I prefer the echo over my UE boom, which was my absolute favorite until this point. It doesn't have quite the bass the boom does, but it makes up for it in clarity, volume and bass responsiveness. Other than being a great speaker on its own, it's a fantastic task companion.

"I bought a new mobile phone at BBY, and got a $150 gift card as part of the purchase, so bought the ECHO kind of on a whim. I am not a huge technophile, so I wasn't expecting to really love it.Setup was ridiculously easy. Connected to wifi, then connected to Amazon, Spotify, and Google Calendars accounts. Now its all voice commands for questions, music, and my girls love asking Alexa for a joke. I also connected it to my WEMO switches and it works well. I am still learning the different things I can ask her.I almost gave it four stars, because it takes a little getting used to with regards to which questions you can ask, or how to phrase a command for the best result.

Yes it has its moments when it can't understand something but I do tend to mumble at times. Don't expect it to be a search engine giving multile results to an inquiry but it's a great speaker, home assistant, kitchen helper with measurements, and it even controls my home temperature on my Honeywell thermostat.

"This is my new favorite device. While not perfect, it's a lot of un to use.One of the features I like the best is the timer functions. I can start a timer for various items, while cooking, and Alexa will remind me when the timer hits zero. The best part is that, through IFTT, I can trigger Alexa to call my phone, or send a notification, if I'm not in the same room as she is. I do the same for when I'm doing laundry. I no longer have to go back and check how much time is left on the washer and dryer. I can even have my Hue lights to blink when the timer has expired.Right now, I have Lutron, iDevices, and Hue Homekit devices in my house.

If there was one thing though that I would have Amazon improve upon if they ever release a version 2 is to have the microphone distance be further than whatever it is at now, which seems to be about 10 feet or so.

"Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) ""What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?"". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) ""Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?"". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) ""Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?"". You'll hear ""Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with ""Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?"" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight.

I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do.

"I love my Echo. My son had one since it first came out and frankly I was not that impressed and didn't think I would use it. I love technical stuff and when they had a good sale on them, I decided to try it and thought if I didn't like it, I could take it back. Well, was I surprised!!! Ahead of buying it, I had already set up more of my Amazon Prime music playlist, and the library too. Then I also went to Pandora and created more playlists and stations there. That saved a lot of time. Set up was so simple, no problems at all. I find I use the News Briefing every morning, what's on my calendar for the day or a specific day, and playing the music a lot whereas with my ipod, I usually don't unless we have company. Also, adding to shopping list and to my google calendar I use all the time. I would say the negatives are - if you have the volume up higher, she doesn't always hear you for the command. Another learning curve is the commands themselves. It is hard to remember exactly how she wants you to say the task. Right now I am writing down on index card the skills I can't seem to remember, such as Mindfullness from Prime which plays quiet meditation music or you have to tell her playlist from what location and between Amazon Prime and Pandora, if you don't say the exact playlist name that you made, she can't find it easily. Overall, just love it - I looked into buying the Echo Dot to place that in my bedroom, but was so disappointed that they have sold out and discontinued it. There is some hint that they are bringing something else out similar, but I liked the fact that it WAS a plug in, not internal battery that only lasts a few years. I wanted to be able to take it on vacation and pack in suitcase but the Tap has a charger unit with it, more bulky, & not excellent reviews, but the Dot had great reviews.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime.

You may be wondering how the Echo fits into this review...well before Alexa came into our lives we had to have a phone or tablet on us, unlock it, find the relevant app, open it and select the action to turn off a light or whatever we wanted to do.

"The echo is a nice speaker that has the added bonus of being able to respond to questions and give sometimes useful information. However in regards to it being capable of serving as the brain of an integrated, automated home, it lacks much. I purchased it to use with Philips hue bulbs and I was hoping my fire tv. Although it shares the same software with the fire, and logically should be able to work together, it does not. Echo will not connect to or control the tv. As far as the Philips hue bulbs, it can turn on individual bulbs, or even a group of bulbs IF, and only if, you remember the exact phrase or name you gave it. It cannot dim the lights, set light scenes or any of the cooler options the Philips hue bulbs are capable of. I wound up going back to using my iPhone which respond to voice command of 'hey Siri' better than the echo anyway. If I had to do it over again, I would have saved the money and gone with a simple Bluetooth speaker for my phone as it can already do many of the things the echo does. Only difference is that the phone doesn't have as big of a range for voice pickup.I did give the echo three stars, because the one thing it does well is respond to questions, like what's the weather like.

With a quick command I can turn on or off any of my connected lights one by one or use an IFTTT command to turn everything on or off. Yes, it works with IFTTT!!! You can get pretty creative with it. Having a multi-level home, I can command Echo/Alexa to unlock my front door after seeing who it is via my Ring doorbell :). This is one cool device for lazy people like me LOL. I use it to get the weather, traffic, sports scores (Go Warriors!), and create/add items to my shopping list. It plays music from numerous streaming music services but being a Prime Member and having used everything from Pandora to Spotify I find Prime Music the best for my taste in music. It's also free with my Prime Membership so I don't have to listen to ads or get stuck not being able to skip a song I don't particularly like. I've also just recently purchased the remote which is a great accessory. I leave the Echo in my dining room/kitchen area and I can send commands to Echo from my bedroom without a glitch.

Alexa makes this worth it. AI is intelligent and does get smarter as you talk to it. She has some jokes too. This works even better with a Prime membership.

Nice to have if you have extra cash sitting around and you don't mind waiting so see if useful functions will be added, but without Android syncing and functions,or the ability to control for example,TV channels, it's far from Amazon's usual ""gotta have it right now!"" category.",1.0,0.0,2016.0

"I purchased the Amazon Echo to augment my other smart devices. Boy, has it made me lazy. Gone are the days when I'd have to stretch my arm out ALLLLLL the way to the lamp on my nightstand to turn it off. The days of pulling out my smart phone and setting my alarm for the next morning are also gone. Now, a simple ""Alexa, turn off my nightstand"" and ""Alexa, set my alarm for 8:30am"" is all I need. Even walking through my living room, I find myself saying ""Alexa, turn on the kitchen lights"" and ""Alexa, play my favorites playlist."" You see, it's addicting, and having a wireless speaker that plays music AND controls your life with simple voice commands means you end up buying two. I started with one in my living room but found that I had to yell to turn off said nightstand lamp or turn the thermostat down.... so I bought another. I have now repositioned the one in my living room so that it can hear me when I walk in from the garage, and added the one in my bedroom, which can hear me from the entry or my bathroom.Now, if only she could automate the rest of my life.

"Amazon EchoPros:1.Amazing speakers and voice recognition. I can be 30 plus feet away and communicate with the Echo.2. Speaker system in the unit is much nicer then anticipated. I compare it with the UEBoom device.3. The Amazon Echo App is very easy to manage and add in different functions to access. So many different programed commands with the unit that you will not even know where to begin.4. The design of the unit is very nice. Solid from top to bottom. Quick summary of pros:If you are looking for a unit to respond quickly to the weather, playlists, talk radio, and reading of non-audio books back to you. You will love this unit. I was not a believer prior to purchasing the device. Alexa is much more then just a novelty. Cons:1. The amazon Echo is stationary. If you unplug the unit you have to take the cable with you to plug the unit in the new place. So if you want the unit on a deck or a back yard table make sure you have an extension cord or an outdoor plug.2. If you don't subscribe to Amazon Prime then half of the units greatest options are nonexistent. With Amazon prime you can establish or use preexisting playlist from the Amazon music store. Also, if you have books you have purchased through amazon kindle app you can pull up those books on the Echo and have them played back to you. You can use Spotify as a secondary option but it require addition work on your part to set up playlists.3. The voice commands are clumsy. What I mean by this is; you have to ask the question exactly like it says in the echo app. Some examples are, ""Alexa, What is the weather like in Manchester England?"", ""Alexa, ask PGA tour for the round leader."", or ""Alexa play the best of the 90's play list from Amazon Music?"". If you miss the ask blank. She will come back with I don't understand the question. Cons summary:These may not seem to be a big deal but not having prime or not remembering the commands exactly will limit the Echo's capacity. The unit is meant to simply your life not make if more difficult for you to remember robotic questions. Overall;If you have or plan to subscribe to Amazon Prime, then this unit will provide you with some very nice simple moments. My family does and the Echo is used everyday from playing music from amazon prime, to finding out the weather, to seeing if our commute to work has any traffic to worry about. If 179.99 is not a lot of money to you for a more hands free toy. Then this is the unit for you.I hope this helps.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"Easy to setup, easy to use. I've had another tablet, but it wasn't as easy and comfortable to use. For what I bought it for, it's perfect for me. It weighs less than a pound (compared to my other tablet), and I can read what's on the screen easier. Without a manual, the best thing you can do is play with it.

"The Amazon Echo Tap is a nice & interesting device...but it did not fit my needs. I also have the Amazon Echo and absolutely love it. So what's the difference? A. You have to walk up the the Tap to touch it - this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the Echo from across the room. B. The audio quality not very good - more like a small bluetooth speaker. C. The Tap is fine around the house when it's connected to the home wi-fi, but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi-fi?? That is not going to work very well.",1.0,0.0,2016.0
"As a bluetooth speaker, the Tap rocks! The sound quality is excellent, plenty loud when needed, and excellent quality with no stutters in streaming. I bought this one instead of the Echo because it is portable, and I can lug it from room to room. The charging stand is very convenient, and the Tap stays there most of the time. Having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me, but is something to consider. (If you want hands free use, you may want the big brother Echo device, which is hands free, but tethered in place by a power cord, so not portable). The feel of the Tap with the black fabric cover is nice, and will not slip out of your hand. The fabric is like tough upholstery cover, so it won't stain or be easy to damage, but is quite attractive. I am glad they did that, as bare plastic would be easy to drop. I found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless, and it works as advertised! I mostly just use it for playing music and asking Alexa silly questions for fun! I occasionally use it for shopping lists, which shows up on my phone, and checking the weather. Who knows what the future holds,when I have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do? I understand that Amazon plans to add more Alexa skills all the time, and if one got into smart house control with compatible products, the Tap would eliminate all remotes, which I already have too many of. I think it is a really fun, cool item, and I am glad I got it! It is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing, especially the tiny smart phone typing ! I could get used to this! I have the Alexa app on my phone, which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone, like shopping lists, to do lists, calendar. The Tap can also check traffic, weather, movies, etc directly through Wi Fi, no phone needed. However, the Alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the Tap. The Tap can read Audible and some kindle ebooks to you as well! BTW, I haven't had any problems having it understand me, which is amazing, since I grew up in Texas and expected a problem with my accent. Obviously, this item is ideal for people who are Amazon Prime members, so you can stream Prime Music, although it also streams Pandora and other music services, and does many things without any connection to Amazon. I guess the most unique thing about the Tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly, without a computer or phone driving it - that and the voice control. I have paid more for smaller ""just"" bluetooth speakers, so to me, this was a super deal, and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment!",1.0,1.0,2016.0

It's great than I can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs, playlists, volume, etc. The Alexa voice recognition works very well--it seems to be more accurate than Siri. I frequently ask Alexa what song is playing. I also ask Alexa to search for certain songs that I want to hear.

It does everything the Echo does, but the sound quality is not great. When you're playing at middle volume, it's ok. The lows are there but doesn't sound good. I'm guessing I'm comparing it with the Bose mini soundlink. When you set the volume high, the bass is almost non-existent. The mids and highs are loud with the louder volume. Another difference is that with tap, you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo, you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands.

I love this Amazon tap it is light, portable, smart, has a great dock so I don't have to fuss with cables, and it has a 9 hour battery life, so I can go all day playing music.Being a Google play music subscriber The only thing missing from this speaker IMO, is a way to wirelessly stream my Google play music to this device using Alexa that is built in. You can use iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, prime music, heck even Apple iTunes got some love, but no Google play music. Come on Amazon show me some love. I pay 15 dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and 5 family members access to Google play music and YouTube red. So it would be nice to use it on my tap.

All the Skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great!The fact that this is all available in a portable device that I can take with me everywhere I go is so useful. The Tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so I can use it anywhere. Unlike its non-portable brother the Echo, you push a button to issue commands to Alexa. On the plus side, you don't have to say Alexa. On the negative side you still have to push the button. I understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if Alexa was listening all the time. Amazon should issue a firmware update to allow Alexa to listen all the time when plugged in.The sound quality is good, not great. Other speakers in the $129 category sound better.

"Full disclosure. I own five Amazon echos including a few Dots as well as this Tap, so obviously I'm a fan of echoes. Honestly I couldn't figure out from Amazons marketing and the online review how the Tap fit in as compared to full blown Echo and the Dot. I kept thinking it was limited compared to the Echo and the Dot because you had to Tap the button to ask it question. However given that it's completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would wast battery if it was always listening for a voice command. IMO, the Tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the Echo in a much smaller form factor. Since it's portable it's probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someways is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music. My friends and I get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown Echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays Michael Bolton over my Bruce Springsteen. Bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown Tap in a portable and smaller form. Very Happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

"The Ultimate Bluetooth speaker...I have multiple Amazon Echos and a Whole Echo System set up in my house. I Love Everything Amazon...I can't stand Apple but now I know how they feel...I am a Cult Member of Amazon!!! LOL So anyway...I have been trashing this device...The Tap...because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things I like most about the Echo. The only flaw of the Echo is it is not portable..I tried the Triby but I did not like it...more for little kids. So on Black Friday the Amazon Tap was on super sale so I bought it. The Tap is smaller than I thought it was...about 2/3rd the size of the Echo..which is perfect for portability...But don't let the size fool you the sound is only short of Bose when it comes to volume and sound quality. Important note...You don't have to have an Echo to use this device...just The Alexa App on your smart phone. The Tap does everything the Echo does..It is an Amazing Bluetooth speaker...AND IT""S PORTABLE!!! Automatically switches/remembers different WiFi areas and can be used with a Hot Spot. The Most Amazing thing about the Whole Amazon Echo System is that Amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly. Meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does...Some things Even better than Google Now...and Light Years ahead of Siri. The Tap is my new favorite device...it is PERFECT!!!

"One of the best streaming devices available currently especially for the cost.

The new Fire TV has every streaming option that you can think of except VUDU. This is the only negative that we have found because we have over 100 digital copies of movies that have been either purchased or came with the blue-ray when we bought them. It is very convenient to not have to use the disc when we want to watch a movie. The Fire TV loses that convenience in that Amazon wants you to use their Prime service for digital movies. If you are going to subscribe to Amazon Prime then look no further than the Fire TV. If you have a large digital movie collection then I'd look to the Roku 4.,1.0,1.0,2016.0
This is the 5th or 6th Fire TV I have purchased. Now I have them in every room and have completely cancelled cable.

"I couldn't be happier with Amazon Fire TV! I had purchased the Fire stick first to try out. It, as well as Fire TV, are a breeze to install...fast, easy, and amazing. I have the voice remotes on all of them and it makes navigating outstanding. I'm using the Fire Stick on my bedroom TV and the Fire TV on my flat screen in the family room. The main difference is that the Fire TV has a greater memory capacity than the Stick. It comes with a lot of free films, programs, games (unlike the other streaming services), music for Prime members. The options available to kids (from toddlers to grade schoolers), are incredible and include both games and videos. It allows you to keep a personal ""Watchlist"" for those things that are you faves or that you want to come back to at a later date. There's so much available with this that I can't say enough about it. It also has all the subscription services that you can test with the free trials that they offer: Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, and much, much more. That way, if you're really looking to cut the cable, you get a great feel as to what's out there and how much it will cost should you pick a paid service. Even if you just stick with what Amazon offers freely (and they add things all the time) you still would only be paying for the Fire TV and nothing more. Definitely a win/win for those who are fed up with being gouged over and over by digital services. With this, all you'll need is wifi, and a TV with HDMI ports....and you'll be good to go.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

The only downsides are: you must sign in/create an Amazon account (which is free), it doesn't come with an HDMI cord (which is required for use), and it doesn't have expandable memory.

"Set up was easy, content is plenty. My only issue so far is that I use the Amazon fire tv for Playstation Vue, and the guide functionality is horrible. I'm not sure whether to blame it on the amazon fire tv or the playstation vue, but considering the guide is different between the amazon fire tv and the fire stick, I'm going to assume that amazon has some control over the guide for it's products. With that being said I'm definitely disappointed. Hopefully over the next couple months the guide functionality improves. Other than that it has been fantastic!",1.0,1.0,2016.0

"I owned a Fire Stick previously, but when I bought a 4K TV, I wanted a media streamer that could playback 4K content. I tried the Roku but ultimately returned it for the Fire TV because it allows CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) over HDMI, which the Roku did not. For those who don't know, CEC (found in most new TV sets) allows your remote that comes with the TV to control other devices connected through an HDMI cable. Now I only need one remote for everything and didn't have to go out and purchase an expensive universal remote.

The Fire TV has double the cores, double the RAM and has a slot for memory expansion when compared to the Fire Stick. Of course that all comes at a price, but its worth it. The Fire TV does not buffer nearly as often as my Fire Stick or Chromecast. This device is a 4K streaming device, but you'll need to find 4K content to take advantage of it.Cons: The experience from the get-go is VERY Amazon centric, with the platform optimized for searching and viewing Amazon video titles. I havent found the Voice Control to be of much use, as it is only really helpful for searching Amazon video.",1.0,1.0,2016.0

This FireTV is amazing in the way it can turn any tv into a smart tv. It is quick and responsive. We only using it for its streaming capabilities but so much more can be done with it. We also own a Firestick and they both seem the same for performance. So if you only plan on using its streaming capabilities you might want to look into the cheaper firestick.,0.0,1.0,2016.0

The nVidia Shield is great, and yeah it's powerful... and plays games, but for the price, and if you just want to stream it's not worth it. The selection of Android games is so limited, don't waste your money! I've also been turned off by the Roku interface, it seems too kiddish, and just not as intuitive. I am using these Fire TV devices through out the house to stream Live TV, and my movie collection through an app called Emby. It's a fantastic experience for the whole family and saves me a bundle on rental fees from the cable company, and electricity due to it's low power consumption.

"I am very happy with this device. I've tried many different solutions to get to a good cord cutting setup and this is by far the best. From cheap Android sticks, to Roku, to Chromecast, to small form factor PCs, this is the best compromise between size, performance, and price. We use it primarily with PlayStation Vue but also with Amazon Prime. Interestingly enough it has become our preferred device for Netflix as well, even though Netflix is built-in to our Samsung TV. The Bluetooth remote is very good, even though the voice search/Alexa services are little more than a novelty. To be truly useful Amazon needs to open voice search to other apps. I'd love to be able to say ""watch CNN on PlayStation Vue"". My biggest knock however is the limited libray of apps. For example, there is a free CBS app for Android but the app for the FireTV requires a subscription. Yes, you can side load apps but that defeats the simplicity that makes this device great. Similarly, the lack of Google Play Movies and Google Play Music is regrettable.On a side note, if you don't plan to play demanding games, the new FireTV Stick (quad core) is just as competent a devices as this one, for less than half the price. But I cannot recommend the old FireTV stick. One little advertised feature that I absolutely love is that the device will also connect to Bluetooth headsets.

Like the hardware. Both box and the remote control is very aethetic and nice to use. processor is fastest by the time I bouth it and still fast enough for my system.

I do like the Amazon fire TV. There are a few things I do not like. Mainly the layout of the menus amd getting around. To many duplicates displayed and to many pay for shows mixed in.

"I had this for over 3 months and I'm liking this more and more. It has a lot of potential. 1st of, hardware wise. It's the best of the bunch. It can support up to a 4k display, has an Ethernet port and a microsd slot. It's small and compact so I can tuck it way from sight. This is fast. Virtually little to no lag. Everything is smooth and responsive. If I did have to complain, it's the time to start up the unit from a cold start. 2nd, It's based of of Android so the potential to root and install a media player is a possibility. 3rd, rarely has any buffering issue. Why did I bring this up. It all depends on your provider. When I has FIOS and hardwire the Fire player to the router, it keeps buffering. I don't know why. I have 50 up/down. When I changed providers, TWC/Spectrum, I have Zero buffering issues. To me, I think FIOS is throttling HD contents.To sum it up, this is way better than the stick because of the hard-wiring capabilities. MircoSD slot for expandable and this is freaking fast then the stick. Well worth the extra $30-$40.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

The Fire TV itself is great for streaming various media over our wireless network to our TV in our sun room. At first we thought we'd have to get an extender but we got lucky and everything runs pretty smoothly. The applications are fast and responsive and the menus are easy enough to navigate for the young one in the house. The only thing we aren't happy with is that the remote chews through batteries pretty quickly.

"As a video streaming device, the Fire TV is great, especially if you're a Prime member. It's more powerful than most media boxes on that market especially if you're into gaming, which is where that extra juice shines.In fact, tons of Android games play great on it. You don't even need the optional controller for most of them. And there's something to be said for playing Candy Crush on the big screen. But for more serious games like Grand Theft Auto, Tales from Borderlands, Modern Combat, or Knights of the Old Republic?Really well. You might want to invest in a controller for some of them (though not all game support the controller natively so do your research!) they run very smooth, and without any noticeable frame-rate drops. Though, most Android games don't really push the hardware anyway, so this should come as no surprise. But at the very least, this does mean you'll be able to play top-of-the-line Android games for several years with no problem. Some apps have their own versions specifically for the Fire TV, so you'll want to make sure to get those ones if available.You also may be wondering what the difference is between the 2015 model, and the previous 2014 launch model. Well...not much. The newer box is capable of a 4K output whereas the older version only went up to 1080p. But since most people don't even own 4K TVs, this feature probably won't be too useful. That said, it is nice future-proofing, as 4K TVs become more and more standard, the Fire TV will be ready. There are smaller changes here and there, but I'm not familiar enough with the older model to say what is what.Anyway, if you're looking for a streaming box that in addition to offering the usual Netflix, YouTube, Hulu and (of course) Amazon, also lets you play Android games (and play them well).It's worth noting that you can't access the Google Play store without rooting the system to install it first. Though, even then only a limited selection of Google Play apps is even compatible with the Fire TV (as of now) so it might not be worth the trouble, especially when Amazon usually offers comparable, if not the same exact apps anyhow. But it's worth pointing out all the same.",0.0,1.0,2016.0

I have told some of my clients about the fire tv over the Apple tv.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
Love the fire tv! It's is fast and very responsive. If you have Amazon prime this is a must!,1.0,1.0,2016.0

"Ok so I tried the free trials for hulu, netflix and amazon. This device allows you to acess them all and many others. But don't expect much to be free. After your monthly free trial with amazon you have to pay for the whole year up front which equals to a little less then hulu or netflix monthly fee's. Amazon offers many movies for this deal but I noticed many movies like new releases and a lot of series are not free and the rent prices are higher then red box. This device is also better if you have cable already because you can link it to your regular cable feeds. It is a bit complex and you have to down load all kinds of things. But the device is made as good as an iphone maybe better I was impressed with the hardware and the boot speed, but be prepared to invest in more bandwidth to run this device smoothly. When I watch anything on it I make sure everything else that feeds from the modem is offline.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
I bought it as a Christmas gift and the person enjoys it.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
The processor and speed of this unit is unparalleled. As long as you have fast enough wifi (and a docsis modem) you will only get signal loss once in a great while; and it won't be the FireTv's fault. Love the plethora of apps available for various channels and the use of SlingTv with this box is a great option in place of cable/satellite.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
They advertise zero lag time. Does still need to buffer,1.0,1.0,2016.0
Great product built structurally solid no issue and purchased 2.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
I have so many different apps that I use to watch my movies and TV and this device groups them all. The remote makes searching a breeze and Alexa is entertaining to talk to. I would get multiple of these. Amazon is adding a LOT of great features to prime. Oh and I hope you have PRIME when you get this. If you dont your wasting money. Get prime and get the fire TV,1.0,1.0,2016.0
Great product. Easy to use and operate. Would recommend,0.0,1.0,2016.0
"I purchased this device because I had the stick and I loved it. I knew this one has a faster processor, it would handle third party software better. I enjoy this product, it's really fun to use.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
"Purchased the device when it is on sale, it is much better build than Matricom Gbox Q. Looking to buy another one when it is on sale.",1.0,1.0,2016.0
I love this and use it every night to watch just about anything I want.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
"Purchased for the TV in another room after cutting the cord. It's better than my Fire Stick, as this one comes with voice search and is ready for 4K. Best Buy has it on sale at $85, do recommend.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
"I bought this to replace my Fire TV Stick because the wifi in my house is terrible. I wanted something that I could plug an ethernet cable into and I am NOT disappointed! The speed on this device is incredible! Very fast interface and I get much less buffering now that it is plugged directly into my cable modem. I did have to upgrade my router and change out my CAT5 for CAT6 cables, but that is more likely due to the speed going to the Fire TV and not the product itself.",0.0,1.0,2016.0
If I purchased it at the sale price -- $25 cheaper -- I'd be giving it 5*. Amazon has a few kinks -- please focus on services I have setup -- but on the whole it's easy to find content.,0.0,1.0,2016.0
