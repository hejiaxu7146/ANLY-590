1.0,This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
1.0,"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
1.0,"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
1.0,Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.

1.0,"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
1.0,BestBuy delivered this on the day of release. Amazon still seems to be back-ordered. It is a great product. Nice and light with uniform screen and snappy performance.
1.0,Use it for what it is necessary. That is all I need.
1.0,Makes a great gift. My children love them and never put them down.
1.0,I like the ease of use and good support from Amazon. A reasonable price for a versatile tablet.

1.0,My Aunt is 86 and has never used a computer. She does not have internet at her house. But she loves to read and loves to learn and now will be challenged while learning to use her new Kindle.
1.0,The 8 In Fire tablet does everything my nexus 7 tablet did; but also has the added benefit of expandable storage.
1.0,outstanding replacement tablet for my outdated and overpriced iPad 2
1.0,"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
1.0,Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
1.0,I was unsure about getting a tablet but after purchasing the Amazon Fire I was convinced that I had made the right choice and have been very happy ever since. I was concerned that I had a lot to learn but it came quickly to me and I really like the screen size. It was a great buy!
1.0,"This product my not fully compare to more expensive tablets, but Amazon has made improvements that provide a platform to watch media and read. Further, Amazon has made significant strides to provide a music platform which also improves the value of this tablet."
1.0,BOUGHT MINE ON BLACK FRIDAY AND IT IS AWESOME. MY FIRST TABLET AND IT IS GREAT WITH ALL OF THE AMAZON FEATURES.
1.0,It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
1.0,I am glad that I made this choice for both my kids: they love this gadget it has things for them to learn and play. Great thing about this is customized content for children
1.0,Great tablet for kids to use! Play games or read books and isn't slow.
1.0,Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
1.0,I am a book addict and this is my 4th kindle device. This is by far the best one. It is so compact it is almost smaller than my large wallet. Can fit anywhere. Holds a charge incredibly well and very nice display to make reading fun.
1.0,very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
1.0,"Easy to set up, great picture love it! Keeps my kids entertained and they love it also ....it was a gift."
1.0,Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
1.0,The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
1.0,Great stuff to have. It is a good tool to help your kids go out and find knowledge! And this does help. Wanting knowledge should still be encourage.
1.0,"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
1.0,"I received this as a gift after my original Kindle Fire started giving me trouble after 4 1/2 years and wouldn't hold a charge. This new Kindle Fire 8 is fantastic! The larger size makes it easier to read. The ""buttons"" are better than the old one. I like that is has more ""perks"", i.e. camera, that my old one didn't have. It's nice to be able to read, play games, browse the internet, or check email or take photos. The battery lasts for days! I definitely recommend this."
1.0,"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
1.0,This is a great gift for my 6 year old nephew. He will enjoy it for hours.
1.0,"I enjoy my Kindle immensely, so much better than having to start up my computer."
1.0,Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
1.0,This is a great device for my sons games since he was always using my iphone.
1.0,Has all of the functions of the expensive iPads and works great for fraction of the cost!!!
1.0,"I bought my Fire HD just for reading. I have a Kindle Unlimited membership and wanted to keep all my books in one place. This is an amazing little tablet. How Amazon can sell these for only $89 is beyond me. And I got mine on Black Friday, so it was only $59! At that price it was a downright steal. I had the first Kindle Fire. This model is better in every way imaginable. I also own an iPad Pro 9.7"". I don't try to compare the Fire with the iPad, they are completely different devices. But for what the Fire is, I love it every bit as much as I love my Pro!"
1.0,"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
1.0,I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
1.0,While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
1.0,"I've been a kindle owner since the early days and when new versions have come out in the past, it was usually a no-brainier to upgrade. The oasis was a little challenging because the price really makes you stop and think if this upgrade is worth it. After a lot of thought, the factor that convinced me to switch was the reappearance of the page turning buttons. I missed them since they vanished with the kindle keyboard! The paper white and the voyage were great devices but I often accidentally changed pages if I accidentally pinched the bezel when carrying the device or even just shifting positions on the couch. The Oasis' buttons have removed that issue and I am delighted! The weight and thinness of the device are also appreciated tho the paper white etc are pretty thin already. The addition of the cover is interesting but after a month's use I think it's pretty clear the cover/battery is there only to boost the very short-lived battery in the kindle itself. ""Months"" of battery life just seems impossible unless you keep the screen at low illumination and only read a few minutes a day. The screen is clear and bright, I can't see any LED issues others have complained about and the interface does seem snappier than older versions. Ultimately the only real justification for buying this kindle is if you miss the page turn buttons and want to pay top dollar for them. Otherwise, the existing kindles will meet your needs."
1.0,Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
1.0,Works very well. Easy to carry around & connect to wifi.
1.0,These are excellent to keep on the coffee table or taking along on a trip. Can't beat the price.
1.0,Got this thing around Black Friday and only paid about 50 something bucks. Awesome equipment you can actually stream the web very glad I bought it can't believe it so inexpensive!
1.0,Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
1.0,"This Fire HD 8 is my first such device. I find it to be easy to operate and very responsive.The touch screen control takes getting used to as I often click on the wrong close part of the screen and have to go back. The Alexa voice assistant surprised me when she announcedherself over the speaker. (I shut her off since I'm not a fan of conversing with computers).My main complaint is that comes with nothing but a charger and cable. The wordless, pictorialstart up instructions were primitive and vague. There are no instructions on how to use thisdevice; no sample book to test and get familiar with. There is a help function thatfills in some basics of functionality but not thorough enough. The WiFi connectivity is great, using the latest protocol and encryption. It has a simple web browser but web time also seems to be the greatest drain on the battery. The cable can be used toattach to a Windows PC and transfer files (books, music, pictures etc). I would also recommend buying a protective case for if its ever accidently dropped."
1.0,I love the snap on cover that charges the kindle. It is also very light.
1.0,It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
1.0,Gift for my mom and she absolutely loves it. It was exactly what she wanted.
1.0,Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
1.0,Easy to use with great picture. I would recommend it to a friend.
1.0,I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
1.0,So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
1.0,"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
1.0,You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
1.0,"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
1.0,It's very good product and I recommended this to buy it.
1.0,"This Fire tablet is a nice upgrade to the one I purchased 3 years ago. The screen is great, it is very fast, has lots of storage with the SD card, and just an all-around good product. And a great value."
1.0,"Only cost me $59 at Black Friday. Good deal. Way cheaper than an iPad of which I have several. This was for my young kids. The only knock I have has to do with the you tube kids app for this vs apple products. On apple, you tube kids allows you to speak your search. You only have the option to type the search in for this which is problematic for young children who cannot read or write"
1.0,My wife loves her Fire Hd8 she had one of the older models so i up graded her to this new model and she feel in love with it right away
1.0,Lots of good features for the Amazon member. Tablet is nice and fast.
1.0,All I wanted was a Kindle to read books. I got this instead!! Excellent choice because I can read books and do so much more!!
1.0,I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
1.0,"It's a really great tablet. It even has Amazon Alexa built in, so I don't have to buy Echo or Echo Dot. I originally bought it to use as a MP3 player but has so many features, I haven't added any music to it."
1.0,Great battery life and picture quality. The camera is not the greatest but I often don't use it for the camera. I usually have my phone with me so I use that instead. Can hold a lot of books too.
1.0,The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
1.0,"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
1.0,Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
1.0,"This tablet is excellent considering the price. It has a very clear display, is a fairly large tablet, and has plenty of memory to store a lot of apps, music, pictures and more. Considering the price, this tablet has the best value out of all tablets to date in my opinion."
1.0,"it would be nice to have full app library, but it does what you need"
1.0,Bought for my wife to upgrade from the original Kindle that she has worn out. Big step up from the original and should be good for another 8-10 years.
1.0,"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!"
1.0,bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
1.0,"Clear screen, color and size, grandson loves to play games on it and I like to have it with me to view emails during commercials while watching tv."
1.0,Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.
1.0,I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
1.0,"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
1.0,For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
1.0,"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
1.0,I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
1.0,I need a table that had more memory to start with. This fit the bill. I had a kindle before but mine did not have a camera like this one . This make it easier to capture picture instead of having to stop and use my phone.
1.0,Perfect price for the tablet and recommend for kids who don't take care of electronics. Purchased a I-Pad and the kids broke it and was out $600.00. If they break the tablet I can purchase another on at the low cost at Best Buy.
1.0,I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
1.0,Picked this up during Black Friday and for the price is a great starter tablet for my kids
1.0,I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
1.0,Bought this for my niece for Christmas. I'm sure she will love it!
1.0,Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
1.0,Great tablet/e-reader. You can do a lot on this bad boy!!
1.0,"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
1.0,"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
1.0,It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
1.0,Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
1.0,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
1.0,Great quality and decent price. Love features and the fact that I can mirror my tablet on my tv with firestick.

1.0,Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
1.0,İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
1.0,I just like reading amd playing games on it..Better then those bulky computers
1.0,The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
1.0,My wife and kids love it. Easy to use. Great for the price.
1.0,The gift was great since I have a 10 I knew was a good present for a very deserved person!
1.0,I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
1.0,"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
1.0,I am very happy with this tablet. It's a good size for me and easy to read and use.
1.0,Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
1.0,Love the kindles. This was a gift and a great value. I have one myself.

1.0,I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
1.0,This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
1.0,Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
1.0,I was pretty impressed with this little device. It was easy to setup and works rather well. I had also bought a IPad Air 2 with 128GB during BF for $375. After playing around with the HD Fire I returned the Air 2 because it met my needs at a much lower price. I added a 64GB SD card and am downloading movies from Netflix. The HD display is very clear. Battery life could be a little better but overall I'm very satisfied with it. The free stuff you get with an Amazon Prime account is icing on the cake. I dig it!
1.0,It works great for all my needs to check my emails
1.0,This works great. I read a LOT and I needed something that would handle all my eBooks. It has all the other bells and whistles as any tablet but I use it for the eBooks and one game. Excellent!
1.0,I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol
1.0,its the best tablet that you can buy for the price and you can add a memory card to it.
1.0,"This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"
1.0,"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
1.0,"Upgraded my tablet to hd, previous owned the 7"" regular. I wanted a tablet so my grandkids can use instead of using my ipad. A great xmas gift."
1.0,I wanted something for games and reading so I thought this was a great deal. I have enjoyed it so much. Passes a lot of time for me. Easy to download on too.
1.0,I had gotten this primarily to watch movies and run some basic internet programs. I have been very pleased to date with the speed of the processor and picture quality.
1.0,Great tablet for under $100. HD quality and it works just as good as any tablet.
1.0,"Perfect for teenage tablet, perfect for homework!!"
1.0,"This is a gift to my wife for xmas, don't know yet if she likes it but I can't see why she wouldn't"
1.0,Bought for college student as substitute for text books. Works great!
1.0,The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
1.0,Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
1.0,"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
1.0,"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use."
1.0,Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
1.0,"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
1.0,I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
1.0,We got a great deal on Fire HD 8. My kids love playing on it.
1.0,"Excellent value, lets me lug all my favorite books around and read whenever. Wouldn't be without it."
1.0,Very nice at a great price. Love Bose products. Highly recommend.
1.0,The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
1.0,This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
1.0,Purchased these for my grandkids...and they absolutely love them. They can play play their games to their hearts' content. They ar ed really fast too.
1.0,"If you're looking for a tablet to read books & surf the Internet, this is perfect."
1.0,"I expect my tablet to be a workhorse. Available to have two or three books open that I'm reading, hanging on to my email and ready with summaries of the news. The new Kindle Fire does it on a larger, brighter page. It is a work horse more than worth the money.. It goes with me might and day. I don't know what I'd without this gem."
1.0,I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
1.0,"I love this tablet! love my ipad , too, but this is much lighter weight and easier to slip in my purse. I went for a 32g but there were none in stock, so I got the 16 and a memory card that I will probably never need!"
1.0,Easy to set up. Perfect size. Easy to read font. Price was affordable. Great gift idea for the adults on my Christmas list.
1.0,I read the online reviews and compared products. Same price here as on Amazon.
1.0,"Purchased this for my nephew for Christmas. After reading reviews, I think this will be a good device for reading books and listening to music."
1.0,"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
1.0,"This tablet is great! Nice display, and you get the amazon eco-system. Now you can also download google play easily, so you have the best of both worlds."
1.0,You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
1.0,The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
1.0,This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
1.0,The 8-inch screen makes it very easy to use and read the print of books. Overall quality is very good.
1.0,Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
1.0,Great product...great price very easy to use...I got it for my nieces..they love it
1.0,"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
1.0,"Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
1.0,"I enjoy readi,g and Facebook using this item. I also purchased my husband one."
1.0,"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
1.0,Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
1.0,Great HD features. Makes it easy to travel with and be on the go and see all your shows.
1.0,"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
1.0,"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
1.0,Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
0.0,This is a neat little device but really not that good for much. I am sure it will improve in the future but I would recommend waiting it out.
0.0,"its good product but it has a big problem , the battery is the big issue for this device."
0.0,"I had to spend a lot of time figuring out how to allow apps from the Google Play store to be installed. Without that capability this tablet isn't very good. Amazon just doesn't have enough apps available. I did a fare amount of research on the internet to find the process for installing the google play store. I also notice that this isn't a ""snappy"" and ""fast"" device but I wouldn't expect it to be for $50. For the right situation this is a great buy."

0.0,"We switched from an older model tablet to this simplified Kindle Fire. For the price, it is a decent reader, which is primarily what we were seeking, but it has its limitations.The primary user in the house used it to read before bed. He feels the lowest brightness setting is still too bright, so he defaults his books/documents to black screen. However, words in italics default to the screen background, which means they are black. Doh!He also doesn't like the persistence of the Washington Post popping up on his Home Screen. He finds it a bit annoying. However, he doesn't mind the ads and suggested content from Amazon at all. it is just the Washington Post that he doesn't like.Beyond those minor things, it is an inexpensive and feature rich ereader. Being Amazon Prime customers, we share content between our accounts with ease now that we both are on Kindle platform."

0.0,upgraded my 3 year old kindle- same old. doesnt seem that great of a difference. the graphical interface still sucks but its decent for reading.
0.0,Kindle is good as long as it is plugged into a wall outlet. The battery lasts a mere 15 minutes as a portable unit. Not happy with this. Takes an hour to charge the battery to 100% yet drains in 15 minutes. There`s something mathematically wrong with this equation.
0.0,Don't like all the ads. Didn't know that they would be permanent because I bought it on sale. It's very slow and has trouble connecting to my wifi.
0.0,Hard to connect to the internet. Extremely slow to load apps. Not many free apps like apple. The only thing I really like is the protection it offers.
0.0,"This is an OK tablet for the price. Does is able to do a lot of things like a more expensive tablet, but I find it to be slow. I bought it mainly as a reader, so am not to concerned about the other apps, etc. Is handy to carry in a purse for reading on the go. I have hooked it up to public wifi and seems to work OK, did not do much as don't know if any security there."

0.0,"The Echo is a great product if you have money to burn and tech savvy. Alexa (echo) learns as you talk to it and ask questions. You have to go online and enable different skill sets to allow Alexa to answer more questions. As for operating smart devices this cannot happen wirhout a huge expense. You have to purchase wifi/smart bulbs and switches before she can operate. One smart switch or wifi bulb can cist as much as $30. That's pretty steep to me. On occasion, Alexa will begin talking when no one has called her to respond."
0.0,It came with dead pixels so i was very disappointed. i called then they replaced it. I ended up returning it completely because it was too slow.

0.0,"Was surprised by reviews I read stating this device had a great display. By no means is the display bad, but please, this device only cost $40. It does not compete with the iPad and Galaxy tablets. The Fire OS needs some sharpening up."
0.0,This device would be the best possible tablet for the money if it had Google Play. However Amazon chose to block access to it. This took their well made tablet with a beautiful screen and great performance from an amazing value to a waste of money. This is my last amazon branded product.If you use a lot of apps or want specific apps shop for another device.
0.0,I was not overly impressed with this system. I didn't realize you have to buy Amazon prime in order to use the functions. It didn't connect easily to my phone. It wouldn't just stream music saved on my iPhone. I had to download a music app and then load my music into the app. It wouldn't work. Way too much work and added expenses in order to use. Wasn't happy with that so I returned it and purchased a jbl portable Bluetooth speaker.
0.0,the app for that does not work well i haven't used it that much just for news

0.0,This doesn't power anything. I got this for my dad for Christmas and we just thought his Kindle was bad..nope..tried it on other things and it won't charge anything...I want my money back or a replace meant...maybe this unit is just bad! But 20 bucks down the drain!
0.0,"I'm constantly getting updates on how they are making the echo great. It will take time, but needs to also integrate with phone to send and receive calls and text messages. Hate having to tell it what 3rd part app to integrate with also. Good for smarthome features."
0.0,"It's a decent tablet, but keep the following in mind:- if you get this for your kids to share your amazon prime account for video and game apps, you have to lock it to prevent accidental purchases. Problem is that this prevents free app and video purchases, and you have to okay every thing they do. - if you allow them access to apps and video, then that can purchase anything without limits.On top of this, they lock out the google app store and refuse to even allow access to google drive. While you can hack it to add these basic features, you will need a modicum of technical knowledge to do so.So, it's useful, but a pain too. Your needs may vary."
0.0,"It's a good tablet, mainly because I order so much off amazon"

0.0,If you are buying it is a great price. To buy for you kids . They should come with a case for same price.

0.0,"Bought i, was OK but don't use it anymore for the price it is good though"

0.0,Battery doesn't last the up to 7 hours estimate. Didn't even last 4 hours one day. Watches video mostly but should last longer than that.
0.0,Good product for $50. External SD card is nice option.
0.0,I don't like this tablet as Android is not working well
0.0,This really isn't a very good tablet by any measure other than bang for your buck. I bought this for about $35 just to kill time on a couple of long flights so I didn't wear out the battery on my phone. I definitely wouldn't recommend using this for reading as the screen resolution is really below average and be tough to look at. I only used it to read some comics and play games on a screen bigger than a phone so I got what I wanted out of it.
0.0,"Very slow, freezes frequently but it was 34 dollars"
0.0,"I understand you get what you pay for but come on Amazon. You make millions a day and you allow this product to be on your lineup. The only thing this tablet is good for is collecting dust. In my opinion, if any company is going to integrate the AndroidOS at least make it user friendly and 100% open. It's basically like purchasing half of a device or a demo device."
0.0,Decent product that has great value. Definitely buy again for a gift
0.0,Nit sure was s gift not sure what the product is like
0.0,I bought 3 of them as gifts for my nephews. It was really disapproval to learn that they were already linked to my Amazon account. I started getting notices everything's they downloaded something. I had to literally unlink everyone one of them from my account before they made a big purchase (which they did purchase Amazon Prime-which I cancelled because I wasn't ready for a $100 purchase).
0.0,The charger don't fit in the tablet I called Amazon
0.0,They are ok for a kid to play games on. But I don't like it for myself. I will just save for an iPad.
0.0,"She is like my personal assistant, but I wish she is as smart as Siri... but since there is no one else like her, she will do for now."
0.0,Got this because it was on sale and I had a gift card. It is extremely slow using the internet. Hoping to be using it was an e-reader.
0.0,"I got this for my 88 year old mother to view pics on Facebook of her children,grandchildren,great grandchildren and great great grandchildren. With the kids protection bumper she is able to handle it well. The bad side is that I wanted to hide all the other apps and could not. Plus I ended up paying an extra $15 to get rid of ads."
0.0,The Amazon Echo is a great item. Sometimes the echo doesn't respond to the commands or cannot answer
0.0,"Each time that the Kindle Fire needs to be unlocked, an advertisement pops up on the screen. To remove these ads cost an additional fee, so be aware that this is the case. I have owned Nooks previously and they were more flexible in usage - such as being able to read epub books easily, for example."
0.0,"I got this so my son would have something to watch movies on while on a long car trip. It does that, barely. The $50 I spent for it was worth it. If you get an SD card for it you can load and watch movies. The Wi-Fi sucks and it sometimes doesn't stream movies from Netflix. Forget about YouTube."
0.0,I purchased 3 (2 as gifts) recently believing all prior purchases would be compatible with the Paperwhite. I was highly disappointed to learn that interactive solitaire and word games I played on the old Kindle Touch were lost.
0.0,If u have kids or just need a basic tablet this is a good 1 for starters. Only thing I dont like are the ads that show when u unlock it
0.0,"It is very good, but very limited to the number of applications that it can support."
0.0,"If you just want to watch movies or shop, it does the job. Not enough memory to do much else. But for the price its great for kids."
0.0,It was ok. You need Internet. The SDmini is a hassle.
0.0,Compared to the initial kindle this is a big impovement. Great for the Black friday promotional price.
0.0,"it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle."
0.0,"Not sure why, but it kept freezing and ended up having to return it. Very disappointing"
0.0,Truly I should have tried to get a refund. I threw out the packaging before I realized how poorly it works. This charger only works every third day when held at a particular angle. The planets almost need to align for it to charge my Kindle. Complete disappointment.
0.0,"I ended up returning this tablet. For the price, $40, the tablet performed very well. However, if you have the money, do yourself a favor and step out of the Amazon lineup. The iPads are great, in my opinion the best, but they cost $$$$. From what I've experienced, the Samsung Tab A line is a solid tablet for a $$ budget. You can often find one on sale for ~$150 and its a pretty good bang-for-the buck.If the money is your ONLY concern, then this will probably work well enough for you."
0.0,I I thought the buy For my child bc the kids mode but it was very poor
0.0,I was really hoping for this to take place for my phone with my kid. It did not. It works decent to stream videos.
0.0,"A little disappointed with my first experience with AI. You have to learn to communicate with Alexa to get results. I feel like she should have to learn more about me than I her. However I understand she is a GEN 1 and would expect that future versions will closer be to the Jetsons than something that keeps telling me ""I didn't understand what you said""! I doubt Amazon will update the existing units with better technology they will want to you to buy it all over again instead of making a loyal or invested customer happy. She does have a lot knowledge you just have to figure how to ask for it or download an additional skill/Application."
0.0,I was quite disappointed when I began working through the menus and discovered that my 2 year old Roku 3 was far more intuitive. Roku also allows searches of all of your subscribed services. If I am already paying a subscription fee to Netflix or HBO NOW and I can watch a tv show or movie without additional cost why should I pay Amazon to watch it? I am a fan of Amazon services and a Prime member but I also don't want to throw my money away. Roku is still the best.
0.0,Okay don't like the setup. I like Android way better. Cannot download you tube. It is for my six year old who has lost 3 3ds xls if he can keep this one from damage's for 6 months he gets an up grade.its very small
0.0,It gets the job done...................Great to buy......
0.0,"The last 2 models of Kindle HDX 8 have been terrible. We have purchased 2 of each model of Kindle and up until the last 2 models, they have been great. Last years had to be replaced 7 or 8 times and for the same problem. The slot for the SD card is defective. I gave up and bought the newest model. It shuts completely down if you try to plug it in to external speakers and sometimes it shuts down for no reason. It's going back after the first of the year. This is going to be my last year for Kindles unless they make them the same quality as before. Phooey!"
0.0,Good if use of tablet is low and not very complex. Color quality is only average.

0.0,Didn't like the return policy on this item. I couldn't purchase insurance on it in the store.
0.0,it does not charge any faster than regular charger.
0.0,"I bought it as a replacement for a broken tablet. There are several apps I'd like to add to it that are not available, and it won't update the Facebook app so I wind up using my phone for many things that I used to do on my tablet. If it wasn't a good e reader, it would be worthless, but I do read on it a lot, so I'm keeping it but I would still like a new tablet - which is disappointing."
0.0,Sad that I had to replace my original Kindle due to inability to recharge the unit. Now with this model the charge plug is a pain to use. Kindle please work on your designs.
0.0,"I purchased the Amazon echo a little over a month ago. I like the concept of the echo but unfortunately it's not as responsive as I had hoped. Trying to get local news is nearly impossible. It's also not in sync with my Amazon account. Packages I ordered on Amazon that are delivered, it will still tell me are still in route. I think the speaker is a decent quality and I stream music quite often. I probably would not buy it again. Too expensive for the limited things it can do. Again, I like the concept but it still needs a lot of improvements.It's advertised as though it will make your life easier but other than creating a shopping list for me, I have not had an overwhelming life enhancing experience."
0.0,I bought the Fire for my 8 year old for school after a suggestion from the sales rep in store. Went to set it up and it required a credit card number be entered. Couldn't even download free kids apps. Why would I want my child able to accidently buy something? I refused and thus not able to download anything. We will be returning it. Product appears best for an adult who likes to read books on tablet.
0.0,"I purchased this for my 4 year old to play. It was not as user friendly as described and VERY slow. It keeps pausing and freezing up, which is frustrating for anyone using it. I was told that I would receive 20 off of the prime subscription, however, that was not offered when registering this product. It may be good for some, but it was not a good fit for us."
0.0,"It will not charge in USB on computer, have to take it in."
0.0,"Alexa is OK for basic weather and turning on/off a light you have linked on your network. She still has some issues understanding basic commands and i would love to see skills from major airlines that allow you to check flights before you drive to the airport. The music sound quality is good and you have to be an Amazon Prime member to really see value there. Hopefully, in a year it will turn out to be a good investment."
0.0,"Got the nieces, wife, and myself these for Christmas. Figures they were cheap enough, so why not.These are functional tablets in every way. We haven't found any problem with them. The display isn't a hi resolution, so I wasn't expecting great. I've had phones and tablet with the same resolution, but never one that looked quite as lack luster as this display. They are OK for the kids to beat around with because they broke the last tablet they had. This one probably wont last much longer, but it's cheap. I wish I would have spent a few more bucks and gotten better ones for my wife and I, though.If you want a disposable tablet or color reader for magazines and such, you'll probably be OK with this.If you want a good tablet, think about buying a good tablet."
0.0,SPECIAL OFFERS means there are popup ads when you turn on the Kindle for games and books. I called amazon and they want me to pay $15.99 to turn this off! I am returning this and buying another brand of tablet. I am DONE with amazon they will never get a dime from me!
0.0,Has every feature a android phone would have. I mainly got it for Ebooks and it works great for that. However if your coming from a iOS device I don't suggest switching to this.
0.0,"Not as good as i though, but at least it does what it is suppoused. Very bad screen quality"
0.0,"I bought this Kindle for my 7 year old grand-daughter. I bought a warranty for it. I bought it in August, I have already had to replace it. The charger connection got loose and was not charging. Well, it has happened again. I will need to exchange it again. The problem is that I have to buy the warranty each time. I was going to buy one for her brothers and sister, but I am now rethinking that."
0.0,I am an old guy and I am having trouble trying to get the unit up and running. I decided I really should return it but it was past the return date. It is back in the box waiting to find time to try one more time or put it on ebay.
0.0,"Bought these for my kids for the holidays. No you tube app installed, so you have to find a 3rd party substitute. Ads pop up all the time, with an option to remove them for $15. Amazon states that since I purchased the tablet on sale for $15, this is how they can afford to compensate for that revenue. I would have returned them had we been able to find the receipt.Maybe a good product, but not for us."
0.0,Bought it as a toy for my daughter to play games and watch videos.
0.0,"Seems like a good value, though I'm not sure how much it allows Amazon to spy on me. Major problem, does not connect my WIFI at home. My Android and Lap Top connect; and the Fire connects elsewhere, not sure if it's a WIFI problem or a Fire problem. Will contact Amazon to see if they can tell. Otherwise I would recommend."
0.0,This is a cheap tablet. I bought this so that my kids wouldn't ruin another IPad by crushing it. This tablet can stop working out of nowhere shut off and never turn on again. If it doesn't have a case and you drop it kiss this good bye because even a light drop can destroy it.
0.0,If you want an inexpensive device to read Kindle books or do email this is it.
0.0,"Ouch. I bought this Fire tablet, and used it for about four hours, and left it on a charger. A couple of hours later, I picked up the tablet, and the screen was showing a weird 'ghosting' effect, and then the screen went completely black.I twisted the chassis and screen a bit and managed to get things working again, just long enough to do a factory reset and return the tablet.I'm sure I had a defective/damaged tablet, but I was underwhelmed with the quality, and it would be nice if Amazon brought back the higher quality HDX tablets, for people who don't mind paying more for quality tablets."

0.0,Does everything I need thank you. Alight small package easy to take anywhere
0.0,"I bought this and the kids version past Christmas. Its lack power and storage to be useful unless you want to just read books. Don't waste money on this product. The kids version is a good ideal but loading the apps, when they work takes forever. When they do work, the kids enjoy them. So I consider it to be a hit and miss. I'll be canceling the subscription as soon as my free year is up. Not wasting money on it."
0.0,"Difficult to purchase. No stock in 6 stores, no order online or ship to store available. When it did become available it did not work. Once it turned on, I couldn't get any further. I could not log onto wifi network, though other items in my household work. Also the product wouldnt move past setting up the clock. Tried 3 days, gave up and returned the item."
0.0,It's a basic tab. Only for reading. I didn't keep it.
0.0,"The reviews on this on Amazon seemed awesome. Little did I know that there is a chronic problem with the port on these tablets. We just bought this for Christmas and went to charge it for the first time. Nothing. We already loaded (and paid for) several apps, and now we're out that money. Also the charging cord that came with it appears it has been used before - there's some wear at the edge of it. So I went online to see if I could find this issue and there it is - everywhere. This is a problem that has been around for years, but Android - who is the ultimate culprit, has failed to fix it at the source. When you plug in the charger, there's no 'click' so you know it's in place. It just slides in and out. We've had Apple products for several years and never had an issue, then the first Droid product we purchase can't even be charged from the beginning. This will be going back to BestBuy - and will buy another iPad Mini - costs more, but is much much more reliable."
0.0,This tablet has a great price but don't let that fool you. The tablet performs much lower that other tablets I've used.
0.0,It was a nice tablet for the price. It's a nice beginner tablet and a good tablet for children.
0.0,"Purchased for my son's kindle fire , plug in , and get a message that charging will be slow. I bought an OEM fast charger for this exact reason , to be fast , not even slower that a 3rd party."
0.0,"Good bare bones tablet for anyone if that is all you seek. Do not expect the performance of a $400 tablet for $50. I have wifi & bluetooth going while streaming netflix and it performs fine, no lag on a reliable network. This is an amazon based OS, not a traditional android system.... so it is all geared toward amazon advertising and will not let you do much unless you register your device with an amazon account. It even asks for your credit card, but can be removed afterward. All apps must be obtained from their amazon app store, no google play store which is considerably simpler. There are ways around this of course if you know how. One more thing that is important and it is this... After more than a week, I finally noticed with more use that my screen has 2 spots with dead pixels which show up as solid white dots and cannot be seen unless on a very dark or black screen. After searching & reading online, it seems there are very many reports of these tablets purchased from any source having this issue. Even read someone who purchased a 5 pack and had several units with dead pixels. Test your new tablet right away after buying on a dark screen. You may be fine but it pays to look. I did not overly use my tablet at first and did not notice right away and though I still have the receipt, I already discarded the packaging. I am at the 14 day point today and could have still returned it otherwise, but honestly for all I use it for I am not overly concerned. Still whether 50 or 400 dollars, a brand new item should be free of defects. Again, so far I find it to be a reliable device if a simple bare bones tablet is all you need."

0.0,Bought this tab for the $40 dollar sale price and its a nice little system. Nothing worthy of note though I have to say I am not a fan of the amazons operating system. My wife hates the inability to delete preinstalled bloatware so the home-screen is not OCD friendly.

0.0,Can't be it for $34 to use it on the plane for the kids. Scrolling down is kinda sluggish compared to my phone.
0.0,"All I can say, as soon as I opened this tablet it never ever turned on, I was so upset as I've followed the troubleshooting steps from other users online and still it never worked, I fully charged the tablet and tried again and still it never turned on. I had a very hard time at the best buy returning this item; had to spend an hour and explained the situation to them; they never believed me this item came to be defective; after storming out and after a while; they have decided to accept the return and gave me credit for it.I would never buy an Amazon product ever again. piece of junk, bad quality product.Thanks,"

If you're looking for a top quality product at a bargain bin price, this isn't that."
0.0,horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
0.0,"I really wanted to give this device a chance but I did end up returning it. It's a HUGE upgrade though over the cheaper 7"" version. Honestly I don't think anyone should purchase that. If your budget can handle getting this version and you are heavily invested in the Amazon ecosystem (i.e. Prime member) this will make a great tablet. I think it is intended more for kids though than adults. Having iPads in the house we tried this with our toddler as a cheaper tablet for her but the interface and quirks of the Amazon OS just were not worth the hassle. Will end up seeking out a used iPad Mini 2 instead of this."

0.0,"I purchase a fire after my nook died. I had problems with the first one saying I was connected to the web , but not being able to connect. Took it back and the geek squad looked at it and after trouble shooting for a while, they decided there was something wrong with it, so I exchanged it for another one. We set it up and it worked initially, then I went home and the same thing happened as with tg first one. So I took it back and got my full refund . While not happy with product, best buy customer service made me happy."
0.0,"Got this for my 8yo daughter. A lot of the times it doesn't work, I have to restart it a lot, and it only has 3 apps that I added on it. It came with way too many pre-loaded apps, and the most annoying thing is that the kids profile is permanently horizontal. Not really worth the money for me, but at least she's playing her Inside Out bubble game on her own tablet instead of my IPad."
0.0,"I wanted to like this a lot because my Ipad Mini is ""heavy"" to carry in my purse all the time. This is so very light. BUT they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device AND when you buy it at Best Buy you are not given a choice to ""spend an extra 20 on a 119 dollar ""book"" or put up with their ads"". I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off. I don't find it to page-turn handle as well as my OLD ORIGINAL NOOK OR NOOK COLOR and certainly not anything like the Ipad Mini. If I hadnt kept it too long to return I would have. It doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to MANUALLY CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER AND GOING BACK AND FORTH IS just stupid...it should have been part of the IMPROVED design, THEY REALLY MISSED THE MARK FOR THE PRICE. i CAN GET A FULL TABLET FOR LESS MONEY THAT DOES ALL THAT AND SIMPLY USE THE KINDLE APPPROSLight weightSmall for purseback lightCONS1-comes preloaded with ads2-not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3-page control is not that simple4-t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one OR the other5-not as touch responsive to anything6-don't like the organization of it"
0.0,"I've been using a Kindle forever, and when it became apparent I needed an Android device (I have a Windows phone, which I love but has serious app limitations) I thought I with a Fire I could get a tablet and upgrade my Kindle at the same time. But even with Geek Squad help I could never figure out how to upload the apps I needed onto the Fire. So back it went, replaced with a Lenovo tablet that does the trick."
0.0,"I bought one of these on Black Friday on impulse since it was $34.99 and I had a $5 certificate to use. I have a third generation iPad and am quite accustomed to using it and the App Store.Pros: OS is Android based and not too hard to pick up compared to Apple. I did find versions of a lot of favorite apps and games to download. It can take up to 128GB microSD card for expanding storage (only 8 GB built in). I got a 64 GB class 10 card at Costco for $20.Cons: screen resolution is only 1024 x 768, but I can't say it's super noticeable in normal use. Not all apps available even if an Android version exists. Much more useful if you have Amazon Prime as it ties directly to an Amazon.com account, and In fact you have to register the device before you can do much of anything on it. Battery life is not impressive either, with standby time in particular not great.For the price, it's a handy spare internet connected device. I'm not one to buy Kindle books, but the ones I do have are certainly easy to access and read."
0.0,"I bought this tablet as a replacement for my wife's Fire TV HDX 8.9 as her battery life is starting to decrease as it is getting older. Unfortunately, she was not happy with it as the tablet is slightly smaller screen wise (the next step is 10"" which is way too big, and has 4 less hours of battery life) and I was disappointed despite it being a newer tablet it was not able to decode HEVC, like the Fire TV 2015 boxes we have connected to our televisions. This unfortunately is a show stopper, as we can't view the movie library we have on this tablet. We will wait until a newer version comes out that is improved."
0.0,Great affordable device but does not have allow for android market app downloads and is basically good for simple browsing and games.

0.0,"I looked at the reviews and they varied greatly. I didn't want an electric sharpener, so my choices were very limited. This pencil sharpener is adequate and suits my needs because I don't use pencils very often, but it is very slow and sounds like it's straining."

0.0,"It's very appealing for the price, but know in advance that the warranty is only 90 days... I did not. So when my sons device stopped charging due to a lose charging port a little over 2 months after he got it, I didn't rush to call. I have been taking care of seriously ill family members so I put customer service on the bottom of my list of priorities since I thought I had time,,, especially knowing that these types of calls can sometimes take hours which I didn't have. Today my son was home sick, so I had the day to do the things at the bottom of my list so I called Amazon. 52 minutes later, after doing all their trouble shooting steps THREE times and being disconnected once, she decided to tell me that my warranty was only for 90 days but she would be happy to help me buy one for only $49.99........ Ok. After I calmly explained to he that that was full price and I wasn't about to spend that again on a device that barely made it two months, she put me on hold and 5 minutes later she told me that they would generously give me $10 off my next purchase.Moral of the story, know before you buy & if you still buy, call the minute the thing breaks, even if that means your mom will be an hour late for chemo I guess.Also, during my 45 minute search for who to call about the defect (since it wasn't on the box) I found the Amazon support number on a thread with at least 200 other people talking about their defective charging ports. Keep that in mind.If $50 is something you can spend every 2 months, it might be worth it????"

0.0,"I got this tablet for my 2 year old after her previous tablet cracked when she dropped it, and wasn't too impressed with it. I had to wait about 3 weeks for the Wifi to be setup at home, and found out it was way too reliant on the internet for most things to work. After inserting the SD card from her other tablet I was hoping it'd be easy to view videos, pictures, and music and had such a hard time figuring it out. It took a long time for the videos and pictures to show up because I wasn't connected to Wifi, and it didn't recognize any music files. Once I did connect it, it was annoying to see that ads were displayed on the Lock Screen. Overall it's a good tablet, but I just didn't like all the apps that are installed and rely on Amazon's paid services."

0.0,"A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature."

0.0,"Used it for 2 days and the screen froze 5 times--the kindle just won't switch on. Had to restart each time, and sometimes restarting won't help. It is clearly defective. Brought it to a Bestbuy store to exchange, but custumer service won't replace it. Asked me to look on the kindle shelf and there was none. Then they said they could give me store credit, and I would go line up in checkout and order a new one. Since I got mine on a discount, I had to pay the price difference!! This is ridiculous. They wouldn't order a replacement for a defective product, unless I pay more?? Got a refund in the end even though I liked the product otherwise and would much prefer an exchange. I guess purchases with discounts are not protected."
