"All I can say is if you're looking for late night protein. And only late night protein, this is the place to go. There's not a lot of options cause everything's pretty much just meat this meat that. You'll see many body builders here. The price for the portions you get are unbelievable low. I was stoked that 13$ got me an extra large plate of pork souvlaki which is a meal for 3 on it's own.

"My car was involved in a hit and run and I went to Allard and I was pleasantly surprised at the attention to detail and time they took in making sure all my concerns were answered. They made the car look like new and even worked with me to get some customizing done included in the price. Locally owned +++, I won't go anywhere else from now on.",1.0
Nice weekly specials.  I wish it would be alittle more authentic but the steak tacos and the chicken enchilada nachos have a great flavor I like the enchilada sauce and the tequila list is great Casa noble and 1942 don Julio.  Great fresh margaritas and I usually dine in bar with great service and ambiance.  Fun place to take a date.,1.0
"Been reading through some of these bad comments and they are as made up as they come! Wow, liars. I've purchased 6 cars from this dealership in the last 3 years! 6 cars!! Why?? Because this dealership is outstanding! Everything about them has been professional and above reproach. If we had any kind of a bad experience, we wouldn't have purchased even one vehicle from them.
Their sales team is super! We've always been treated with respect! We go there for repairs and oil changes. They've kindly given us the use of loaner vehicles for however long it takes to make a repair. Brand new loaner cars! Who does that for a 4 hour job? Planet Hyundai Sahara, that's who!
They have never charge us more than the sticker, usually lower. They've taken trade-ins and swapped out lease\/purchase vehicles with absolutely no problems! I can also say that whatever price or agreement we came to, they took exceptional care of me, even on our first purchase.
The warranty is amazing! We paid for one repair that wasn't covered under the warranty. One repair for six cars. I'd say that's amazing! (it was a belt)
If you want fantastic customer service, the best product for the best price and a dealership that has your best interest at hand, you NEED TO GO TO PLANET HYUNDAI SAHARA. Just a great place to buy a car. I think I'll call them right now... looking to buy my seventh. :)",1.0
One of my favorite Mexican restaurants! We my mom's surprise 60th birthday party on the back patio and it was great. I've gotten lucky and always have had great service here. My only complaint is that I wish there was another one closer to my house (in South Chandler).,1.0

"I have heard so many things about the Free House Pub and I thought...hmmm, it is about time I tried it.  And?  No regrets!

I ordered their prime rib sandwich with harvati cheese.  This is honestly the BEST beef sandwich I have had in Madison.  (Technically they are in Middleton, but this  sandwich made up for the distance.)  The harvati cheese provided a nice flavor pop to the sandwich.  The bread was also well chosen.  It was on a soft roll, not too chewy.  My big complaint?  The au jus.  It was SO salty.  It was pretty much inedible.  Luckily, the sandwich did not need the extra moisture.  

I upgraded for $1.50 to the garlic parmesan fries.  They were delicious!  The fries were crisp, hot and nicely seasoned.  They came covered with fresh parmesan flakes.  Absolutely delicious.  The aioli that came with the fries was good.  Not great.  It was creamy and a little sweet.  The fries stood alone but it would have been nice to have something with a more savory flavor.

I paired my lunch with a beer from Ale Asylum Hefeweizen.  The beer and cocktail menu was pretty expansive.  I wish I had tried a house cocktail rather than the beer.  It was just ok.  

I definitely plan on going back soon.  We ate on the patio, which is gorgeous and nicely covered.  Whether you want something shady or sunny, you can find it.",1.0
"Been coming here for awhile now, and I was also here for a soft opening or grand opening?? The inside and cake displays are amazing and very creative. Definitely worth the drive from the west side NV to Henderson. Thy best opera cake!!! This is the place for good sweets. Here they have a whole stand just for macaroons and cupcakes . Assorted flavor and some seasonal macaroons, there is always something new to try.",1.0
"$9.50 for a movie (afternoon movie) where you sit in leather reclining chairs is pretty freakin awesome, if you ask me!
Movies are such a rip off nowadays. I feel like an old lady....it's too loud, but jeez, it IS so damn loud. It takes a while for my ears to adjust to it.
The beers inside are $7....I guess it's not too bad since you are out. (go to barleys next door for a huge $5 beer). 
The bathrooms were clean here. You can (and we did) order tickets online. 
So, back to those seats. Leather, comfortable and super roomy. I dont mind paying when I'm that relaxed! There is room for your drink, and a tray that will hold your food.
It's far from my house, but I'd rather drive there then go to Red Rock. It's worth checking out fo sho!",1.0
"I'm going to start by saying, this is not your big box grocery store. This is a small local owned run of the mill, I need something quick store. 
If your looking for great specials and ample inventory to browse from, forget it. 
You get the necessities here. 

Why 4 stars? 
I think this little grocery is great for what it is.
2 Redbox machines! 
A great deli\/bakery! Donuts, Yes!!!!!!
The chicken dinner specials are awesome, and cheaper than KFC most of the time. 
It's close enough to where I live when I need something fast.

The meat dept. is great. They will cut you a chunk of something if you ask and they have a nice selection at good competitive pricing. 

If you browse through out the store you will also find blue tagged items that are on clearance. Who doesn't like cheap, half priced items (mostly canned items)? 
Yeah, it's food and it goes bad when know one is buying it, but you know what.....a lot of this food keeps for a long time and I enjoy a can of baked beans for 20 cents as much as the next guy! 

When I find something I want in their weekly circular, I enjoy that all I have to do it walk in, grab it, and the check out person scans their coupon in for me every time. That is great! None of this, ""do you have a Sentry card"" nonsense.

Ok so yes the service isn't amazing and the decor is outdated but the dim sum was cheap and tasty. The only thing that bothered me was that they charged for the tea.,1.0

"I would consider this a neighborhood bar.  But I can see people from outside the area coming here because there are many good things about it.  
The atmosphere is  in no way pretentious.  Yet it is a bit more upscale than your average neighborhood bar. Service was really good. Always new when to come by and check our beers.
The menu had some nice regular selections you get at a bar. And then some other items like Asian shrimp tacos. Very good. Only problem was, the shells were really chewy and hard to bite thru. Someone else said the same thing.  Are they microwaving them? That changes the texture of food. 
Wings were oh so tender and hit the spot. 
Nice beer tap selections.  And good bottle choices.  It was not a rip off price-wise.  
One of the things I liked was the music room in the back of the bar with doors to go thru. So, as a patron you had a choice to listen to music or hang out at the bar and converse without screaming. 
This is a classy joint!",1.0
"I *love* this place!

I recommend using Open Table or calling for a reservation ahead of time because this place gets PACKED.  Somehow I can always get a reservation right away, but without a reservation there's a wait.

They have a really nice outdoor patio that I like in the warmer months.  In the colder months its indoors, and the building used to be an old hotel.  It feels like an old building.  Its a nice restaurant but it does look a little bit dated upstairs with the green stripes on the walls.

BUT---are you here to check out the decor or are you here to EAT?

I effing love Atria's food.  It's probably so unhealthy but I don't care.  Why is it so good?  How???  I strongly recommend the Miso Glazed salmon, the meatloaf, the pot roast, the goat cheese ravioli and their reuben's are to die for.  Literally you might die, bc they are so tasty they've got to be FULL of butter.

No one ever ate a reuben for their health.

The pot roast nacho's are OUTSTANDING.  In fact ,any time I want to get my Dad to come to Atria's with me, I don't ask if he wants to go to Atria's, I ask if he is in the mood for Pot Roast Nachos.  Turns out, Dad's always in the mood for pot roast nachos.

The only thing on the menu I don't recommend are the fish tacos.  I had them on Saturday and they were just not excellent.  Still tasty though!

The service is outstanding.  Our waitress this past Saturday was Daya and she was so pleasant that we'll ask for her section when we come back.

They have a killer cocktail list too, the Blood Orange martini tastes like angels squeezed it from golden oranges in heaven.  ???  Ok, I don't know what that meant, it is just a damn good martini.

Also, I spent my formative childhood years in Stuttgart, Germany.  Their Oktoberfest menu is HANDS DOWN the most authentic, best tasting German food in Pittsburgh.  I get asked where to get the best German food all the time.  It's at Atria's, during their woefully limited Oktoberfest menu.

The Chicken Paprika is ...  AUSGEZIECHNET.  WUNDER BAR.  Really effing good.  

Everyone in Pittsburgh eats at Atria's, but if you havent yet, you really should make a reservation!",1.0

This old fashioned ice cream shop is located in the up and coming Gordon Square. The ice cream is amazingly delicious. There aren't many flavors but everything is made fresh (my favorites are the coffee and cookes n cream). They also have fancy chocolates and phosphate sodas. I've taken my family and friends here many times and everyone has loved it.   It is a little more expensive than your average ice cream place but it's worth it!,1.0
Love love love all the sad flavors and this is the only place in town I can find Harry Potter candy and butterbeer :). My boyfriend loves the green river soda so we will back again and again. They are always friendly and now have a punch card for discounts! Awesome place for gifts and out of the ordinary stocking suffers and b day treats.,1.0
"I have to say, they have the best steak in Scottsdale. I would come here each time I was craving steak. I love the sports memorabilia and the fact that it's so close to bars and clubs. If you are in Scottsdale and want to drink a lot and not get a hangover, eat steak here first. They have great appetizers and great service. What's not to like about that?",1.0
"Stayed here for one night while road tripping in Arizona. The location is very convenient. There is free parking which is always a plus. The front desk staff was pleasant. I got a very good rate so I feel like I can't complain much. My only complaint would be that the walls are quite thin and I could hear the TV and conversation of the guy who was staying in the room next to mine, nothing a little background noise doesn't drown out. The hotel is clean and well kept. Free breakfast is served every morning in the lobby. Also free wifi which works fast.",1.0

"Great place for art and culture here. I never get tired of seeing the Dinosaur exhibit here. I thought an hour and a half would be enough time to check this place out but I was way wrong. Between the arts and history museum you need at least 3 to 4 hours to check out everything. 

We only put 2 hours in the meter and it took us an hour just to get through the art exhibit and that's because we rushed and didn't even see one of the rooms. 

We ended up having to rush through the dino exhibit which is my favorite of them all. I did manage to see the gem room though. The mirrors really make youfeel like the room is 10 times bigger than normal..So awesome!! I would definitely spend more time here next time and be sure to stay for at least 3 to 4 hours before hand.

They always have different exhibits on display as well as the cultural area where they show off ancient roman architecture like buildings, statues and walls. it was a great place to be, I even considered having my wedding photos done here.

"For a few years now I have stopped at True Essence to buy product.The shop is pleasant, smells fantastic (AVEDA)  and the staff is friendly and not snobbish like some Salons I have been to in the Mesa area. I was in need of a new stylist and decided to make an appointment. I called Thursday and was in on Friday to see Hayley who was well spoken, paid attention to details, paid attention to my hair texture, length, and skin tone to help me choose the right shade and tone of brown. We selected a color and the deed was done. It was a perfect job.I really could not be more pleased. I had read some reviews on Yelp for this salon before I went so I was a little apprehensive about pricing, but my color and cut were very reasonable. I was not charged for blow drying or anything extra that should be included in Hair Cut & Style. And I love my new hair color! I will absolutely return to this salon and maybe try a pedicure next time.",1.0
First time eating Korean and it was amazing! Bring your appetite. Each dish comes with little side dishes yep dishes about 7 for each order and a steamed egg!

Just going to the bank and noticed this restaurant. Never heard of it, really never noticed it ever being there. Was in the mood for some plain asada tacos with everything on it! They were great!

Such a beautiful ambiance! My good friend took me here and since then cannot stop raving about it! I even loved the glass ware! The lead bartender was attentive and easy to talk to. The wine was delicious and the couches  were comfy:) I definitely recommend going with just a couple friends or reserving it out for larger parties. Check it out!!,1.0
Fancy restaurant. Somewhat upscale. Perfect to come in after a wining night at the casinos! Or if you simply want steak. We were a group of 8 with no reservations and got seated instantly.  Greeter asked if we had reservations and when we said no he said he would still help us out. Although they can only seat  4 at a table they still placed us close by each other.,1.0

The stadd has always been friendly and the service attentive. The first time I ever had Pad Thai was here. I tried it somewhere else afterwards and then determined I would only get it here. Their crab rolls and spinach potstickers are very good. Panang curry is where it's at for me. I have had it pretty spicy here and have enjoyed every runny nose, too.",1.0

You literally walk outside of the museum and there it is! So convenient! Especially since we were all hungry. We chose to sit outdoors and enjoy the beautiful outdoor seating area, the kids had plenty of room to run around while we enjoyed a glass of wine and waited for our food...SCORE! We had the farm salad (arugula, fresh pear and Gorgonzola), fresh mozzarella\/tomato salad and kids stuck to a margherita fresh basil pizza and a pepperoni combination pizza. Everything was delicious!
We will be coming back for sure.",1.0
"You are always pleasantly greeted when you first walk in. I really enjoy the garlic chicken pizza and my kids are fans of the pepperoni or sausage pizza (depending on the day).

"I've been to Cornerstone a handful of times for both brunch and lunch, and I've generally had good experiences. I see many others have had problems with slow service -- maybe I've just gotten lucky, but even during crowded times, the wait staff taking care of us have always been pleasant and attentive. They are a touch on the pricey side, but I think their food is generally high quality. 

For brunch, I'm a big fan of the cinnamon pancakes with red potatoes on the side. Their pancakes are moist, tender, and generously swirled with delicious cinnamon and sugar flavor. The red potatoes are well-cooked, flavorful, and not too greasy, so they don't sit in your stomach like a gut bomb as soon as you eat them. For lunch, I'm partial to their veggie burger with sweet potato fries. They immediately get brownie points for offering sweet potato fries as an option instead of regular fries, and they're tasty to boot. The veggie burger is delicious, and you can actually see pieces of bean, quinoa, corn and veggies scattered throughout the burger. I appreciate a good homemade veggie patty instead of some artificial, processed Morningstar nonsense.

As a bonus, the steam that comes out of the vent from the side of this building smells insanely good. Like, when I'm walking my dog around the neighborhood and we pass by here, we both (my dog and I) stop and just take in the delicious aroma. I don't know what it is, but it just smells like every tantalizing savory food smell combined into one. I probably look like a lunatic, but I don't care, because free smells = awesome.",1.0
"I brought clients here on a Thursday evening for dinner around 800 pm. I recommend reservations since  the place gets busy. My clients who arrived from Denver around a year ago and never experienced Mastro's previously so I knew they were in for a treat.

We started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  I indulged in the pretzel bread yum! We ordered a few appetizers - scallops, crab cakes and ordered our starter salads. I opted for just the 1\/2 salad of the iceberg wedge - it's plenty large and so yummy. For my main entree I went for he rack of lamb and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. Everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! My lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as I expected. The only con was nobody had room for buttercake!

I received a telephone call from Mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. I'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!",1.0
"This place is cool. Super friendly they are really trying to grow the craft beer community in Charlotte. Lots of great beers and feel free to combine them for more options. With local regulations the only food is from a food truck in the parking lot but they usually have a good truck parked out there. Great spot to meet friends, listen to music or just drink great local beer.",1.0
"This place is okay.  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but I would consider eating here again.  I thought it was a little expensive for what you got.  We had a greek salad which I asked for the dressing on the side and did not get.  The salad over all was good and I would get it again.  We had grilled chicken with rice and French fries and should have probably gotten the salad instead of fries, it would of been a better combo.",1.0
I visited Marquee recently and was surprised by the amazing format. The layout of the venue itself is amazing. The best part is having both the indoor and outdoor section of the club making things different than most clubs in Vegas. Overall This venue is a must see as they throw a great party.,1.0

"I love World Market.  It never fails, I can find something at this store that I ""need"" to have.  From wall art to interior decor to kitchen items to gift cards to wine this store has something for you.  I love their card selection.  I've purchased more cards at World Market in the past year than Hallmark.  I like the variety.

There is a great selection of home decor items from wall art to furniture.  I'd probably decorate my whole house from this store...if I had a house...or an apt.  Maybe some day...

I also love looking at all the dish and glassware.  I'm a sucker when it comes to this stuff, as well as kitchen gadgets.  I am a bit of a kitchen  gadget \/ appliance whore.

The back of the store has fun lights \/ lamps, baskets, and of course there is the international food items.  If you're ever looking for stocking stuffers or a Easter basket filling, step on over to World Market and check out their candy \/ kitch stuff in the back of the store.  There's bound to be something interesting you can throw in your gift!

"I found this restaurant thanks to yelp. Lived in Cleveland a number of years without ever knowing it was here, Called for a reservation and talking with Junior was like making a new friend on the phone.

Arrived hungry at 3 when they opened with no preconceived ideas, which I recommend all first-time diners do here. You know about the relaxed atmosphere and long wait so don't come and then complain on yelp.

Had planned to have Gumbo, Etouffee and Jambalaya but ended up with Chicken Remoulade and Jambalaya. I had to close my eyes when I tasted both as it was so good I'd only dreamed of Cajun\/Creole food being so delectable.

Did not order any alcohol. I wanted to stay on my chair! Nor did we have rum cake. Couldn't hold another bite.

Junior's place is larger than a reviewer mentioned (5 tables.) It could easily hold 25 diners and a group will make for a fun time. This wonderful man cares deeply about his food, his restaurant and his guests. I admire him for who he is and what he does.",1.0
"Every time I go to this museum, I feel lucky to have access to such a beautiful museum at no cost.  They have all different kinds of art and you can spend hours upon hours here. I enjoy the impressionism paintings and the asian art collection.  My favorite is the armory room for some odd reason.  They also have an app and a huge touchscreen wall so you can learn more about their art pieces. They also have a neat interactive children's area.  I've been to a couple of special exhibits, most recently the yoga exhibit over the summer. Definitely worth the cost of the ticket.  This is a must-see in Cleveland!",1.0
"During my trip to Las Vegas, our friends brought us to Vitner Grill for a lovely dinner.  The location is in a business area and may be easily missed, but find this place...it's worth it. First, the atmosphere is a throwback to a bygone era. I love the seating, the colors, the old movie snippets.  Our waiter, Michael, provided exemplary service.  He was engaging, knew the menu well and was fun!  Our party of four began with wine flights and glasses of wine along with a plate of fromage and carne. The duck was amazing!  I was happy my favorite sauvignon blanc from New Zealand was served here.  I loved how the butter was served molded into two wells filled with herbs.  The bread was tasty especially the cranberry -bacon and olive bread! Next my husband and I shared the Caesar salad wrapped in prosciutto. So good!  Our friends shared a Caesar salad as well. For our entrees, my husband and girlfriend had the sea bass, I had the halibut and my other friend had the scallops.  All the entrees were delicious (yes, I tasted them all!). I think I would order the scallops next time as they were huge and cooked to perfection. For dessert, my friends ordered the Turkish coffee cheesecake. We were too full to order dessert, but did nab a taste of their delightfully rich dessert...yum!  Everything we ate was not only pleasing to the eye in the presentation, but was pleasing to the palate.  I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you are staying close by at the Red Rock Casino Resort.",1.0
I could probably eat 3 or 4 pounds of seafood here.  The seasonings are great and the seafood is pretty fresh. Prices are affordable. You won't catch me wearing a bib though.,1.0
"Lighting was really poor, menu description really small, thank goodness for flashlight app. Filled up a little to much on chips and salsa. First brought out soup that was good but all it was is broth. Service slow but they did stop by our table to ask if everything was OK. Good was good, I had Chili Colorado and it was cooked perfectly. I would recommend it if you on that side of town.",1.0
the spaghetti dinner is huge-en0ugh for 2 people. very tastey and flling. the calzones are also great-also enough for 2 peny and miss the ricotta\/mozzarella calzonesople. i grew up in ny and miss the rocotta csalzones that are sols on the street corners. the service is also great at pizza heaven and i really like the hometown atmosphere,1.0
"Beer and coffee together, how could it be better than this? Whenever I travel, I always look for independent coffee places\/local brew type establishments. This was two for the price of one. Very cool decor, comfortable, staff is ridiculously friendly, but not in an overbearing way at all. 

They work with Cartel Coffee, which I had earlier in the day in downtown Phoenix and I can attest to the fact that it's really good stuff, even for the coffee snobs among us.

I chose from the fairly extensive beer menu and really combined the coffee and beer idea with Cartel's coffee stout (not sure that's the exact name, but you get the point). It was a perfect way to spend a late afternoon in Scottsdale... and it's nicely tucked away from the craziness of Old Town Scottsdale. 

I can't wait to come back.",1.0
$6 cover change but Yelp had a 50% discount available tonight.  Good music but classics more than modern stuff.   It's lots of fun.   I don't think they serve food so good thing we ate before coming.,1.0

"Thanks to Brian and the rest of the gang at Syn Shop. I contacted them to visit with a group of educators, artists, mathematicians, scientists, and techies. They were completely welcoming and INSPIRING! 

From arts & crafts to programming and woodworking, this diverse group of makers share a collaborative spirit and a drive to explore and innovate.",1.0
"The employees were incredibly friendly and helpful, even offering a suggestion to my 12 year old daughter who is a bit picky with foods. We had the #35 and #20 and both were delicious! I thought the portion size was right on, especially since it also comes with a side. Sure you could spend a dollar or two less at a fast food drive through but this is is quick, casual dining with high end taste and ingredients. Also, we always love finding a local spot that is family friendly and satisfies our foodie palettes!  Definitely will be coming back to Zookz and recommending to others for both the food quality and excellent service.",1.0
"Beautiful facility, caring teachers, and happy kids!

My husband and I are lucky enough to have mothers that have been willing to care for our two-year-old since she was a baby. We didn't ""need"" day care necessarily, but we wanted to give our daughter the opportunity to interact with kids her own age. (We take her to the park sometimes, but it's not the same as daily structured interaction.)

We toured four different daycares in the area with our daughter. Tutor Time had the best facility by far, and during the tour our daughter played with the other kids in her would-be class. The teacher even took time out to get to know her before we made our decision to enroll.

Because we already had ""free"" daycare from our family, we only wanted to enroll her a couple days a week. Our daughter currently attends two half days a week. She loves circle time, playing on the playground, and snack time and naptime. The first few days she was there, I was able to call and they'd patch me directly through to her teacher for updates on how she was holding up. For the first month when she'd get there each morning the teacher would let her sit on a chair and get settled in before interacting with the other kids. Now that she's more comfortable, she marches right in and starts her day playing. I appreciate that the teachers took the time to get to know her enough to know what she needed in order to really thrive in the class. Now our daughter always gushes about what she did each day when we pick her up. As a bonus, they also give daily reports of how many times they went potty\/had a diaper change, what their activities were for the day, and what they ate for lunch.

I highly recommend Tutor Time! :)",1.0
"I've had the best thali of my life at this small, friendly restaurant on Somerled. Under $10 you can have almost half a pound of delicious food ! What I liked the most was the choice of dishes available to include in our thali and the possibility to have it more spicy. Also, the service is really quick and the people are so kind ! And they deliver!!! :)",1.0
"I liked this place.  The food reminded me of Thai cuisine with it's curries and tropical influences. 

Met a group of about 10 friends, and everyone ordered different items that we all ended up sharing.  There was a giant Lazy-Susan in the middle, which made it easy to share. 

I ordered the first item on the menu, which was the Roti Canai.  It's a thin pancake accompanied by a small bowl of a curry, coconut broth for dipping. It was a little spicy too, which I loved. 

Then I ordered the first dish in the noodle section called Char Kway Teow. This actually turned out to be my favorite dish of all the dishes I tried. 

I don't know all the names, but on the table were a couple of curries, a beef and a chicken, some chicken feet and noodles, a duck noodle soup, basil chicken, a shrimp dish with way too many onions, sizzling beef, and another Char noodle dish. 

I liked all the dishes, but was lucky enough to have chosen my two favorite. 

Oh yeah, and the prices were super cheap too!!",1.0
I personally have had nothing but amazing experiences with PLRG. The staff has always been super friendly and helpful but not up in your face pushing product. I like my space when I am shopping but if I have a question they are there to help. The perfect combination in customer service.,1.0

"great food and service (and the decor is clever!) 

things we liked:
- foie gras slider: this is small and expensive but so tasty!! my favorite thing we ordered
- poutine: needed a bit more cheese curds but still good 
- lamb meatballs: good flavor and sauce
- truffle mashed potatoes
- lobster mac and cheese: pasta was very al dente with huge chunks of lobster 

other things we ordered that weren't great but still not bad: 
- seafood platter: fresh but nothing special
- steak tartar: a little bland
- welsh rarebit: basically soggy cheesy bread but a little plain and flavorless 

overall a satisfying meal-  would come again for that tiny foie gras slider!",1.0
"I came in here to buy birdseed and left with seed, laughs and knowledge about birds. 
This isn't a store where you can purchase birds. However, if you are a loving owner of a bird, this would be the place to board your bird. 

The owner Angie is the most incredible fun knowledgable person I have met. I enjoyed talking to her more than buying the seeds. I would HIGHLY recommend this place if you have an exotic bird.",1.0
"Love this buffet so much!!

We came here on a Thursday night for my friend's birthday.  From the minute we got here we were treated like special guests.  The cashier at the front was friendly and very sweet.  Our server Salem was also super nice.  She refilled our wine glasses several times and promptly brought us anything we asked for.  Even the kitchen staff were awesome!  They wished us a wonderful stay in Vegas a d sang happy birthday to my friend!  One kind staff member even helped us get a birthday candle for our friend.  

Some of the food highlights included:
The wide variety of veggies at the salad bar
The nacho bar
Beef Enchiladas
Fajita veggies
Sautéed zucchini and squash 
Spring rolls
Ribs
Dumplings

"Food
- The food was delicious

- Try the Kobe beef, very delicious
- Sweet potato fries were cooked to perfection
- Food came out hot and fast

Drinks

Service
- Always on top of each table

- Very casual and laid back; no need to suit up

Prices
- I found everything reasonably priced for what you are ordering
- The deal of the month is the only burger that comes with a side
- Otherwise, your sides are paid for seperately",1.0
"Shotgun Betty's now has a full service kitchen!  Went with the girls yesterday for happy hour and was glad to try their new menu.  Can you say jalapeno cheese curds???  Friendly staff, easy parking right out front, relaxed place, good music and I loved the patio.  I will be back for sure!",1.0
"Stopped here on a work related road trip. The front desk staff was very friendly and welcoming. They have a coffee and tea bar always available which is a nice touch when you get in late.

The only downside to this hotel is that the doors are quite thin, and I could hear lots of noise coming from the hall (but none from the other rooms) including people running up and down the halls, and lots of door knocking. 

Other than that it was a good place to stay (and I loved the Bliss products in the bathroom).",1.0
Real nice people running this business and that makes all the difference. Plenty to choose from and great savings. Looks like it is always changing so I will be back.,1.0
"Aria is an excellent argument for a 1\/2 star system. They're not 4, they're not quite 5, they're right in the middle. 

Aria is definitely a modern take on Vegas and you can see their efforts in the rooms. From remote control curtains and touch screen remote control next to the bed, you definitely appreciate the modern touches. The view was also great with over-sized ceiling to floor windows overlooking part of The Strip. If you wanted to do Vegas and never leave your hotel, Aria has almost everything you need -- but then again so do most other Vegas hotels. The Spa was cool, if a bit overpriced. Same for the Brunch Buffet ($100+ for 2 people). The service was acceptable for Vegas, but definitely not the 5-star you would expect from a place charging premium prices. At times they were very accommodating - quick room service and surprisingly good food. But other times, I felt like I was in a Holiday Inn - they couldn't bring scissors up to my room to open a package I bought at their gift shop. The lady at the front desk was friendly and sent up a little ""treat"" when we mentioned that we were in town as part of our honeymoon.

Overall I expected more for the price but you can't go wrong if you want a solid experience and are willing to pay a little more for it.",1.0

"Lucky's is undeniably the best brunch in Cleveland. The Mac and Cheese is fantastic, the Shipwreck is unbelievable, and the biscuits are the best I've ever had.

The atmosphere is also nice; its quaint, but has some charm that's unique to the Tremont area. It's also great that they support local farms by sourcing their ingredients from nearby neighborhoods.

Overall, it's a must if you're in the Cleveland area.",1.0
"I like the baguette with chili & lemon mayo, pepper-crusted turkey, goat cheese, roasted red peppers and a little of their chili sauce. Stay away from their roast beef as it's hard to chew.",1.0
Hot bagels is so delicious. They have a lot of bagels to choose from. Bagels are best in the morning in my opinion. I believe they are best in the morning because of cream cheese. Cream cheese gives me the trots so I choose not to eat it. But I love all the gluten that Hot Bagels provides.,1.0
Very authentic Indian restaurant. Really enjoyed the food but nothing out of this world to die for. The interior decor along with the choice of music could have matched the restaurant theme very well. Very pleasing experience all around.,1.0

A large variety of flavours including chocolate peanut butter, cookie dough, tiramisu, chocolate sundae, cookies and cream, mixed berry and ofcourse red velvet! The cakes are exceptional, as are the smoothies. The savoury food has room for improvement, but you can't go wrong with the sweets",1.0
"Great fresh sushi better than nobu. Service ok. Sushi chef awesome, I couldn't decide which sushi I wanted and was too full to get two more orders so he suggested that he give me one of each.  Awesome! Casual atmosphere so you don't have to worry about dressing up if you are just out to gamble.  My husband and I met some really nice people at the sushi bar.  I would definitely go back.",1.0
Ok so the highlight for me was the atmosphere and the prompt service!  The sushi was definitely above average and the cold\/hot plates were very good.  It is a little pricey but I guess it is vegas and inside an upscale casino so bring or win some greenbacks!,1.0

Oh and we ordered food at the 9th tee box and it was ready to go when we got there.  A+++",1.0
Yum!! I made the trek because this is at the other side of town for me. This was my first time. Delicious and something unique about these donuts too. I like Krispy Kremes because nothing compares. I just had Bosa for the first time this week. Bosa was good but if I was blindfolded I wouldn't know the difference between Bosa and Target Bakery. Good donuts however have a great dough taste and consistency. I guess it is a hybrid of what a Krispy Kreme and Bosa would be if they mated. The Boston Cream was excellent. I will trek back. I'm hooked.,1.0
"I really like the food here.  My standard is the Tacos con Carne Asada.  It;s very similar to Tacos al Carbon which is grilled meat, with rice & beans.  

I also like the bean dip and salsa they provide for free. Refills are no problem and the service when I've there (3 times) has been quick and friendly.  

The last two times there was a guy on an electric keyboard playing which was (ahem) interesting.  Depends on your musical taste, but played a lot of cheesy 70's toons.  Overall solid choice for Mexican, I'll be back.",1.0

"Although I absolutely hate The Cosmopolitan, I was really happy to find this place. Every single time I visit the Cosmopolitan I have a horrible experience. Whether it's the disgraceful customer service, the trashy clientele, the pathetic excuse for pool attendants-- it all sucks. So when my cousin asked us to meet her and her parents here, I was crazy skeptical. I was honestly just gonna grab a coke and eat somewhere else later. I'm so glad I didn't. I had the ""Gold Standard"" burger with Onion rings and it was, by far, the best burger I've ever had. My mom had the classic with regular fries and we both spilt an order of the fried pickles (which were also, the best I've ever had). For both of us the check came out to $63. I would have paid twice that much for a burger of that quality. Seriously just amazing. If you love a good In-n-Out burger, you'll love this place. They put ""Umami Burger"" to shame and need to be in a category all to themselves. I can't wait to eat here again.",1.0
"Great for the whole family.  Incredibly restored fire engines.  Lot's of cool things to see!   Definitely worth the visit.  You won't have to fight crowds either, because the last couple of times we visited, there were only a few other people tvisiting.  Wonderful photo opportunities.",1.0
"Thank you for listening!  A couple or three visits after a disastrous summer where they made you feel cheap, looked down upon you for bringing in your own bottle, and upselling the crap out of you (COME ON, TWO TOMAHAWKS FOR 4 PEOPLE?!

Our last visit was the night before the Rock And Roll Marathon, manager Xavier took care of us and pretty much any manager that walked by checked in on us.  Xavier did an excellent job always being there for us and checking in on us.  The food is always good but our server that night did need a little help with his culinary vocabulary.  Butterflying the meat doesn't mean cutting it in half. 

People who are reading, the meat here is not ruined by unnecessary (but sometimes yummy) stuff thrown on it.  It will be undercooked so it's easier to (raise) or get the temp you want.  Well done E&R, I'll be back soon!  And thanks again Xavier for listening.",1.0
Great sports bar and grill. We called ahead for seating for 20 after a ballgame. The service was quick and friendly. The food was good. The nachos are huge! The Irish Stew is comfort food!

"I have never been more excited to write a review.  This is the best dental office ever.  The front office is amazing, friendly, smiling, courteous, PROFESSIONAL.  WOW!!! My past experiences with dentist were nothing short of barbaric.  Something of the medieval times!!!  I had to hold my screaming child down not once, but twice, and I just couldn't stomach the thought of going through it again.  

Then we found Precision Dental.  Actually my husband found it through YELP reviews!!!  He took my daughter in first for a second opinion on a broken tooth.  They gave us a reasonable price, and it worked so well with her nervousness.  Dr. Lam is truly a gift from God.   There are not enough words in the English language to tell how much I truly appreciate that man.  He actually comes out and talks with parents over the counter.  I was so impressed that I brought my other children.  He was amazing with them as well.  My son who experienced the barbaric visit in the past came out running and smiling that his visit was just a minor ""touch up""  The smile on his face just took my breath away today.

I love the Sofia Loren art, and the unique gangster kelidescope art they have in there. It's beautiful and the pizza makes me miss Naples. It's a bit pricey but very good. Their service beats Settebello by far and their pizza, in my opinion, is better than settebello as well.",1.0
"Finally made it to Butcher and the Rye and it was everything I hoped!  It looks small, but there are lots of tables up stairs too.  Definitely make a reservation!  We went on a wedn night at 730 and the place was packed! They had a few wines by the glass and a large assortment of beers. Penn brewery makes a few special beers just for butcher and the rye!  Ask for a sample.  
I started with the beet salad, which didn't even need the dressing.  It was excellent!  My fiancé had the pig candy which he ate in complete silence bc he was enjoying it so much.  For dinner I had the trout.  It was also excellent.  It comes out as a whole fish, so be prepared.  It was excellently seasoned and had a yummy creamy sauce underneath.  The only thing I didn't like was that the cauliflower was under the fish and hard to get to, but tasted delicious once I got some.  For dessert they had a special s'mores deconstruction that was delicious!  The bourbon marshmallows were amazing!!!

I was told that they were booked up for a Saturday but bring it in any way and they would fit me in.  I dropped it off in the morning well aware that it probably wouldn't be ready until their end of day.  Mark got me checked in and was patient answering all of my questions. 

Couldn't believe the car was ready 2 hours later.

When I got there to pick up, Lorenzo went over a couple of things that I figured would have to done, so I wasn't surprised when he was going over them.

Out of my budget at the moment,  but at least it keeps me well informed.

Next time we come, we're def going to shoot for the salad bar too. We saw how popular it was and a quick perusal made the connection. The veggies looked crisp and fresh and the salad toppers were plentiful, no boring salads here. 

All in all, this is a great place to check out",1.0
"Truthfully, I would like to give this place a 3.5 star rating, but 4 stars it is. 

For some reason I was under the impression that there would be a far greater selection of freshly baked goods, and thus a lot more vegan stuff. And I've heard a couple of rave reviews so I was stoked for some good gluten free pastry action. 

There was only one vegan savoury pocket, and it was a very mediocre curried black bean affair. I had it heated up (they use a microwave), and the result was an overly soft, overheated pastry.  The filling was very bland, to my taste.  Quite disappointing, and just a wee bit overpriced for the product. 

The saving grace was a small but delightful cinnamon doughnut that made my mouth forget all about the bland beans that came before it. 

I think that Feast is a place that I would stop in for a coffee and a doughnut on my way to Trinity Bellwoods Park, but for serious gf vegan pastry cravings I will continue to hop on over to Bunners.",1.0
"DELICIOUS! We get the Gyro sandwiches two at a time so we can munch on leftovers later in the day. Their cucumber sauce is amazing & refreshing. They use fresh ingredients which is something you don't see to often. 
The Chicken Swarma is so flavorful.
Unlike some mozzarella sticks that can be greasy & not stringy with cheese, Falafel Xpress makes their mozzarella sticks crunchy and so cheesy! The breading is really delicious & gives you a tasty mouthful.
Even their new world sandwiches are always delightful. You can tell they take great care when it comes to making the food.
I don't enjoy hummus, but Falafel Xpress makes me a hummus believer. 
The staff is great, Amanda always knows who I am when I call & is always very friendly. 
Darryl makes a terrific sandwich & always loads up the sandwiches!

"I found this place by getting a groupon deal for oil change and have been happy w all the service ever since. They do a great job!what I like most is that they are honest and straightforward. They won't rip u off by suggesting to fix something that isn't broken. 
I wanted to have my car ready for a long distance trip and took it to Terry's to have them check it out. John helped me by going over all the details on what they will check and even gave me a printed list. To my surprise, John told me my car (2006 Toyota highlander) was in good shape and didn't need any work. I was waiting for him to come back with a long list but I was very happy w his honesty. I will definitely continue to have my car serviced here.",1.0

 No Muss, No Fuss Kind of Store! They do have almost anything you need, I do admit that I had to go Across the Street to Smiths for Fresh Ginger Root! But, they did have anything else I needed for a Quick Meal for Lunch or Dinner.

The Store is Very Clean, the CSR's that work there are Very Happy & Friendly! I haven't had any Problems in this Store.

"I have only used Groupons in the past for any sort of fitness businesses, because, admittedly, I cannot commit to exercise. I just surprised myself by signing up for not one but TWO years here. Their hours are great for anyone's schedule, and they've got lots of classes to choose from. Kind of stinky but I suppose that's to be expected from a place where you lose 10 pounds of sweat from a session!

"My absolute favorite park I've found in Henderson thanks to yelp! We used to go to the skate park all the time, didn't realize there was more to the park.So awesome & never busy.

I had the pork belly sandwich. It was so good. I'm a huge fan of Asian grocery store sub sandwiches and this is along the same lines but with a lot more options and much higher quality.

A must try!",1.0
"I've been wanting to visit their Portland St. location, but was gave up finding it in -26 weather, so I'm glad I stumbled upon their Kensington Market location!

Contrary to Dark Horse, the café that I visited earlier in the day, this place played more Shoegazery music.  So the atmosphere was a bit more chill as opposed to lively 'n social.

Had a Cappuccino and it had a nice, thick crema.  Very smooth.  I hope that I'm not losing my tastebuds, but aside from the crema, it's difficult for me to say which café was better.  The only difference seemed to be the atmosphere.

This particular location was long and fairly narrow.  Seating, especially with tables, are rather limited.  And in the warmer months, there's outdoor seating on the back patio.

Furniture was an eclectic mix of vintage.  Place was decorated in a 'Jimmy' theme, re:  Jimmy Hoffa, Jimmy Hendrix, Jimmy (James) Dean, etc.  Would go back!",1.0
"Not too sure why my previous review was taken down  but I love this restaurant!

Have been here a few times and recently came here for my birthday dinner with friends. We sat at the chefs table which was amazing for a small group of 10. The owners knew it was my birthday and had written ""Happy Birthday Jessica"" on the chalkboard at our table - a small gesture but shows how much they care about their patrons. The food is absolutely delicious and such a great price. They have a great wine list, and even have wine on tap - could it get any better?!?

The atmosphere is great - cozy but not claustrophobic, warm and unpretentious and they always have great music playing in the background!

Highly recommended and I continue to recommend to others when they ask ""Do you know a great restaurant?",1.0
"I was somewhat stunned to see a negative review of Splendid Fare.  We have worked with Susan and her team multiple times at our own events, and have experienced her services at probably 50 events over the past 20 years- ranging from private dinner parties in Akron's finest homes, to weddings and anniversaries, to fundraisers.  Every menu is thoughtfully planned, beautifully prepared and professionally served.  I have watched Susan's staff stick around long after the party to attend to details - whether it's soaking a client's fine napkin to eliminate a wine spot, or making sure a kitchen is spic and span.  

Her staff is always well trained and friendly, and they will all go to almost any length to assure the success of an event.  Her reputation as one of Akron's finest caterers is well deserved, and trust me, you'll be in good hands.",1.0
"I was with some friends one evening and they were shocked that I'd never been here, so of course we had to go. Wow. I've been back probably five times since and the hype is lived up to here. Dirt cheap, delicious, flat-crust pizza. You definitely don't come for the ambience or the service, you come because you're hungry and you want good pizza for cheap. Two large pizzas for $24? Don't mind if I do! The garlic oil is, as others have noted, the best bit. This, for me, is the perfect pizza: a blend between healthy, classy, simple flat-crust pizza, but with just the right amount of cheap pizza store ambience and oil\/grease\/garlic. Mmm. Large margarita pizza please!",1.0
"I usually don't write reviews but this one is well deserved. I hadn't been to the dentist in a while and I was very nervous to go in for my appointment. Since my initial visit, the front staff including the manager Ismael to the back staff with Dr. Zamani, they have provided excellent customer service in every aspect of the business. I couldn't be more satisfied and happy that I chose Western Dental for my dental needs. I would strongly recommend for you guys to visit this dental office - you won't be disappointed!",1.0

"I absolutely love Madhouse Coffee. I was shown this place from a friend, and this has been my go to cafe for awhile now. I've tried almost every drink on the menu without being disappointed once.

"Bacchanal Buffet, the highly touted buffet in Las Vegas I coveted. Family and friends have indulged. It was my turn =)

No wait time! Wednesday at 6pm. YES!!

I was seated immediately and my drink order placed. It was time to indulge. 

I scoped out each station, taking mental notes of what looked good. 
I decided on the seafood station for my first plate. 
My second plate was from the carving station (BBQ & Prime Rib this evening)
My third plate was from the cheese & cured meat station. 
Last but not the least, Dessert. 

My food rating of each dish:
GREAT DISHES
*Lamb Chops - tender, perfectly cooked medium rare, yum!! Get the mint jelly too. 
*Shrimp Cocktail - Big pieces of shrimp. Not over cooked like most shrimp cocktails, perfect. 
*Goat cheese with fig - wow, wow, WOW!
*Mushroom & Truffle Soup - this was decadent, creamy with that earthy richness, Yum!!

GOOD DISHES
*Oyster Shooter - the oyster was just okay, but the liquid it came in was delicious. Cucumber juice?
*Brisket - I asked for the fatty part, yum!  Melds in you mouth goodness. I didn't see any BBQ sauce though. 
*Polenta - the only thing I got from the Italian station. 
*Wagyu Slider - delicious. It would have been better with mayo. (Which I found after I ate it)
*Mango Pudding - the coconut jelly made this dish good!!
*Coconut Calamansi Dacqoise - I don't know what a ""Dacqoise"" is, but it was like a macaron to me. Lol. 
*Beignet - great with coffee, just too sweet. 

OKAY DISHES
*Raw Oyster - it would have been better if it was sucked better. The oyster was still attached to the shell and a lot of shell bits in the oyster itself. 
*Prime Rib - the medium rare parts were good, other parts were very chewy. 
*Creme Brûlée - not too sweet, yum. 
*Goat cheese with basil - good flavor!!

BAD DISHES
*BBQ Pork Spare Ribs - too salty & not tender. 
*Jonah Crab Claws - even though they were pre cracked, it was still hard to eat. The crab meat was stuck to the shell. Over cooked. 
*Mint Gelato - first gelato I asked for was pistachio, I got ""Mint"" instead. Since I ask for 3 other flavors, by the time I got to my table, the mint had started to melt and ruined the other 3. Oh, I don't like mint ice cream \/ gelato. 

Info: The plates are HOT. Super hot. Be careful. If you want cold plates, get them from the salad station. 

Service was good. 

Suggestions: it was hard to get some of the dishes. For example the soups. The clearance between the pot and the shelves on top of it was too low. It was hard not to spill the soup because the ladle was hitting the shelving. 

The flow of some of the food station was also a bit off for me.

I didn't get anything from the Chinese & Mexican stations, I was too full. Lol. 

The food here was good, I definitely indulged, okay, over indulged. Lol. 

Solid 4 Stars. 
Try it for yourself and decide.",1.0
"Visited this place for the FREE Dole Whip, but when we got there they said we needed to purchase an XL popcorn. This is one of the few places in Vegas you can find pineapple Dole Whip so we purchased the ice cream separate along with a small bag of popcorn.

Normally when I get flavored popcorn, I like to get something with chocolate. Unfortunately, this time my wife made me step outside of my incredibly small box to try their Birthday Cake flavor, which was surprisingly good. Not to sweet and that cake batter taste isn't overpowering. 

Overall, my wife and kids had a good experience. I was a bit disappointed that I didn't get FREE Dole Whip (reason for my 4 star rating), but I will be coming back if I'm in the area for the ice cream.",1.0

"Came here with my boyfriend for dinner. I had a rough week at work and craving carbs and booze. I got exactly what i wanted. Had a smortini and citrus crush martini I told you I wanted booze.  Bread was serviced that was piping hot with a crispy crust and soft gluteny inside. Fantastic. But I tried not ot eat to much of it or it would soak up my martinis and kill my buzz. I ordered Linguini with scallops, mushrooms and pesto however I don't like scallops so had they switched out for shrimp. They had no problem accommodating.It was flavorful and cooked perfectly. The only thing I would of changed was they left the tails on. I hate it when they do this! Sure other people argue they are edible. No they are hard exoskeletons of a sea creature, I don't want to eat the hard, ass end rudder of a sea creature. Other than that it was great. Drank a great red wine with dinner... yay booze and carbs! Boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his lasagna. We got the tiramisu to go so we could sit on the couch for the rest of the night with more wine for no pants time and a few episodes of Game of Thrones. The evening was a success! The food was great, the drinks were wonderful, and the server was attentive and helpful. The restaurant was very clean, classy, and well lit. I loved the decor.",1.0
"Finally, a mid-priced restaurant in Pittsburgh that serves GOOD brunch food! Ambience is fun and seating area is ample. Service is pleasant and atmosphere is casual. Proximity to Pitt and CMU keep it hopping and it can be a bit loud, but those factors are outweighed by the quality of the food. Eggs were a bit greasy, but otherwise delicious.

12\/1 UPDATE
We came here with both of our families over the weekend. Everything was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend the korean bbq poutine. It will blow your mind! I only have a few minor complaints. First, I felt that the food wasn't spicy enough especially considering that it was a Korean restaurant. Even the kimchi was surprisingly bland. Second, there were a few items we ordered that were supposed to come vegetarian but did not and thirdly, we ordered french fries for the kid only to find out that they didn't have ketchup. They shouldn't have french fries on the menu if they don't have ketchup.",1.0

- Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails, and the 
- Lamb Merguez Pogo Sticks

both of which were fantastic. 

The patio is pretty unsuspecting - and is a little secluded from the downtown scene, but makes for a nice place after work - as it is close to the office.",1.0
"Did they strategically place their shop in the same vicinity as a gym? if so, BRILLIANT!

Even if they were miles away from any type of calorie burning facility, I'd gladly visit this place to acquire their luscious sweets (and maybe a few extra lbs).

I've visited this place 4 times so far and have tried mini cheesecakes, dirt cups, tiramisu, monster cookies, macarons, blondies, and decorated sugar cookies. Nothing has been disappointing.

The décor just adds to the giddy feeling you get when you walk in. Your senses are dazzled by the smells, sights and tastes. The gals behind the counter are always friendly and patient. 

I have never tried their special occasion cakes but there are sample cakes that are shelved throughout their store, and they look absolutely beautiful.

"Allgemein
Nachdem in Echterdingen zwei Italienische Restaurants still und heimlich Ihre Preise erhöht haben, sind wir auf die Idee gekommen von Echterdingen nach Plieningen rüberzufahren. Dort waren wir im Da Mamma Maria , im Manga e Bevi und im Ristorante da Giuseppe. Am besten hat es uns im Da Giuseppe geschmeckt dass hier noch richtig italienisch gekocht wird wie es auf der Homepage heisst kann man nur bestätigen. Wir hatten einmal Kalbsfleisch mit Rosmarin Kartoffeln in einer super leckeren Soße ( ich weiss nicht mal was für eine Spezialsoße das war aber ich habe etwas Weisswein herausgeschmeckt mit etwas Zitrone) absolute Spitze! Das andere Gericht war ganz einfach und schlicht : Rigatoni mit Schinken und Erbsen in Sahnesoße dazu einfach frisches Brot und einen gemischten Salat. Den Salat habe ich noch etwas nachgewürtzt mit dem Olivenöl und dem Essig und Pfeffer , es war wirklich alles Tip Topp und dazu sehr schmackhaft. Ich will jetzt nicht über die anderen Restaurants in Plieningen herziehen denn dort hat es mir nicht so gut geschmeckt wie im Da Giuseppe , Für uns der absolute Geheimtipp in Plieningen , echtes italienisches Essen zum Top Preis. Wir hoffen nur dass dort auch nicht die Preise erhöht werden. Eine Terasse gibt es dort auch und innen ist es etwas klein dafür ist dort eine tolle Atmosphäre (klein aber fein). Vom Wein haben wir ehrlich gesagt keine Ahnung da wir Weinbanausen sind ( süß und fruchtig trinken wir gerne). Jesesmal wenn wir zu unserem neuen Stammitaliener gehen probieren wir etwas anderes aus. Bisher hat wirklich alles geschmeckt. Der Inhaber ist ein sehr herzlicher Mensch der zusammen mit seinen Söhnen das Lokal schmeisst. Wir haben unseren neuen Stammitaliener gefunden.

They have a huge range of options for breakfast, and almost everything is made there, not boxed or frozen, which is always a plus.  I had the Chicken Apple Compote Waffle, and the waffle and honey butter was amazing.  I'd probably go back to this place for the delicious looking, fluffy pankcakes or some homemade pie.",1.0
"Great Thai food! I have ever had an issue with the wait time - food always comes out within about 5 minutes. I like that they make it in front of you, and they have no problem with special requests. Staff is friendly, and the restaurant is always clean.",1.0
"I will, most-likely, be upping this to 5 stars. 

The only things I can say ""bad"" about the place, keeping in mind that it is a family-style diner, is I've driven past the place every day at least twice for 9 months or so and live within walking distance and would have never guessed it was there or what it is. I don't know whether to attribute that to my lack of observation skills (likely) or just bad signage\/placement of signage (just as likely).

 I am also not a fan of the hours and wish they were open at least for dinner. That being said, they seem to be family-owned and operated so that probably is the reason.

"The night we went they had Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Shania Twain and Elvis as the performers. Shania Twain was the best and was really into her character.

"We live in Las Vegas, and eat out a lot; a restaurant has to be really great for us to review it. But Argana knocked our socks off. 
 
The restaurant  has a beautiful interior: gold and red striped seats that look like pillow cushions, to make you think you're dining in a nomad's tent, and the light fixtures look like colorful glass lanterns (very pretty at night, when it's dark outside). And on Friday and Saturday nights they have a belly dancer, who encourages patrons to get up and dance with her.
 
My husband and I shared the following:
 
- a trio of mideastern salads (hummus, baba ghanoush and olive tapenade), with a generous basket of freshly made, pillowy soft pita, which the busboy kept refilling;
 
- an appetizer sized b'stilla (which they call ""pastilla""), which is ground chicken in a filo pastry shell, served  with an orange-and-greens salad;
 
- two beef skewers (they use FILET!), with a rice timbale, a couscous-stuffed tomato and a shredded white vegetable salad that was so good, it was our favorite thing there. (I swore it was shredded apple, but our waiter said it was white cabbage); and,
 
- boneless beef shortribs in a date and red wine reduction sauce, with tiny apricots and toasted almonds.
 
Let me stress, all the food we tried was SO GOOD. And all that, plus a glass of red wine for me, with tip, came to $70.00.
 
Everyone was so friendly. The waitstaff were incredibly attentive, the chef came by TWICE to talk to us, and the owner asked us how we liked our meal as we left.

"BEST RESTAURANT I'VE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE OF DINING AT! HANDS DOWN! 

The people at Mastros truly get it! Service service & more service. My wife & I ate here on our honeymoon & while he food was great, the service was amazing!!!

FOOD: My wife had the sea bass which was incredible. Buttery, delicate, flaky, delectable & flavorful. I had the incredible salmon & I was floored! Not to mention the huge complimentary warm butter cake was THE BEST RESTAURANT DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD! 

SERVICE: We ordered the mac-n-cheese but our waiter brought out the wrong side dish. He didn't dispute it, he didn't make a face or impose a funny energy about it AT ALL! He simply said, oh we're so sorry! Keep this one & I'll bring out the correct side dish. Whattttt?!?! Where do they do that at???? Mastro's apparently! They even plate your sides onto your entree plate for you. Ultimately & even more importantly the servers & bus boys energies were warm & full of laughter & smiles. This ..... Is what service is about as my wife & I rave about this place to everyone! This inspired a HUGE TIP! 

SYNOPSIS: You so called Michelin rated, 4 star uppity high end restaurants could learn a hell of a lot from Mastro's. They have single handed restored my faith that fine dining doesn't have to equate to stuffy, dry, bland, pretentious uninspired service & energy. 10 stars!",1.0

There are some things here you cannot get at other stores, they do have a decent selection of Organic items, but there are some things you just cannot find here.  

This particular location always seems to be crowded and being so close to Anthem, you do find the people there who feel they have earned a right to act any way they want based on their age and you should just get out of their way or leave the store until they are done shopping.

Sometimes I like to come here just for the challenge of trying to make my way through and see the reactions when they realize they are not the only person on the planet shopping at this store and the realization sets in, a great store with a great selection of items, some great prices was not built just for them, it was actually built for the rest of the community as well.",1.0
"I could probably eat here for the rest of my life! I've tried a lot of different things on the menu and they're all delicious.  My favorite is the greek salad wrap with chicken, it is perfectly tangy and delightful but the gyro is solid too.  My boyfriend always gets the falafel which he loves and sometimes if we're feeling wild we'll get dolmades and hummus.  I almost forgot about the feta fries!!!  Great Greek is really doing something right with those fries they're the best.  I believe its family owned and the woman behind the counter is always so sweet and welcoming.  It can get pretty busy though so we always order it over the phone and pick it up, otherwise there are about 8 tables or so inside- not bad but it can get packed",1.0

"There are few times in dining life when you instantly connect with a server. It has been that way for more than a year with Andrea at Tommy Bahama in Scottsdale.  Andrea has been providing us outstanding service that keeps us coming back an average of once a week since. Whenever possible we ask for her and you should do the same. Food is great, service even better, and we always feel like we've escaped to some tropical place. Relax and enjoy!",1.0

"L&L did a great job with my carpets and I will def be using them again and referring them to friends! They were very nice and professional both on the phone and in person.  Larissa confirmed my appointment as well as followed up with me afterwards to make sure I was satisfied with everything.  Lucas did a great job by arriving on time (and actually had to wait for me because I was late), got everything done in about an hour, and was very friendly the whole appointment regardless the fact that I made him wait.  I used a coupon as well and they honored it without trying to upcharge me anything.  Overall a great experience and looove my carpets again.",1.0
"As everyone else has mentioned, this place is a hidden gem. Have reservations about the shady shopping center? Put them aside! The food was amazing. I had the meat combo spicy fried rice (yes, i went to a Vietnamese restaurant and ordered fried rice, i wanted to try it) and it was amazingly tasty, addictive even. My wife had beef vermicelli, which she also loved and the small bite she let me have was quite tasty. Need your Asian fix but disappointed with Miyagi's in NoDa? Ya, me too, try Truc out.",1.0
Simply excellent.  Samir is an exquisite host and he goes above and beyond to ensure you enjoy your experience.  Lamb was excellent.  All the dishes had good flavor and were well presented.  This is a family owned restaurant that deserves your patronage.  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.,1.0
"Alright, driving down the strip wondering what's a good place to grab a small bite to eat, to my best ability as a yelper- it lead me here... this place wasnt hard to fine.. On corner of Oakley*  The restaurant is big and tons of space to sit.. Wasnt busy when I came through.  I order the woods-fire chicken arepas with cheese and avocado and a side of fried yucca root and pork.  First time trying arepas but it tasted like tomale due to the fact they used corn as the bread... And came with shredded chicken.   Overall I was satisfied with the arepas but Its a bit pricy for just this.. 4.99 for a small bite with no side.  The yucca root and pork was good but hey fried yucca root taste like fries with a bit texture difference, and the fried pork was flavorful.  This is a good place to stop by for a small bite :D some come try it out :D",1.0
Dumpling King is Amazing!! Very clean and great service and even better food!! This will be my new place for great Chinese food.,1.0
I really like this place..they have a great variety here and when it comes to rolls they do a great job here. One thing that stands out here is that the people that serve you here are really nice and they want their customers to try everything.normally when you go to an AYCE place they rush you and after about three orders they tend to forget about you because they don't want you to order anymore..lol I know maybe I'm paranoid or I eat alot of sushi. Oh the tempura ice cream is awesome and the island special roll is great.my wife loves that they have hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) which is bomb too.,1.0

Grassroots really has it going on! We had sharing deal called poke something! Loved it. BBQ brisket was fab. Shannon didn't refill my water but she got a great tip anyway.

"I don't usually venture out to Sauga for food (since the GTA area often has better Chinese food). But I happened to be in the area and tried this place out.

Overall pretty solid Chinese food! Got the $25 for three dishes, soup, and dessert. I especially liked the beef brisket & radish dish because the brisket was really lean (the way I like it). Price is reasonable compared to other Chinese places.",1.0
I came to train with Marcus Nash after seeing the results of my friends that go to him. After 1 month I've seen more changes in my body then I ever did working out on my own. He is so motivating and changes your workouts so you're never bored. Gym is super clean and never crowded. I love it so much I will never go anywhere else.,1.0
"Stumbled into Kanga unexpectedly and I was super excited as I have heard good things about this place. It was mid-afternoon and there were a wide variety of pie to choose from. Pie also came out fresh from the oven and it smelled amazing!
I opted for the Traditional Australian meat pie as one, I have never had one before so I thought why not keep it original and two, it was fresh out of the oven!
I got this 'to go' and it was still really good after an hour before I got home. The pie crust was perfect- buttery and flakey. The filling was tasty with the right amount of meat filling.

I will definitely be trying the other pies when I get a chance. Also they have these wireless chargers if you happen to have no juice in your phone and want to enjoy some pie!",1.0
"Really good.   Went several times before reviewing so we could try different things.  Dominic is the man.  The girls who are servers\/cashiers are also very friendly.  Have tried pizza, pasta, sandwiches and have yet to be disappointed.  BOYB here which is fine.   A little pricey, but compared to the garbage to pick from in this area it is worth it, for now.",1.0

"I am generally a fan of Fry's based upon comparison shopping for the things I buy.  This review is specific to those things that make this story different.

First, it's layout is more intuitive than most - things just seem to appear where you would expect them.  Shelves are almost always well-stocked, checkout is fast, and there are a lot of useful non-food items.

Negatives are a lack of a large ethnic and Kosher areas, and a disturbuing willingness of the produce department to leave substandard fruits and vegetables on the shelves -- I don't want to have to inspect every green bean.  When produce nears the end of its life, it should be discarded, not reduced in price, or worse yet packaged so that its less agreeable parts are hidden.",1.0
"I'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and I had both our wedding ceremony and reception at Mix.  On one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a Saturday evening in Vegas for a seven hour event.  

So, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  Edit: looks like I have to trim my review, I hit the 5000 character limit. :-(

1) Ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate Mix.  There is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  The interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.

The main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  If you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  If you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  I recommend after dark for balcony seating.

2) Service - I've never had a bad experience at Mix.  My wife and I visited Vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at Mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  We did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  Drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.

We've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  I'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.

3) Special requests.  They've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding\/reception and since then.  For example, on our first anniversary when we went back, I arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to Mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  The restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  If you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.

4) FOOD!  Okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  Here's what we've had and when:

a) The pepper crusted bison tenderloin, cod brandade and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  The bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  On the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.

b) Surf & turf.  Although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  My wife gets this religiously and loves it.  I will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from N9NE at the Palms.  There's regular surf & turf, then there's Mix's surf & turf, then there's the N9NE surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.

c) Filet mignon rossini with foie gras & black truffle sauce.  If you're into truffles, I'm sure you'll love this.  The steak comes out perfectly.  I'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love\/hate meals for me.  Perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.

d) Roasted maine lobster ""au curry"".  I love spicy, I love Indian food, I love this meal.  It's my go-to Mix meal; I get it every time once I tried it.  It's perfect combo of everything I love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.

Don't forget to go visit the Mix Lounge next door after dinner!  Great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).",1.0
"Super fun place! I love playing games and it makes it easy to meet new people and break the ice inviting them to play Cards Against Humanity with you. The video games also bring back fun memories and the possibility of making new ones. Their beer selection is huge! And the place has it's originality from the name, to the tables, even the glasses for the beers on tap sets them apart. Love it!",1.0
I recently needed a repair on my A\/C.  He gave me a reasonable estimate and did a thorough check to make sure everything was okay.  Great friendly service.  I was also having the house painted at the time.  He also called later to make sure I turned off the A\/C before the painters started spraying the house.,1.0
"The best cupcakes I have ever tasted. Cupcakes are super moist and flavorful and a reasonable serving size. My sister-in-law and I have made a hobby of exploring cupcake shops together and these beat out Sweet Maggie's in amherst and La Bella of Lakewood. 

IMO, the flavor combos and icing put these over the top. I had chocolate raspberry and raspberry champage. The icing is not sugary sweet and crunchy like other shops but creamy with just enough substance that it doesn't make the cupcake soggy.",1.0
I love Picazzo's!!! If you are gluten sensitive or not this is the best restaurant- give it a try you won't be disappointed.,1.0
"The good egg is a great breakfast place.  I appreciate their extensive menu AND the calorie count listed next to every item (including add-ons). In this day and age I can get on board with a place that can give diners the truth about caloric intake of what they are choosing. That being said, what you eat is a choice, and there is a LOT to choose from here.  If you like traditional (and some not so traditional) breakfast food, that is cooked well, you will like The Good Egg.  Added bonus, you get an entire pot of coffee for your table when you initially order coffee, makes refills a breeze.",1.0
"Very good food! Love the taste with the cheese wiz..Yeh, I'm easy to please having grown up on cheese wiz. Had the large cheesesteak work meat and cheese only. Tasted great to me...won't know till I go to Philly how close to the real deal it is. Had the cheese fries too! Satisfied customer! Only knock is the price for the large...I could of ate 2 of them effortlessly...but after getting cheese fries and a drink, almost $14 just for me. Great food though...now to my wife's leftovers!",1.0
"The food is good, the sushi is fresh, and the udon is hot. Also, I've always found the service friendly though when they get busy it slows down a bit to accommodate the influx. For people who like a sushi restaurant that's polished and modern, may not be for you. For those of us who don't care about the trend factor and dig the Japanese diner feel, well, more yummy food for us!",1.0
"The deli meats here are totally legit. The reuben, with its delicious beef, toasted bread, and accompanying kraut make a great and extremely filling combination. Their pastrami was great too, which I tried with the rye sandwich. For the latter, I actually got their special Stan-wich, which also came with corned beef in addition to pastrami. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of their famous meats. I would probably mention that the rye bread was a bit hard, especially around the crust, so I'd stick with just the reuben or rachel.",1.0
Had a great experience having my van serviced there. Scotty Wendell was very thorough in diagnosing issues with my vehicle and helping me to decide what repairs were necessary right now. My van is running better than it has since we bought it.,1.0
"Came to Bento Box Fresh Wasabi for lunch and the place was very clean and well appointed. The bento box specials are what attracted us to try the place, and they more then lived up to our expectations. We were pleasantly surprised to find our salmon teriyaki bento came with a full piece of salmon, and one of the better pieces of fish I have had. We also had two rolls which were also part of a lunch special - shrimp tempura and tootsie roll. I couldn't try any of the sushi since I am currently prego, but the rolls were great. For a little neighborhood spot, it is great and we will definitely be back for a lunch or casual night out. Great bang for the buck and good food.",1.0
"Went for the first time last October Halloween weekend. Steve Angello was the DJ that night. He KILLED IT! Apparently they have guest DJs here all the time. 

It's your typical Vegas club you wait FOREVER in line unless you pay the bouncer $20  then you can skip the line then pay the $20-40 cover charge.

The club itself is pretty big. Nice dance floor and the people there are beautiful. Of course the drinks are stupid expensive ($12 for a mixed drink) But that's why I brought my flask in I'm not spending that much for a drink lol 

Tryst which is next door at the wynn is usually my go to club but I think I found my new favorite spot. 

If you're a Vegas first timer get there early or try to go during the day and get on the guest list so you can skip the line.",1.0

"I love this place! I go to the Ahwatukee center and it's only a couple of blocks from home. I was turned onto it by a friend at the Women's Networking event. I was a little hesitant, but liked the concept, so I signed up for an introductory plan. I was amazed at how clean, friendly and easy to do the whole thing was. I have been going for 2 months now. I usually buy 14 meals for 3 people. There is just my husband and I. Then because I like to cook myself, I fill in the other meals at home. It is a real timesaver. Who knew you could get food this good, that cooks this fast? Thanks Dream Dinners!",1.0

"This is my 100th review since 2008.

During the past three years, I ordered two kitchen butcher blocks from this company. The quality of the blocks is superb. The prices were very reasonable, and most importantly they have a great customer service staff. 

I take care of these blocks as the instructions state and three years later, they are still in tip-top condition. I feel that investing in good kitchen butcher blocks was a great decision for me.

I strongly recommend the Butcher Block Company and award them 5 stars",1.0
"This place was simply delicious. Although the decor and ambiance is not necessarily what I'm used to for an Indian restaraunt, the food blew me away. I got the chicken Koorma and it was the perfect balance between sweet, spicy, and savory and the chicken was cooked perfectly. Service was great. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the seating. The tables are a little close together so it was kinda hard to have an intimate feel. Other than that this place is awesome.",1.0
"Dr.Parson just did my revisional breast surgery a month ago . I had 24 year old silicone implants in front of the muscle. After a fall hiking, ruptured one and a mammogram emptied it all out. I was a mess! You would never know, with how incredible I look!!! ( Now I'm behind muscle, ) A friend highly recommended Dr. Parson to me... And i would HIGHLY recommend him to anyone looking for an awesome surgeon! I LOVE my results! He exceeded my expectations! He is amazing! Meet him, you'll be thankful you found him too! He is genuine, caring, listens, and is very compassionate. He has an honest and nurturing demenor. I know I was  in the best hands possible! The staff is warm , welcoming  and kind. You'll  be well taken care of throughout the entire process ...pre-and post-surgery. I LOVE my results!!! I will continue to sing his praises and this level of care is incomparable . The best.
Thank you Dr.Parson, (Danielle, and Amy,too!).... For everything!!!!!

"A great culinary adventure for all the foodies out there! Everything we had was really interesting and memorable. If I had to pick, the cotton candy foie, the ham and bean soup, and the iberico bun were my favorites. Even though 20 dishes seem daunting, it's really bite-sized portions and we were full but not stuffed at the end (which was great!!). 

I think part of the experience also depends on the other diners. The chef was very focused and the other diners were friendly but not too chatty, so it was a quiet meal. It would be nice to come with a group of friends so you can enjoy the experience.

Would I come back again, especially given the $$$? Probably not anytime soon. I think this is a great choice for a really special occasion but I'll save my everyday $ for his other casual restaurants.",1.0
"This place is solid and unforgettable. 

My fave dishes here are the (very unique) vermicili(esp. the one with spring rolls and fried tofu or sprimp)... It's ingredients are multifaceted, and the sweet and sour sauce on top is the only sweet and sour sauce I've ever enjoyed. The pho with brisket is yummy, but I'd like to try the pho at Pho So(which somehow looks better) to compare.

Drunken noodles here are great(any or all meats); so are the potstickers.

I dislike: the spring rolls(they always taste old and bland); the Thai tea here sucks, so get a... Vietnamese coffee instead. Or an avocado smoothie!

Call to make a reservation for a group dinner, or your legs will regret it. Prices are reasonable--some dishes are maybe $2ish overpriced in comparison to nyc\/sf spots... But who cares when you're a block from the Strip.",1.0
"This was my first time at potbelly,and I loved it!! The ordering system kind of reminds me of Quiznos, but the sandwiches are way better.

I definitely will be back!",1.0
"My 2nd experience at Sujeo was much better than my first. Having gone with a large group I got to sample many dishes!

Appetizers
Kohlrabi salad- very refreshing! I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. 

Thai egg salad- looks a lot like the kohlrabi salad but with egg. Tasty as well! 

Sichaun beef tongue salad- I enjoyed this much more than last time, the seasoning was not as overpowering and salty. 

Chili braised eggplant- a lot of people enjoyed this but I thought it was just ok. I thought the eggplant could have been cooked just a tad more.

Ddeobokki- enjoyed this, tasted pretty authentic!

Entrees
General Tso chicken livers- a huge portion. Good for 2 people. But I thought the dish tasted a little heavy, the sauce was the thick and sugary and I could only handle maybe 3 or so pieces. Ok but not my fav dish.

Grilled Thai sausage- interesting flavor but was way too dry.

Hot pot- for 25 or so dollars this is a pretty good deal. The broth was great and veggies were tasty. Seemed a little stingy on the meat considering how much you are paying. I enjoyed this more than the Ssam I had last time...but the Ssam always changes. 


All in all I enjoyed the apps way more than the entrees

The homemade custard was still delicious. Definitely get it! They had two flavors and said they could swirl them but I asked if they could do one on top of the other and they kindly obliged! The rhubarb was tart but not overly so. Peanut butter was good but I would not be able to eat a whole cone of it because it's a little heavier.",1.0
Good response time after calling the morning of service. Only checked one company based on reviews. A little pricey but good service. Replaced both overhead springs on garage and one sensor (broke my wall plate cover). Would recommend for services if needed done in a timely manner.,1.0

"I came here because one of my coworkers told me it was ""the best food he's ever had in Toronto"". I would say it's *the* best, but it's definitely up there.

Before I mention what I ordered, I really have to hand it to the service. Our waiter seemed to always know exactly what was going on at our table, offered a lot of advice\/recommendations while we were ordering stuff, and overall, just did a great job of making sure we had a great dining experience.


We accidentally ordered the lamb leg instead of the lamb ribs, but it was worth it. The lamb was ridiculously tender, and it reminded me of the bo ssäm at Momofuku. It was a little too much for two people to finish though, we had to pack it up afterwards.

We also had the roasted red beets, seared cauliflower, and duck kibbeh - everything was really good. I'll definitely go back some time to taste the rest of the menu.",1.0
"Visited here for the 2nd time. Very large park with an extensive variety of plants from all over the world. Many areas to explore. There are plenty of spots to stop and sit on benches and chairs. Since it is still late spring, many plants were not in bloom yet. However, we managed spending 3 hours here and enjoyed our visit. Highly recommended.",1.0
"Checked this spot out with my girlfriend tonight after having a bad experience at another restaurant and I must say, we were very impressed.

The food was excellent and the service was great! As others have mentioned though, this place gets loud. So loud it can be hard to hear someone sitting directly across from you. To the owner, I would recommend a better sound system because while this one is loud, it didn't seem to be spread out well.

All in all, we had a great experience and will be back. Minus 1 star because the ambiance of 30 people shouting over Jay Z and Kanye West for 45 minutes kind of gives you a headache.",1.0
"Ate here Friday and Saturday, everything was tasty except the sushi.  The service was friendly, fast water refills, fast plate removals, but the asian cashier was mean and unwelcoming.  The watermelon siracha was innovative, the goat cheese w lavender amazing, and the sphagetti Nero w langoustine out of this world!  Small portions and getting up to get my own food was good for my waistline, thank you wicked spoon for keeping me fit while pigging out!",1.0
"Best buffet in Vegas. Hands down. Even better (or at least on par) with that at the Wynn. Great cheese selection, succulent prime rib, variety of Asian dishes, Mexican dishes, and OMG the desserts are executed perfectly.

Most buffets in Vegas I compare to high school food cafeterias nowadays, unfortunately. When in their prime, they were all to die for. Now only Bacchanal and Wynn's buffet hearken back to those good old days. 

High quality food, done right. Line can be pretty long, so plan accordingly.",1.0
"Called them Monday evening and they said that they could come out Tuesday to give an estimate. Juan came out, he is also the owner. He is EXTREMELY nice, soft spoken, not pushy like so many people here in town. I called him later that evening after having another company out for an estimate. Juan was just barely cheaper than the others, but definitely reasonable. Now it is Thursday, the glass was installed by Juan and I would definitely use him again AND I would recommend him to anyone else that needs a glass replaced. Mine was a cracked window so wasn't so much an emergency. But if you want a great company with great people, this is the company for you.",1.0
Very clean traditional Arabic grocery store. The variety is unbelievable. Anything middle eastern food u can think of they have it. They also have an awesome in-house pita bread machine factory in the store. Their desserts r amazing. Their cheese selection is nice to see. And their meat selection are competitive. They also have a mini resto\/bistro where u can eat hot made food. I enjoy the experience everytime i come here. Not ur typical grocery store. U should come n try this at least once no matter what ur background is,1.0
Excellent!  We had the french toast and a ham\/swiss\/fried egg crepe which were very good.  The best part for us was that the staff provided a box of toys for our two kids to play with.  Very attentive staff and great food.,1.0

"First off, with some of these negative reviews, I have only one thing to say......YOU DID NOT GO TO DESIREE!!!!!! She is unbelievably amazing! I always, always, always, leave her studio feeling so fabulous! She is such a talented hairdresser & definitely knows what she's doing. I believe she even teaches a class there. Anyways, I have never seen anyone get a bad haircut from her. She is truly an artist! & she loves doing my haircuts since I sort of let her experiment how she chooses with mine :)
 
One thing, however, I would rather have given this place 4.5 stars ONLY because this place is a little bit pricey. But remember, you get what you pay for, & she does a great job of having me feel satisfied with my money spent!

BOOK WITH DESIREE B.!!!!! I promise she won't disappoint!",1.0
"So far so good!! I was initially working with Ricky and Nikki to do all the pricing and they were great since they worked with my budget and were very informational when they met with us online. But it wasn't until we worked with John that we were truly impressed! John was so professional on our wedding day (March 22). Him and his assistant (Lily?) were like ninjas. I didn't even notice them until i was actually trying to find them. I will review again after we see the video, but so far we are EXTREMELY happy with our choice. I can't wait to see the final product!!!",1.0
"Exceptional! Husband and I had a date night to the soft opening! It was perfection. The smoked bacon appetizer was to die for- and the steaks came hot and perfectly cooked. Our server was personable and knowledgable. I would--and I have-- recommend this place to ""dine"" with your sweetheart.",1.0
"This is THE place to go for elaborate, blingy nails!!! I went there for the first time last week and was blown away! Jeni is the lady to ask for, she's incredible and friendly.

I love this office. The staff is very professional and the Doctor listens. I do want to give a personal shout out to Martina the assistant. She is wonderful at what she does. X-rays with her are painless. I highly recommend this Dentist to everyone in the Las Vegas area.,1.0
"Wow I have so much fun going here! It reminds me of Wegman's on the east coast. I love the fresh foods section and meals to go. I am also impressed with their healthy food selection. I needed coconut milk yogurt and Fry's has it for cheaper than anywhere else I can buy it from. Win! They have a frozen yogurt spot that I want to try too.  Like, the swirly kind out of a machine. Also, a co-worker once bought my birthday cake from here and I loved it so much and haaad to know where he got it from - I thought it was a professional bakery!",1.0

"Looking for a high quality, quick, sandwich, potato salad, lunch?  This is the place!  My favorite is the ham ole (it's a special menu).  Every sandwich I have had has been great!  The meat and ingredients they use are high quality and full of fresh flavor.  Two thumbs up!",1.0
So many things here that I love to eat it's hard to start somewhere. The scallops and crispy duck salad to start is amazing. No seriously the crispy duck salad is life changing. Then for your main course the fried rice is a must and I recommend the Mongolian beef to go with it. The restaurant it self has an amazing atmosphere with a cool vibe. It's one of my go to spots to eat when taking my girl out.,1.0
"I walked in and the owner cut two bike stands and installed them on a kids bike, put pedals on a kids bike and did a few needed maintenance adjustments. Most places don't have anything for kids bikes but I even bought the rubber handle bar covers for the ends. My dog chews everything up.",1.0
"We went to Rock Lobster for the first time last night and were very impressed with the entire experience. From the moment we walked in we had someone attentive to us and explaining the menu, drink options and a quick history of the place, then had a friendly server who gave recommendations on the menu and made sure to check in. I had the lobster roll and it was to die for; better than what I've had out East. The chowder was good but I've tried better and would try something new next time. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat from quality staff to quality food.",1.0
"Great company. Reasonably priced. They showed up a little late because of car troubles but called to say so...hey, it happens. Very professional and fast. Ran out of room in the truck I rented, didn't know I had that much s**t, so they put the last item, our tv, in their own vehicle. Went above and beyond...would definitely recommend them.",1.0
"I WISH I KNEW ABOUT THE FREQUENT DRINKER PROGRAM before I began a 3 week daily coffee binge.

Okay, now that I have that off my chest -I consistently find the drinks at Beanz to be satisfactory and flavorful. It is not the most complex coffee I've had, however I don't go there for that! I go there for the sweet liquid morsels that satisfy my need for:

1. Sugar
2. Caffeine
3. Hot sugar\/caffeine\/liquid delivery vehicle

I am curious however why a ""Latte"" (lah-tay) is pronounced as such at Beanz, and a ""Frappe"" is pronounced (Frahppps)...?!

"I was here on Monday for dinner and it was amazing! I got the gluten free halibut and the batter was perfect--crispy, just a tad greasy, with an amazing flavour. 

I also appreciated their dedicated gluten-free fryer, and their half onion ring\/half chip side dish. Brilliant. I'll be back this weekend for more.",1.0
Stopped in on a weeknight for a gel mani and was seriously impressed. Cash only but my mani has lasted awhile without chips it was definitely worth it!,1.0
"Solid four star dessert place! However, do not make the mistakes I did!

I went here because I like Rita's iron the east coast, and they're basically the exact same place. I got gelati's at Rita's which is basically Italian ice sandwiched by what they call ""custard"" which is basically a very rich delicious soft serve. 

When going to CJs, I was hoping for the same delicious custard, and man did they deliver! However, I got a gelati, and the Italian ice was good but not great. 

My girlfriend did the right thing... She got what they call a ""concrete"" which is just custard and you can mix things in, basically an upgraded McFlurry! She got vanilla with caramel and Oreo pieces mixed in... And it was to die for!

Also they have pints in the refrigerator with UNBELIEVABLE flavors! At between like 6-8 dollars for the pint (or was it quart?), it actually would have made more sense for us to get the unbelievable flavored custards and just split it. That's what we will do in the future :)",1.0
"This place knows what they are doing! Great food, great service and great prices. The salsa bar has tons of options, the atmosphere is fun and bright, and the patio is the perfect place to sit and enjoy your food! I highly recommend.",1.0
"I've been here twice and must say that their rice and beans remind me of a New York style Dominican restaurant.  This is a very good thing if you're originally from NY and have been looking for good Dominican food.

Service is ok, but let's all be real in why we go to Dominican restaurants; rice, beans, pollo guisado, Rabo guisado, and the like. I read a review where someone's feelings were hurt (a Dominican client) but they don't really explain how their poor review ties into how the food taste.  My 4 star review is bumped to 5 to help offset their bias.  Saona's strength is their beans - they're awesome.  I wasn't happy with the breaded version of their chicharrón de pollo but maybe their boned version is not breaded and just seasoned which I prefer.  Everything else I had (Rabo\/pollo guisado) was really good too.  Server was friendly both times.",1.0
great frozen yogurt... wide variety of flavored and they always change... the employees working are always.. and I mean always friendly... a home town place... love it,1.0
Dim Sum have so many variety and taste is so yummy.  They are have the traditional style Dim Sum Cart to sell the dim sum.  Worth to take a try and you will like it a lot!!,1.0
"Babytown has nicer cribs and nursery bedding then Buy Buy Baby in my opinion.  The overall quality of the nursery furniture is superior.  The nursery bedding selection is nicer overall and cuter!

Otherwise the selection is pretty similar to Buy Buy Baby in Chandler.  This store is locally owned and operated though so you should definitely shop here if possible.

I hear from my girlfriends that they take Buy Buy Baby coupons and Bed Bath and Beyond coupons too like their competitors.  I haven't tried this myself though, but will soon!  

The staff is pretty aloof.  That is fine for me though as I like to browse by myself and do my research online.

There is a huge parking lot too which makes parking pretty easy.  It is also located a couple doors down from a Super Target, which is very convenient.",1.0
"Great authentic Italian lunch time restaurant. You need reservations. Always busy. Daily specials. Staff are friendly and food is served hot, fast and delicious. I ordered the Gnocchi in wild boar tomato sauce emmmm!  My friend had the special Gnocchi in a cream and wild mushroom sauce with peas and shaved Parmesan. Oh very decadent. My waist expanded a few inches over that meal. The gnocchi was as good as mine, and that's saying a lot. Lol!!! Portions were generous. 
Too bad they don't open for dinner, but are available for special occasions. A little pricy for lunch, but was well worth every bite. Definitely going back.",1.0

"This review is just for the lounge... 
Ladies called and we going out for dranks! Came for a comp bottle and the views are gorgeous from the top! There is outdoor seating however we were seated inside. There were about nine of us so it was a tight squeeze for the table we were at.. Ended up just taking stools from the table next to us. 
It wasn't very busy either but it was great. Loved it!

Update: I did come for HH one evening with a couple of coworkers. We were seated outside a d enjoyed the great views and sampled various foods off their HH menu. Everything was really good especially the Shrimp Cocktail thingy! I highly recommend it!!",1.0
I checked YELP today to find a company to come over and spray our house. I saw that Insectek was a local company that had really good reviews. I set up an appointment and the Tech (Gerrit) was on time and courteous. He was very through and knowledgeable. I was extremely happy with the service as he was in and out in a timely manner. Really glad I went with them and going to use in the future. Highly recommend!,1.0
I had the misfortune of having a bike thief using his bike lock to lock my road bike down to a bike post. And i did not have the tools to yank it open. And Jeff came by and get it out for me. He is such a friendly guy. Gave me a good price too. Thank you Jeff.,1.0
"Recently had lunch here with my small work crew (3 of us) to celebrate the Holidays. The restaurant was completely dead mid-week so at first I thought maybe we'd made a terrible mistake. My fears were quickly assuaged as our food started arriving. We ordered the lobster sliders as an appetizer to share between two of us, and our other colleague had the lobster bisque. The lobster sliders? Well they are the things dreams are made of, I'm still salivating over them weeks later. Lobster bisque was also apparently outstanding. Fries with old bay, perfectly cooked and tasty. For our entrees, two of us each had the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the other had the steak salad. The steak sandwich and truffle fries were absolutely delicious and I hear the salad was really fantastic. Service was impeccable and obviously we had the restaurant to ourselves, so our every need was catered to perfectly. I definitely will be back.",1.0
"Luke's has been around as long as I can remember- at least since my first visit in the early 1990's. The food is consistent superb.

"What a great place! Convenience store\/ ice cream stop. I've been going here ever since I was a little kid. Great wide range of ice cream flavors and they're all good!

The mini gold is also a ton of fun as well as the new tube slopes they have for winter and summer(odd  for location, but convenient fun)",1.0

"I think I'm due for an update. I've been here many, many times in the past year and service has always been great. Ambiance has definitely improved. They added music! Yay! Regular menu items seem a bit pricey so catch them on their Happy Hour, Everyday 2-6 PM. BOGO 50% off Smoothies (Boba Add'l), Waffle Sandwich & Kettle Chips for $5 and Milk or Thai Tea (Buy 2 Get One Free).

Everything is worth trying. I've had Chicken & Waffles, Waffles with Strawberry & Banana with Chocolate Sauce, Ham and Pineapple Waffle Pizza, Green Tea and Banana Smoothies, Oreo Shakes, Tornado Fries, etc. They were all delicious!  Their waffles are so crunchy and fluffy at the same time. I'm so used to being served soggy waffles so it's a treat coming here.

I've seen reviews critiquing them serving on paper plates and such. I don't find it tacky or anything. There's nothing wrong with that, in my opinion. It doesn't take away from the food being yummy. Just a thought.",1.0

"So many different flavors of gelato! It was so fun to try them all. And there was such a variety as well! I liked the ambiance of the place - it felt a bit like Italy.

My milkshake was a bit milky and lost the flavor of the gelato. But I would still return and maybe just choose a stronger flavor or ask for less milk. Otherwise, it was great!!",1.0
"This place makes the best octopus I've ever had by a mile.  It was perfectly cooked, super moist and seasoned perfectly.  We also had fried zucchini patties which, again, were probably the best I've ever had.  The fish is incredibly fresh and they allow you to choose which one you like.  My only complaint is how disorganized they were and our waitress had a bit of attitude.  For some reason they cooked my friends steak too early and had it tented for way too long.  By the time he got it a medium rare was well done.

Food wise it's some of the freshest, tastiest, and most authentic mezes on the Danforth, if they can work out those kinks it would be perfect.",1.0
"Best sushi I've had! So many different items to choose from. There's a lot of items on the menu that other sushi places charge more, but here, it's all included in all you can eat. The flavor and spices they use are amazing. I recommend this place to any friends that come from out of town.",1.0
"I had never had sushi before.  I have always been afraid to try it.  So, I went here with some friends.  My friend ordered all kinds of sushi for me to try.  My other friend eats Vegan so she ordered some vegan rolls.  All I can say is that I could not stop eating the rolls we had.  Obviously I know nothing about sushi but I can't stop thinking about this place and I can't wait to go back.  We were there a little late and it's got a great little vibe.

"Allgemein
Lage -  das Restaurant befindet sich wenn man vom Rathaus in Stuttgart-Vaihingen Richtung Uni fährt 2. Strasse rechts abbiegt gleich auf der linken Seite. Bitte nicht mit dem Pizza-Express Harmonie verwechseln.
Am Haus den rechten Eingang nehmen !
Parkplatz - Gibt es begrenzt an der Strasse.
Publikum - Gemischtes Publikum (sehr familienfreundlich).
Gute Italienische Küche - eigentlich ein Geheimtipp !
Das Lokal ist zu empfehlen !
Bedienung
Uns war es nach Italienisch. Im Lokal war es komplett voll und wir durften an der Theke bei dem wir uns sehr nett mit dem Mitpächter unterhielten, warten bis ein Tisch frei wurde. Der Service war sehr freundlich und total authentisch, also ein Original.
Da wir nicht wussten was wir essen wollten, fagten wir den Service was er Heute empfehlen könnte.

Das Essen
Also es begann mit Bruschetta in 3 Varianten - mit Tomaten, einer frischen Creme und Olivenpaste. War echt lecker und das Brot warm und cross.
Als Nächstes, in Nudelteig gerollter Spinat in Tomatensoße - total lecker ! Gegrillte Baby-Calamaris auf Rucola - Interessante Kombi und auch sehr lecker. Warmer Chicoree mit dunklen fein geschnittenen Oliven - habe ich so noch nie gegessen - Klasse !
Es ging weiter, rechteckige Pizza mit Lachs direkt auf Stein gebacken - der Teig und die Zutaten
waren Top ! Das Essen war wirklich sehr lecker !
Beim Wein wollte ich keinen Pino Grigio und fragte was könnte er empfehlen ? Ich war überrascht und hatte in dem Lokal nicht damit gerechnet, dass hier ein Roero Arneis DOCG aus Piemont ausgeschenkt wird - war nicht auf der Karte.
Das Ambiente
Einfach und gemütlich und es wird in Richtung Toiletten gerade renoviert.
Sauberkeit
Das Lokal innen und auch die Toiletten vermittelten einen gut gepflegten Eindruck.",1.0
"When does one visit Dairy Queen and leave in a bad mood? For me, that would be a very difficult task. The staff was sweet, but honestly, how can you hate someone who hands you a Blizzard? Fat chance! Haha.

I grew up eating DQ and their Dipped Cones, so this is no new frontier to me. However, I stopped getting their for a long time because the location closest to me shut down. When a friend showed me this location, I fell in love with Dairy Queen all over again.

My brother and sister and I recently visited this location for a Valentine's lunch date and we were more than satisfied. The day was beautiful, so we chose a table outside on the patio. 

Currently, DQ is offering a $5 lunch special that includes your choice of a burger, chicken tenders, or a hot dog, as well as fries, a drink, and a sundae (can be upgraded to a small Blizzard for $1). My sister and I ordered chicken tenders  and my brother got a burger. My sister and I were hesitant that the portion would be too small, but it was just right. This is a great deal!

We all upgraded to Blizzards and all also ordered the same flavor: French Silk Pie. This was my second time getting this Blizzard and it was just as wonderful as the first time. This Blizzard comes with cookie pieces, melt in your mouth shards of milk chocolate, and a billowy topping of whipped cream on top. So delicious. Get it!

This most recent visit to DQ was perfect, I can't wait to come back again!

"Never been to the original place. Too far. I like this one though! It's at the Mediterranean Market plaza on Spring Mountain. Watch for the Red Rock street sign if you're approaching from the Strip.

So anyway, I walked in at maybe 10:45 and didn't see any other customers. The front-of-the-house guy (sounds better than server, right?) invited me to the register to read a menu there and to tell me all about the place, after figuring out that it was my first time. I kinda zoned out, but doesn't everybody know by now that it's pretty much Korean fusion hot dogs plus some sort of new breakfast items to differentiate it? The guy actually confessed that they hadn't held their grand opening event yet and were still working out some kinks in the menu, but I'm sure they'll be fine if they stick to their bread and butter, so to speak.

I settled on the bulgogi hot dog ($6.95). It's a nice footlong sausage topped with beef, bulgogi mayo, green onions, grilled onions, and sesame seeds on a fairly nondescript but satisfactory bun. There aren't a ton of layers of flavor, but the flavors that are there really shone for me. Loved the texture and thickness of the beef for sure, and the mayo works very well. The depth that is possibly missing includes sweetness, spiciness (although I deliberately avoided testing my palate for this go-around), and maybe egginess. +$1.50 for a fried egg next time maybe? By the way, the portion size is very lunch-appropriate.

Now that I can get the fusion goodness without driving all the way out to who knows where, I think I'll definitely return. You should visit Buldogis Cafe as well.",1.0

I got the bulgogi bento box and my fiancé got the chicken teriyaki. Both were fantastic and under 10$. The meat was flavourful and well cooked, and the rolls were very fresh tasting, quite a departure from what you'd expect at an AYCE place. The box also comes with dumplings, rice, salad, and miso soup. Everything tasted great and we both left feeling satisfied but not stuffed. Will be going back!",1.0

"We knew we were going to get in late on a Thursday night, so we decided just to book one night here for $21 on Groupon. 

We were actually pleasantly surprised by the casino floor. They had plenty of slots, a late night snack food restaurant and a lounge. It kept us entertained for a few late night hours after we got in, which was awesome since it is located off the strip and we were too lazy to drive anywhere.

The rooms on the other hand were just OK. I think my only complaint would be the shower leaking the entire time we were there. I was so grossed out by the towel inside the shower used to soak up the water that was dripping that I even avoided showering until we checked in to our other hotel. Other than that...the beds were comfy, there was plenty of room and it was quiet.

"I love finding places that give value!

L'Usine de Saghetti's got the right mix, so here are your 1, 2, 3s

Atmosphere: Warm! The entire place is draped in wood - floors, walls, tables, chairs... it feels like they've carved out the place from inside of a massive tree.  Small(isn) yet disruptively well spaced L'Usine is a great place to be on an intimate date or with a group of friends.

Food: This is where the place comes up trumps - a great selection of freshly made pastas served with a basket of fresh bread and an open bar salad.  What's nice is that of the dishes I tried none where over-bearing or overly heavy, which leaves you with the opportunity to really savour the meal at hand.  Le Golden Square mile was my favourite choice - extremely well done.   Last, L'Usine has a great selection of wines - some of which are 'importation privée (ip) i.e. they have been exclusively procured for the L'Usine.  Points!  Prices range from $14-$18 per dish, and little more for the fancier varieties (with meats an such) - like I said, value!

Service: the service here is good - nothing overly fancy, in fact the waitresses are quite casual about their work.  Not to say that they are slack or uninterested, but they are efficient and hardly noticeable otherwise.  Bring some of your A French game when you come - some waitress' communicate best in French here. mais ce n'est pas un problème - juste une autre occasion de pracitice la langue de Molière!

I just had a delicious shawarma wrap at Sammy's. There aren't that many great options around U of T but this is definitely one of the better ones ... And best yet it has wifi if you use your UTORID.

Great mechanic. You definitely won't overpay for your service. These guys are honest and don't try to rack up the bill for things you don't need. My transmission went out in my car and they fixed it with no problems. Communication could have been a little better but it's only because they're always so busy.,1.0
"I decided to try this place despite the bad reviews and I actually had a great experience. I did not make an appointment I walked in. They do offer debit and ask to pay prior to services. Which I was okay with since after getting nails done it is usually difficult to get cards out of your purse anyways. 

I got a Mani and pedi for a good price $40. I only waited maybe 10minutes and was greeted by a very friendly girl named vicky. I thought she did a great job and was very personable. 

Overall. I went there nervous due to bad reviews but I actually have no complaints. I would go back again definitely. I would ask for vicky again though since I am now comfortable with her service.",1.0
"I have lived in the 909 West apts for 1 yr, 10 months. I picked this apt for the 2 bdrm floor plan and have been very happy with it. The grounds are kept nice and the bldgs were painted just last year. The only reason we are moving is my husband got transferred back to CA where we came from. We have covered parking and a garage. I will miss this place. I have been happy with the staff and when I need assistance I can be sure that office staff or maintenance will be there to help. The staff has always been friendly and willing to listen and take care of any questions or problems that may arise. Yes, sometimes it has been a bother like when they had to move us to another apt during the fire sprinkler re-pipe but we were taken care of. Sometimes neighbors on the second or third floors forget that someone lives under them and stomp on the floor or pound on something or slam doors and the tenant below them can hear it. But for the most part it is a quiet and relaxing place to live. My apt is in the back of the complex and we use the back gate. We might hear the occasional siren from the street but the only time I have seen that there was any problem inside the complex was the day a motorhome caught fire in the parking lot. Sad that happened. It is a safe place to live and I am comfortable walking around after dark inside the complex. It is a ""crime free"" neighborhood and there is a security officer that walks around at night.",1.0

"If you're looking for a new car or used car I highly recommend going to Mercedes-Benz Chandler. The level of professionalism and the one-on-one attention that they pay to each and everyone of their clients is phenomenal! They always make me feel important and at home every time I go, even if it's for a small service. It seems to me that all the employees at Mercedes-Benz of Chandler go out of their way to accommodate their clients and make them feel welcome. I have never had any experience with a car dealership as positive as I have there.

I highly recommend Nate Rodgers from the service department. He is always professional and prompt in returning any phone calls or online requests. He will work with you if you don't have a lot of time and will accommodate you in anyway so that your experience is not just satisfactory, but you end up walking away feeling really good about the decision of purchasing a Mercedes-Benz at Chandler. I know this may sound fake, but I am completely sincere when I say that I tell all my friends about what a wonderful experience I always have when I come there.  I especially enjoy when Mercedes-Benz of Chandler have their promo nights where they have catered food and entertainment!! I love bringing my friends and showing them around as they seem to also enjoy the experience of how friendly everyone is there!  It's always a fun time, not just looking at the new cars, but meeting up with their employees and all the hospitality and free gifts they have to offer everyone! I can't imagine buying a car from anywhere else! As long as I live in the Phoenix area I will always go there! I have to say that the famous logo of Mercedes-Benz ""The best or nothing"" is absolutely true!

Once underway, they correctly sold me a cabin air filter (an item on the inspection list). The filter they showed me was unquestionably the one from my car, and certainly needed replacing.

The drinks are fantastic. There really is no comparable place in Madison. Sometimes I feel like I could have ordered something a bit better looking around at other plates. However the menu changes regularly enough that you are always trying something new. I'll definitely keep coming back. It's way better than places like Sardine , graze, four quarter, and especially harvest (most overrated place in Madison).

I've had a burger which is very good and their club sandwich is one of the best I've ever had. While I haven't been out there myself, the patio is huge and inviting. I just wish they had draught beer- although it's my understanding that's not their fault.",1.0
Wife and I were craving a burger so decided to give Bobby's Burger Palace a try.  The wait staff was extremely friendly but the host Briana who took our order not so much.

"Went here for a celebratory dinner while in Vegas. There are a lot of great tables, and a couple crappy ones. We fortunately got a good one, but I could see how someone could be upset if they got seated basically facing the mall, for what you're paying in food. 

The food itself was very good. The Beef Carpaccio my dad got as an appetizer and boy was he surprised. It's basically a full meal in itself. If you aren't splitting it with at least another person, you're crazy. It's like saying I'm going to have the nachos platter as an appetizer. Look at the pictures; it's huge. That being said it's one of the most dynamic and interesting dishes we had that night, and sticks in my memory months later writing this review. 

I had the scallops for dinner, which had some interesting sea beans which made for a deep, briny flavor. Not for everyone, but I enjoyed them. 

So ya, if you can, ask for a table outside or at least away from the mall side. If you're looking for a cheaper meal, go with the flatbread. More reasonable (half price) compared to a full entree, you'll leave full, and the people around us seemed to be enjoying them.",1.0

"Wanting a quick bite and decided to try something new. Never been here before and was wow'd the first time walking in. Never expect this contemporary décor when enjoying Asian\/ Vietnamese food.  The wood all around the restaurant, multi leveled, and the beautiful 10-12 seat bar was warm and welcoming,  the aroma around the restaurant made us hungry, I was very excited to see what they had to offer.

After still talking about the décor, the server arrived promptly with menus and the specials of the day.  I was excited to try the entire menu, but settled on Pho Tai Nam. Yes, it's about 98 degrees that day and I decide I wanted hot soup, don't judge!! My friend ordered the Belly Buns. Although, I did not get a chance to try her dish, she couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  My soup was awesome, what was great about the dish was the after part.  After having Pho, at some places, I become growingly thirsty, not so much with District One's pho.  It was full of flavor, right about of onions, and did not have whatever component that makes you thirsty. Kuddos!!

I am excited to see this place make it big, very different concept. The food was definitely fusion, I mean where can you get fish tacos and chicken wings at any other Vietnamese restaurants.   I love the marrying of different flavors, cultures, and ingredients;  the unpretentiousness, that is what food is all about. 
Sure, this visit was brief, but I will definitely be back to try it out again and again.  Next time, I'll bring more reinforcements and will venture into the King Crab, Oysters, and the Down and Dirty options! Can't wait! Great job, great first impression!!",1.0
"Excess. Schtick. Zero f***s given. That basically sums up Heart Attack Grill.

On the doorstep of Fremont Street, Heart Attack Grill is everything you've heard and more. The scale out front, eating free if you're over 350lbs, the hospital theme, the spankings if you don't finish your meal. This is Vegas excess at its best and HAG knows it. They admit it. They will gladly take your cash (and it is cash only), thicken your arteries some more and laugh all the way to the bank while doing so. 

My friends and I stopped by after doing the SkyJump and were eager to fill our bellies after nearly emptying them several hundred feet in the air. We weighed ourselves for laughs, entered and got geared up in our hospital gowns and took a seat in the sparsely populated restaurant in the optimal pre-lunch rush time. We were seated quickly and given menus, which we flipped through while enjoying the culinary sideshow that HAG has made itself out to be. There isn't a large selection, although what they have comes in some very large sizes, the most infamous of which is their cheeseburger with eight half-pound patties and 40 slices of bacon.Vegetarian options? They openly mock this by calling their cigarettes this. Diet pop and light beer are blasphemy here as well. Our waitress\/nurse (nursetress?) was super friendly and sat down with us to give us the run down on the menu and how things worked there, especially that if we didn't finish our food we would be spanked with a paddle. And she would gladly do it. And many people over the course of our meal were; there must have been a dozen just when we were there that marched up to the centre of the restaurant, grabbed a hold of the contraption over which you bend over and are video taped on, and paddled...hard. The videos of your face while being spanked are posted on a website for all the viewing masses of the interwebs. Oh, and you can shell out several dollars to buy the paddle with which you were spanked as well, because why not? Another opportunity for HAG to take your money, you filthy animal. Despite knowing the paddling penalty, I made the unfortunate choice to get a side of onion rings in addition to my single burger, which I got chili and cheese on as well. 

It wasn't a long wait, but I wouldn't have known if it was anyway, with everything there is to look at here - the paddlings, the classic movie posters that have been changed to be food\/HAG related, the Jello shots being given via plastic penises and over-sized needles. On the wall above the counter, two projectors play clips of HAG making the news, giving the ultimate middle finger to their detractors. Remember those news stories about a couple of guys having heart attacks here? Those will play. Eat up, chubby. Overall, the atmosphere is like a frat, diner and hospital mashed together, but the energy is fun and contagious, as every swing of the paddle brings about cringes and cheers alike. 

When our food arrived, it was intimidating. My burger was a single but was still a hefty size and the onion rings were some of the biggest I've ever seen, not to mention that they filled their own basket. No skimpy side order of a few rings here.
The burger was one hell of a hot mess; the patty was a little on the dry side but the chili was plentiful and good, if not an amazing example. The onion rings started out good, but thick onion rings tend to be soggier anyway, and when you have a big basket to battle through to avoid getting your ass literally beaten, it got less than enjoyable pretty quickly. Luckily there was a bunch of ranch to help the soggy, greasy rings slide down my gullet until the very last one was gone. Having paddled both of my friends, one for not finishing and the other since it was his birthday, our waitress had been keeping a close eye on me as well, but luckily for me and her 
tired shoulder, I did finish my meal.

The food was pretty meh, but Heart Attack Grill is a damned fun spot. They're probably not even trying to have good food. The owner has boldly said that he prays for the day that no one comes in his restaurant because it will mean that America has finally gotten its health together, but until then he'll gladly line his pockets with  the cash of funny loving saps like you and me.",1.0

My primary reason for trying Funke Yoga was the proximity to my home and that it is one of the few studios that are not ""hot"" yoga; I have continued to come because of the reasonable monthly and per class prices and the great vibe of the studio.  One big difference to note in this studio is there are no mirrors.  As someone always checking my alignment and keeping an eye on the other yogis to make sure I was doing the right thing this was quite an adjustment.

Also, the flavors are inventive and fun!  However, you can never go wrong with a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting.  My favorite!  What I love the most about Urban Cookies is that the cake is always, always moist and the frosting is never overly sweet.  I'm always saying to people that Urban Cookies has the best cupcakes anywhere.  If you're new to Phoenix, or just visiting, I recommend putting them on your list to visit.  Don't forget to try the cookies, too!  After all, cookies is in their name.",1.0
"It is restaurant week and we finally went and had a good experience. 
First- I like that it is BYOB, we got to bring a great bottle of french wine and not pay the mark up but simply a $10 corkage (however, next time I will bring my own glasses, not a fan of thick glass wine glasses).
For appetizers we had the tomato goat cheese tart and mussels. They were both very tasty.
For the main course we had the lamb shank and the chilean sea bass. The lamb shank was fall of the bone tender and wonderfully flavorful - the sea bass on sea bean salad was really really good- very well composed and balanced.
The desserts were very good too - Hadden liked the peanut butter chocolate the best and I like the Brown Butter Peach. 
Good food, nice intimate but casual setting. This is a definite Phoenix must-try and a great date spot.",1.0
"Okay, okay. So it's busy, and loud and crammed (to be read as communally intimate). But oh so so so worth the wait and the elbow-rubbing in and out of your seat.

The food is delicious. Green curry, red curry, panang curry, massaman curry (okay, so I love curry, you got it!) AND the pad thai AND the khao soi - all so yummy in my tummy. And it's all spiced well without compromising flavours.

Wait staff and patrons have always been nothing but pleasant. You get a little bit more attention at the bar than on a corner table, but most of the time you'll be too lost in sampling the best thai food in Toronto (I kid you not) and competing with your vocal cords in this always-full restaurant.

All of which makes for a great date night. Without breaking the bank. Cha-ching!",1.0

"Allgemein
Das Bärenschlössle ist ein ehemaliger Jagdpavillon aus der Zeit König Wilhelm des Ersten. Vorher stand hier bereits ein Lustschloss aus dem 18. Jahrhundert, erbaut von Herzog Karl Eugen, welches nach seinem Tod jedoch vollends verfiel. Auch der heutige Bau musste nach Schäden durch Krieg und Brand mehrfach wieder aufgebaut werden.
Im Erdgeschoss ist eine kleine Selbstbedienungswirtschaft untergebracht, die den großen umliegenden Biergarten mitversorgt. Im ersten Stock befindet sich ein Veranstaltungssaal mit umlaufender Sonnenterasse.
Wir sind heute hier nach einem Geburtstagsausflug in den umgebenden Rotwildpark.
Bedienung
Sowohl im Biergarten als auch in der Wirtschaft gilt Selbstbedienung. Die jungen Servicekräfte hinter der Theke sind trotz des großen Andrangs freundlich und verbreiten keine Hektik. Der Betrieb funktioniert reibungslos und flott. Alle Achtung denn an Sonnentagen wie diesem muss hier von früh bis spät sicher einiges geschafft werden.
Das Essen
Die Speisekarte ist vorwiegend schwäbisch gutbürgerlich mit einigen Vespergerichten und wenigen, nicht allzu zeitaufwendigen warmen Speisen. Daneben gibt es noch ein reichhaltiges Buffet an selbstgebackenen Kuchen.
Wir entschieden uns für:

Bäreneintopf
Wurstsalat mit Käse
Spiegelei mit Bratkartoffeln und Salat
Spätzle mit Sauce
Die Gerichte waren deftige reichhaltige Hausmannskost, wie man sie nach einem ausgedehnten Spaziergang unter freiem Himmel gern hat. Allesamt uneingeschränkt zu empfehlen. Den sehr lecker anmutenden Kuchen haben wir leider nicht probiert, da zu Hause schon einer auf uns wartete.
Alles in Allem solide und schmackhafte Küche mit ordentlichen Portionen zu angenehm günstigen Preisen.
Das Ambiente
Der Gastraum ist recht einfach gehalten mit kleinen Tischen und Holzstühlen. Durch die relativ kleinen Fenster wirkt er etwas dunkel, trotzdem denke ich wird es hier im Winter recht gemütlich sein.
Umso einladender ist da der weitläufige Biergarten mit mehreren Terrassen, urigen Massivholztischen und -bänken die über Sonne und Schatten verteilt sind. Drumherum befindet sich ein Spielplatz, eine große Wiese und einige Bänke am Hang zum See. Auch die Sonnenterasse mit kleinen Tischen im ersten Stock ist nett hergerichtet und bietet einen tollen Blick auf die Parkanlage.
Überhaupt ist der umgebende Rotwildpark eine Reise wert. Viele gut ausgebaute Wege, Seen, Spielplätze, Grillhütten und kleine historische Gebäude ergeben ein zauberhaftes Ganzes in dem man den ganzen Tag vertrödeln möchte.
Sauberkeit
Alles ist soweit in Ordnung. Obwohl die Toiletten auch von den vorbeigehenden Spaziergängern genutzt werden sind sie relativ sauber.",1.0
"I read Meghan Horvarth's review and I told myself that I would order the House Burger. It was a good decision. It has one of my favorite combination in the world: Bacon and sunny side up egg, both on top of a beautifully seasoned burger. Nicely toasted buns, it was pretty darn awesome!

However, I would not recommend the Brats platter on their menu, it doesn't worth it in my opinion. My friend and I ordered that because we were having Spotted Cow at the time, the delicious beer tried to trick us into thinking that the dish was worth it, but I was sober, so no chance of deceiving me on that. 

The Cheese curd is pretty good, but a little bit greasy in my opinion. 

One thing that was off about the restaurant was the flies. I waited for 20 mins or so to be seated right next to the window, I was congratulating myself on getting a good seat, then i heard buzzing. I thought it was my stomach, but it turned out to be a bunch of flies. Do not sit near the window. It's a trap!!!",1.0

Not the quietest place, but an excellent atmosphere. Nice beer choices too! Front was open and fireplace was inviting.

I'm going to keep this short. This west end bar is literally a hole in the wall. The entrance is non descript, and can easily be missed. Once inside, it's long, narrow, and super rustic, with a perfectly warm and inviting interior. It was a weeknight, and it surprised me as how busy it was. Great vibe, with a great live band. I love live bands.

It was packed, but the staff still managed to be super sweet, and friendly. All in all, I was impressed and can't wait to come back. Did I mention, it's a great place to bring your date?!

"Großartiges und dabei unkompliziertes Fischrestaurant im Herzen der New Town von Edinburgh!

Welcher Städtereisende kennt das nicht?
Nach der anstrengenden Anreise und einer ersten Erkundungstour durch die Stadt hat man so richtig Appetit und Lust, die lokalen kulinarischen Köstlichkeiten zu entdecken und zwar ohne sich dafür zuvor noch in die große Robe werfen zu müssen.
In solch einer Situation kann ich das ""Mussel Inn"" wärmstens empfehlen.

Fußläufig von den wichtigen Sehenswürdigkeiten und den meisten Stadthotels in Edinburgh gelegen, versteckt sich das Restaurant in einer Parallelstraße der bekannten Princess Street und bietet Seafood in allen Variationen.

Meist sehr gut besucht, empfiehlt sich zwar eine Reservierung, aber mit ein wenig Geduld kann man auch am Wochenende einen Platz in dem kleinen, lauten und quirligen Lokal ergattern.

Wir starteten mit Baguette, gesalzener Butter und der ""Creamy Seafood Chowder"", einer Spezialität des Hauses.
Die sahnige Suppe war deftig, herzhaft gewürzt und einfach köstlich. 
Große Fischstücke, sowie Krabben und ein wenig Speck wärmten unsere Mägen und Seelen, auch wenn die große Portion nur tapferen Essern als Vorspeise zu empfehlen ist.

Die nachfolgenden frischen Muscheln in den Varianten ""Shallot"" und ""Blue Cheese"" wurden mit knusprigen Pommes an hausgemachter Mayonnaise serviert und waren nicht minder schmackhaft als die Vorspeise. Gekonnt abgeschmeckt war auch der Muschelsud eine Delikatesse, die selbstverständlich restlos ausgelöffelt wurde.

Begleitet wurde unser Mahl von einem frischen und unkomplizierten Pinot Grigio, der uns von der aufmerksamen studentischen Bedienung empfohlen wurde.

Ich würde sagen: Ein äusserst gelungener Start ins Wochenende in dieser traumhaften Stadt für knapp 80.- € inklusive Essen, Wein und Mineralwasser.

After several years of enduring treatment with miltary doctors who rushed you and acted like you were wasting their time by being there, I knew when we came home to Vegas, Dr Michaels would be my PCP again. She has always been patient, she listens to you, and it feels like she cares about you as a patient. The office staff has always been friendly and efficient. And there is a Quest lab in office for added concenience. I would recommend this office to anyone in Vegas, as I know good medical care is in fact difficult to find here.",1.0
"We came as a family of 8 for our first trip and we were really happy with our night! The service was great. We sat on the patio because it was so nice outside, but unfortunately they do not have any lights outside so it was pretty dark. I mean, we had to use our phone flashlights to read the menu. Anyway, we ordered the mushroom pizza, the house and the bbq. The mushroom was soooo good and different! The other two were yummy but we especially enjoyed the mushroom! Only 4 stars because they need lights on the patio and the others two pizzas were about a 7\/10.",1.0
"Our son has been attending the Pre-k program at La Petite Academy for about 6 months now, and every day has been such a blessing. From the moment you're greeted at the door you're welcomed with a friendly face, and such a kind staff. Everyone we've encountered here has been nothing but helpful, patient, and warm. 
Our boy is quite a handful, and it gives me such a sense of relief knowing he is in such good hands everyday. He truly enjoys all of his teachers (Miss Denyel and Miss Maribel), and looks forward to going every morning. They seem to know exactly how to keep him enthusiastic and engaged.
We have decided to enroll him in private kindergarten as well, as he's learned SO much in their pre-k program in such a short time already! SO grateful to have found this school, and if they offered every grade til HIGH SCHOOL we'd be keeping him there indefinitely.

"Arrived on a Sunday around 12:15pm and it took less than 5 minutes to get in through the ""Invited Guests"" line. I definitely recommend contacting a promoter and getting yourself on a guest list. My promoter told me that ladies get in free that day until 1pm. We went in a 4:1, ladies\/guys ratio. We bought the guy's ticket ahead of time since he wouldn't be able to get discounted admission anyway. Luckily, they let him through the ""Invited Guests"" line too, so he did not need to enter through general admission.

They are pretty thorough, and strict, with bag checks. They threw away our empty Fat Tuesday Yards even though they were empty! Towels are provided. Lockers are $10 each. Amongst 5 people, we managed to rent 2. They also have black bags where you could try fitting as much as you can in each. They then give you a wristband for you to redeem your items later. Lockers are not one-time so you can go back for your stuff, though the line always seems to be long, so I wouldn't advise doing so. Definitely try to bring as little as possible!

The restroom\/shower area was gorgeous! They even provide hairspray and body spray in the women's restroom. The shower area is outside so you can only rinse, not take a full shower, unless you don't mind being nude for everyone to see!

It was pretty crowded, but there was still enough room to move around in the pool(s). Zedd didn't start playing until around 3pm\/3:30pm. Once he came on, everyone rushed to the front of the stage.

"We were in Fitchburg for the first ever Fitchburg Flea Market on Sunday and decided to stop by the Pancake Cafe for brunch.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated immediately at a large booth in the ""upstairs"" section (which is really just raised up from the rest of the seating. This was perfect for my family with 3 potentially rowdy kids.

My kids shared a half order of chocolate chip pancakes (three total) which was the perfect amount for them. I didn't try them, but they looked delicious. (I posted a photo...see for yourself!) I had the Southwestern Omelette which was pretty okay.  It didn't have a ton of flavor, but some salt, pepper and sour cream helped.  The hash browns were perfect, and I also chose toast as my other side, which was some very tasty sourdough or something of the sort - not your typical restaurant white bread. The orange juice was clearly fresh and had great flavor.My husband had eggs, meat, hash browns, toast, etc.  He, the man of many words, said it was good.  That's all I could get out of him. ;)

So - the food was decent. Not amazing, but totally acceptable.  What really stood out to me, however, was the service. Every single person we encountered working at the Pancake Cafe had a smile on their face. Our waitress was incredibly helpful. She brought our baby a dish of applesauce at no cost and was the one that informed us that we should probably just get half order of pancakes for our kids. She checked on us exactly enough to be helpful but not overbearing, and she was very quick with the check and the payment, which is always appreciated when you have lots of kids who are finished eating and ready to go!! The hostess was nice and waited for us as we slowly made our way to the table. A bus boy stopped by our table to compliment us on our cute baby. We even heard someone singing away in the kitchen as they cooked, which tells me they must be pretty happy at their job.  

So - is the Pancake Cafe the best breakfast restaurant in town?  No - but it's a great place to take your family. They have tons of options and excellent service and the next time we are in Fitchburg we will probably go back.",1.0
"I just bought a home that needed an entirely new roof. You could tell the previous owner had patched the roof many times over the years but it was time to retire. It was a composition shingle roof with a very large patio and extra detached garage. When I had Mark from Aladdin inspect the roof during the inspection period he gave me real scoop on what needed to be done and didn't pull punches but also let me know where money could be saved. I appreciated that. The seller had gotten a low ball bid of their own that did not include the patio so I really needed help putting together a realistic idea of what I was going to have to spend. After speaking with a couple other roofers as well, I had a pretty good idea that the roof was completely shot and I asked Mark back out to the property for a full bid. Not only was his bid more comprehensive than the other two roofing companies but his was also 15-20% cheaper. 

Once the deal closed Mark's crew was out at the property same day delivering materials and getting it done. His timeline was spot on, and after 5 days, we had a new roof. It looks fantastic and my wife and I could be happier with the outcome. I'm in the real estate industry so I see second hand how many roofers don't execute effectively on their promises. Mark and his team really set the bar high and I'm stoked to have a great roofer that I can now recommend to family, friends and clients.",1.0

I'm the kinda person who dips their fries into their Frosty... so when I heard about this place, I thought it was ingenious. 

The two flavors of ice cream that I mentioned above had a great creamy, smooth, consistency. I also tried the French toast ice cream: for that one.. The flavor was spot on but the texture wasn't as perfect as the other two. Now, don't get me wrong, even the French toast was way above what you might get a a grocery store...

Next time I am in the area, I will probably go for some different flavors to try - maybe be more adventurous and try some of the crazy flavors - basil, etc.

The only issue is I can't eat onion either and many vegetarian restaurants usually pile their dishes full of onion. At Henderson's Bistro this didn't seem to be a problem at all. I ordered the nachos which were gluten free, then just omitted the salsa and instead had a delicious bean salsa. It was delicious! Plenty of cheese, sour cream, guac and nacho chips. The freshly squeezed orange juice was really nice and we had a chocolate nut cake for dessert which was nice though it was quite heavy. The service was good and the bistro was obviously quite popular as it filled up around us. The menu is small but has a good range of options for everyone. I'd certainly eat there again.",1.0
"I wanted to thank the service department manager at findley honda centennial. We have always been very pleased with the service staff and the workmanship at this dealership.  Today I took the car in for service and was waitig to get a ride back to work. There was a mix up and the shuttle left without me. I had no choice but to ask to get my car back since I could no longer wait for the shuttle to come back.
As soon as service manager heard about this incident he personally got a car and gave me a ride. Thank you for tuning a bad service incident into a good deed and good business.",1.0
"Stopped in for dinner as part of a mid-week date night with the Mrs. We were seated almost immediately, as there were plenty of open tables and not much activity. We apparently had just beaten the dinner rush. The ""El Jefe"" margarita came highly recommended and with good reason. Made with Patron Silver Tequila, the El Jefe was big and strong, as a good margarita should be. The complimentary chips were hot and fresh and our waitress, Lenore, was on top of her game. I opted for the Tex Mex Cobb Salad. Loaded with fresh ingredients and plenty of chicken, it was a nice break from my typically carb heavy mexican choices. I went without salad dressing and topped it with salsa. It was outstanding. The Mrs. got the Enchilada Suizas. Of course, I had to steal a few bites for Yelp review purposes. The Suizas were delicious and were complimented nicely with refried beans on the side, loaded with cheese. Dinner for two, with the El Jefe's, ran us just under $50.00 including tax. The food was great, the service was fast and friendly and they had baseball on TV. A solid four star performance from OTB.",1.0
"I've been to Morgan's about 5 or 6 times, and every time I've had a great experience.  They have an interesting and rotating selection of beers, with a few permanent ones (no reason to ever permanently remove Guinness!), and a good mix of local brews and brews from afar.  

The service is top-notch:  friendly, helpful, cheerful, kind.  The gent behind the bar has an old school touch, whipping up fancy cocktails and bantering with the customers.  

Their food is very good.  I've tried the fried chicken, the burgers, wings, and mussels, and all are excellently prepared.  The fried chicken is something they're known for, and it doesn't disappoint.   I've seen people request substitutions, and each time the staff were happy to accommodate.

The place is dimly lit, with chill music playing quietly (jazz, indie, lounge, etc).  There are tables, booths, and bar seating, and the place has character.

"Saw the recent reviews for this place, and we just had to check this place out. Located right in heart of the revamped DTLV, behind the eclectic famous ""Fremont street"", Carson Kitchen is hidden with no large sign, the food speaks for itself. 

 As we walked in we were greeted quickly by the hostess. Very nice, sleek, tiny restaurant with a cute small bar, open concept with views to the kitchen.

The food: small menu, small portions tapa style maybe? 
We got the...
Tempura Green Beans: good flavor not overly battered comes with a pepper cream cheese dip. This was good. 

Beef Wellington Empanadas: 2 in a order, not bad flaky crust comes with a sherry sauce? Idk but this was nice. 

Crispy Chicken Skins: comes with honey dipping sauce. Think of fried pork skins.. Super crispy, this would go excellent with a nice cold beer. Good flavor, a bit on the salty side. I feel like this didn't need the seasoning really. 

Caribbean Jerk Turkey Burger: eh I didn't like this. Maybe the fact that I don't really care for cole slaw, which by the way was the only thing in it. Burger became soggy. It had a pumpkin spice kinda flavor and it was kinda sweet ehh.. 
 
I liked when each item came to our table the server described what it came with. The food came out in good timing. We were there for probably just 45 mins. 
The service was good she checked on us a few times. This place would be great after a night of drinking and you want something good, and savory! But they close early in Vegas standards at 11pm.

I visited this location for about an hour on 2 different days - once for frame selection and once to see if they worked thru my insurance issues: both instances I received and witness exceptional customer service by Clara.

"This place is definitely authentic Cuban cuisine.  We ordered the Cuban sandwich and tostones (fried green plantains).  The food was delicious!  As another reviewer stated, the bread was a bit crumbly.  I grew up in Florida, so I have had plenty of Cuban sandwiches in my lifetime, so I know that the bread is supposed to be somewhat crumbly, but it was a little over the top.  Also, it was a to go order, and it took about 30 minutes for us to get our food.  Slow, but worth it in my opinion.  Next time we will just call ahead.  My husband made a comment about the cashier\/waitress's personality (or lack thereof), but I didn't really notice anything.  She was really busy though, being the only one who was taking orders, cashing out customers, bringing out the food and cleaning the tables.  I would be miserable too, poor girl!  Anyway, the crumbly bread and slow service are what made me take away a star.  However, we will definitely be back.  It's hard to find Caribbean cuisine in the valley, especially as good as this!",1.0

I'm slowly making my way through the signature cocktails. Thus far, I really like the VIP. Every time I go in, I always order the Philly cheese steak egg rolls. So good! You really can't go wrong with anything in here, although I am partial to the chicken schnitzel. 

Happy hour runs every day from 3 to 7. $5 cocktails, $3 beers and $6 apps.

While waiting for our table, my boyfriend and I sat at the bar and had a drink- the drink menu was very impressive. It had a nice verieity to choose from and none made with vodka which i loved. I ordered the English Garden it was great- great flavors and a beautiful presentation. The wait staff was well educiated with everything on the menu and made great recommendations. I ordered an appetizer as my dinner because like I said I am very picky - the angus beef sliders- I do not regret it. They were amazing - small but perfect size for me. I also ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes- bite sized potatoes with sea salt and a truffle glaze-they were outrageous! Overall I had a great experience and I recommend trying it out.",1.0

I've been to a few specialty candy shops but this is by far my favorite.  The person working(owner?) was so helpful and had THE perfect personality for someone who runs a fun and quirky candy curio shop.

The first round, you get to try all the meat and then after you can order some more meat. But the 1st round was more than enough for us, we didn't even order anymore after. Really enjoyed the food and service.  There were 2 ladies that were serving us and they even cooked all the meat for us.  We were supposed to be cooking the meat but they cookedit for us the whole time and we let them.  They were very sweet.  We also got the banchan which they refilled for us many times. We were full and didn't even eat the chicken which we wanted to cook last.  I liked the pot belly the best. Can't go wrong with this place if you are very hungry and want Korean food.",1.0

I was very happy and appreciative that they offered a vegetarian burger option, as well as a shrimp and grits sans shrimp. We ended up sitting outside on one of the patio tables, which was perfect because the weather was incredible and it was much less crowded than inside. Further, we schmoozed with the chefs to make sure we could get the first samples before they headed inside. I would say that being inside seemed a bit overcrowded, but who can say no to attending such wonderful events? Thanks again to Rachel for another fun event.",1.0

It is one of the more expensive Indian restaurants, at least for butter chicken anyways. But it was worth it.

"I like this place for a once in awhile go to for homemade matzah ball soup! You can get it without noodles and just enjoy the goodness of soup. Probably best in town. They try to give you that deli feel we get back home but they don't put pickles on the table anymore and it's gotten further away from a NY deli thru the years. The sandwiches however are nice and thick loaded with fresh meats. The bakery section is quite small compared to others and the challah is better other places. But the food is good and enjoyable, if you get deli food, not a burger.... (Like someone at our table did....)
The customer service has been variable the times we have been there and the cleanliness has varied too. Not sure if because of how long they have been there or what but hasn't been remodeled. Depending on when you go, you can be waiting awhile too as the place is quite small. I like this place and the local business but overall it's changed a lot thru the years!",1.0

"This location shares their front door with Shibui. As you walk into the reception area, you have a choice to head downstairs into Shibui or upstairs to be seated in Copacabana. On the third floor, there seems to be a lounge and bar sort of deal going on. The sign outside is kind of understated so you gotta pay attention or you might miss it when you're walking by.

The service was reasonably quick on a Wednesday night at around 7. Most of the tables were filled and you could smell the delicious meats as the servers passes your table. Earlier in the night, servers also walked by with corn bread and cheese balls (should really try the corn bread!) Once you grab a plate and fill it with your selection from the salad bar, servers will know to come by with various selections of meat.

I thought the pasta\/salad bar was pretty average. The cheese and prosciutto selection they had also wasn't that impressive either. However, some dishes to try on your visit: their cole slaw, mussels, and sweet potato mash. These were the only ones that really jumped out at me. 

Onto the meats: we didn't see any filet mignon, pork ribs, or turkey breast last night, and pork sausage was by request only - it kind of tasted like chewy spam. I particularly liked the buttermilk steak and Moroccan spicy chicken. Anything with the cheese was also very juicy and tender but a tad salty. My friends also enjoyed the chimichurri prime ribs. Lamb and beef ribs only came out once, which was a bit of let down as we did enjoy those. As a whole, the meats were well flavored, tender, and very juicy. Everything was cooked until a medium rare which I loved.

The pineapple really lived up to my expectations - dusted with a bit of cinnamon and perhaps sugar, it had slightly crunchy edges and was very sweet. Our table loved it and we asked for seconds the next couple times they came around. Definitely something you should try. It would have been nice to have a small selection of fresh fruits after the seriously heavy meal though. 

For the price, this restaurant is something you'd want to try at least once, and for a special occasion only (they charged us a dollar each for water with no notice). Their focus is really on the meats, and that's where you get the most bang for your buck. Go on an empty stomach and you'll have a great time sampling their Rodizio grilled meats.",1.0

In the morning, we called the Plumbing Medic, and a very polite dispatcher said that they would send someone out in 60-90 minutes.  Well, 45 minutes later, Francisco came out.  He was dressed in a uniform, put covers on his feet so he wouldn't scratch our floor, was polite and patient, and extremely patient.  And most of all, he quickly solved our problem, and then took a look at a few other issues that we had around the house.

"Like most west valley Asians would say, Great Wall is a staple.  I've been to Great Wall a hundred times for dim sum and banquet-dinners since I was  kid --- heck, maybe even since I was born!   It's hard for me to even imagine how my childhood would be like without Great Wall.

From before their renovations to days before the kitchen fire, Great Wall has always served up delicious food.  As it is the only major Chinese restaurant in the west valley, Great Wall is always busy with a flurry of customers at any given time of day.  They have delicious hot dim sum and they have an even more amazing 10-course dinner.  If you don't understand Chinese customs, this place will always be LOUD!  Chinese people are loud.  We like to hear ourselves talk over other people's voices.  I think it adds to the charm of the restaurant.  ;)

Great Wall specializes in a lot of authentic off-the-menu dishes like duck tongues, fried pork intestines with sweet & sour sauce, fried fish heads with eyeballs the size of golf balls, and all the other stuff probably not palatable to people who didn't grow up around these kinds of foods but it's all reminiscent of  majestic China.  *wistful sigh*

Every single purchase at Baby Stop has been 100% quality and the customer service is outstanding! Often times I run into the store with little time to spare (since I have a 1 year old) and the staff promptly and happily helps me...even if they are on a break! Fantastic customer service and the owner, Kate, is absolutely a true, caring, geniune lady who goes out of her way to make sure you are taken care of with white-glove service.

So for a once in awhile treat I say do it!,1.0
Although the food is not great it is still a very fun place to go. It is not every day you see a place that serves fried chicken and waffles on the same plate in Scottsdale Arizona. If you go you have to try the Kool-Aid.,1.0

"We chose to stay at Bally's because of it's location on the strip.
Upon arriving at the hotel, we asked about an upgrade, and for an additional $20 we got a Jacuzzi tub and a view of ""The Linq"".

The good:
Location on the strip can't be beat, right across from the Bellagio and connected to the Paris. Didn't feel like I had to walk too far to anything. Close to bus stop out in front. 

The room was nice and clean on a non smoking floor.

Spacious floor plan and comfortable bed.

Multiple sinks and great vanity area for a girl and her makeup, there is even a little stool to sit on. 


The not-so-good:
The tile in the bath area is ridiculously slippery when the slightest bit wet, and the shower temperature and pressure was poor. 

Whenever someone above or below you uses their shower, the loud sound of water wakes you up, as does the sirens on the street passing by multiple times a night. I, however, had a terrible head cold on my trip so I had trouble sleeping anyway.

The pool was closed and construction being done at the entrance.

I understand Vegas isn't cheap, but $3.50 for a bottle of water in the shop downstairs? Room service has a $20 minimum plus delivery fee - they wanted $15 for hot water for tea?! Luckily I didn't bother. 

No mini fridge - maybe only suites have them?

I know people don't come to Vegas to watch TV in their room, but since I had the aforementioned head cold, I had to come back to the room to rest and the channels are extremely limited. Mostly Vegas ads, and Japanese channels.


All in all, the location trumps the other issues and I would stay here again (next time with no cold!)",1.0

We offered a restocking fee, but he refused to accept. Send all your friends and family here for Christmas and year around.",1.0
"I don't know why there seems to be so much hate for this place. From how it was explained to me, Primanti Bros. isn't necessarily famous for the quality of the food, but rather for it's culinary place\/purpose in the history of Pittsburgh. I know it's probably hard to separate one's own experience from expectations raised from the Food Network hype, but this place is, and always will be, just a place that serves over the top, greasy, heart attack inducing grill food.  If you're coming here because you saw this place on a list, you're probably going to be disappointed.  

Seeing the grill, the shabbiness of the establishment, and reading over the menu helped to manage my expectations pretty quickly.  It's a greasy spoon restaurant, plain and simple.  Thankfully I have a soft spot (probably several soft spots with the amount of times I visit places like this) for grilled and fried monstrosities.  I think a mistake that people probably make is reading on the menu that the 'Pitts-burger' is the #2 seller (after #1, beer), and subsequently ordering it with the thought that #2 ='s 'best thing on menu'. This is probably a HUGE mistake Primanti Bros. makes by advertising it.  Our waitress, who was certainly an incredibly friendly oversharer (read:  brutally honest) said that she didn't really care for the Pitts-burger compared to other burgers around the city that she's eaten, despite it's popularity.  She actually gave us her top 3 menu recommendations, and we ordered those instead.  I ate the pastrami and cheese sandwich, which I thought was very tasty.  I had never had fries and coleslaw IN a sandwich, and the flavor was different than what I was expecting. I washed it down with a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, which I was happy to see they had on tap.  The prices for everything were all very reasonable for a 'tourist trap'.

Everything is either walking distance or a very easy short ride away. I must say that the rooms have been renovated and makes it stand out well above other hotels in the area.  The bathroom on the other hand, has not been renovated and still shows it's age.  Never the less, this is a must stay when you are in the western suburbs of Cleveland.",1.0

"Came here for lunch on a weekday. Plenty of seating, no reservations needed. 

We ordered two dishes: 

Octopus 13.95 (9\/10) -the thinly sliced marinated octopus served over arugula was light and delightful. The portion was sizeable for lunch. The dressing on the salad was just a touch too heavy.

Steak salad 24.00 (9\/10) - This is a dinner menu item but the chef was willing to make it for lunch. A simple dish with three grilled beef tenderloin medallions served over an arugula salad. The juicy beef tenderloin was grilled to a perfect medium rare. Ordered dressing on the size, but all the greens seem to have been pre-doused with a heavy hand of balsamic vinegar. 


Rating Summary: 
Food: 9\/10 - Excellent Food, just a tad too much balsamic on greens. 

Atmosphere: 10\/10 - Perfect spot for a lunch meeting. Modern décor, spacious, plenty of seating and music volume wasn't overbearing.

"We order from here frequently and the food is pretty consistently good. Lately, the food has been piping hot and fresh. It doesn't taste like someone's incorrect order was reheated and stuffed in a to-go box. Sometimes you order fried rice from a restaurant and it tastes old, dry, and looks way too dark. I'v e never had that problem here. The combination fried rice is a staple in my household.

I love the green tea smoothie and original milk tea. The boba pearls are hit and miss. Sometime they are smooth and chewy perfection, sometime they are hard and gritty on the inside... Try your luck if you enjoy boba, when it's good, it's good!

I tried the curry chicken, but it was mostly quarters of green bell pepper and and white onion floating in a very thin, almost watery curry sauce. There were literally two nickel sized pieces of chicken in it...

"Well what can I say. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I come here a lot. It just has everything in one place. It's far enough from the sometimes overwhelming buzz of the strip, but has a full bar in case you still want to catch a buzz of your own. They have friendly servers, dope atmosphere and cool decor but what really does it is the food. Man I can eat here every day. 

They have traditional vietnamese dishes, like pho and BBH. All pretty good, and being that I come from living in LA and OC the land of vietnamese food I can say it's comparable to some of the better spots out there. As far as Vegas goes it's one of my favorite spots for pho. The quality of the meat in particular when you order it raw is better than most out here. And the oxtail pho, man. Oxtail everything is good and they have good oxtail. But what really kills the game is their specials. Where else can you get lobster pho? Nowhere. At least not till they brought it. They always have fresh seafood specials like oysters, crab, and crawfish. I've eaten basically everything. I could keep going on and on but better to let you try it for yourself. Here's a few recommendations tho. 
Lobster garlic noodle. Their version of it is so bomb. 
Black pepper lobster. I'm a fan of black pepper already but with lobster?????
Beef carpaccio. My go to appetizer. 
Oxtail fries. Because damn. Oxtail. And fries, but if you don't feel like french fries then try my all time favorite dish here...

"Our final foray into a new dining experience with Restaurant Week. 

We arrived to find noca in a strip mall. It is not a stand alone restaurant and it is a little on the small side but their food and service makes up for it. 

Our ""greeter"" would also be our waitress. I say waitress because we had 4 different ""servers""...which was fine because it kept the transitions very smooth and seamless. the meal started with an amouse bouche (sp?) of carrot puree and walnuts. it was a quick taste of the great food about to be had! 

i started with the parsnip soup. it was creamy without being too rich. flavorful pecan halves were sprinkled on top to add some texture. for my entree, i had the oil poached cod. it came with seasoned couscous and some lightly grilled vegetables. my first bite came off as ""good, but not overwhelming"". but as i took my time and tried not to wolf the meal down (working on actually enjoying food vs functional eating all the time, the fish seemed to taste more flavorful. it was very soft but the al dente couscous added some crunch and the subtle flavor of the oil started to really soak in. 
after the meal, we were treated to a heaping bowl of grape cotton candy-can't remember when i last had fresh cotton candy. then had the real desert: 2 warm and cinnamon\/sugar coated mini donuts with a small vanilla milk shake ""shot"". absolute deliciously divine.

"I was very hesitant to go here after reading many of the reviews. There was a Groupon and I had great experiences at poorly rated restaurants in the past so I went with it. My husband and I were celebrating our anniversary along with the first time away from our kids overnight and we wanted good food.

Server: We had Constantin for our server. He was incredible. He was welcoming, friendly, comedic (appropriately), and down to earth. Where some people give a lower level of service when you have a Groupon he did NOT. He even reminded us that the Groupon includes dessert and to save room!

Ambiance: I did get the feeling that they tend to seat Groupon customers closer to the bar area so you don't get the full feeling of the ambiance of the restaurant however it was still a great table and the bar wasn't loud at all. (In fact our drinks likely came faster because we were near the bar.

Food: Where do I begin? WOW! I was beyond impressed. Perhaps I had low expectations after reading some of the poor reviews but I LOVED everything! My favorites: the bacon wrapped filet mignon, the flank steak, and the roasted chicken. These were incredible and my mouth is literally watering thinking of the flavor and juiciness of these foods. I was there only two nights ago and I am still drooling! The salad bar is wonderful- try the fried bananas! The white chocolate cheesecake- phenomenal. I was too full to finish all of it (Constantin had warned us!) but it was SO good! 

The waiters kept coming around with more and more meats. I could have sat there and ate all night however we had a show to get to and I was STUFFED!

Comes with housemade bread and butter too. The pasty choices are numerous and we couldn't decide, so we started at the top with the original Oggie.

Service is top notch from both the Servers and the Sushi Chefs.  They are attentive and always check on you.  If I had to nit pick on anything, the fried calamari isn't season, so you would definitely have to dip it in the sauce provided with it, or with some soy sauce.  Occasionally, there would be either a mix up of orders, or they forgot something.  It doesn't bother me.   All you have to do is tell them, and they will get you what you want right away.  The restaurant is small, but the ambiance is great.  Just gotta be aware if you are bringing a bigger group.  Also advise that you order the bake rolls at the beginning since they take time.

"This restaurant is about the dining in the dark experience, not so much about the food. I came here a while back, so I can't remember what I had, but it was decent, but nothing special (wine was good, though). I would rate the food a 3, and the experience a 4 - 5 (depends on who you are with and how fun you make it). I laughed a lot, and had a great time, and it was overall a cool experience. One of the people I was with interestingly mentioned that the restaurant doesn't have to worry about the presentation of the food. 

I would recommend coming here at least once. I think this is a great first, second or third date idea. I also recommend having some drinks to make the experience even more interesting.

"Wow!  Amazing Panzerotti!  I got the baked and it was and it was huge!  It comes with cheese and sauce and added soppressata (which made the Panzo bit salty) and mushrooms to the mix.  It is very cheesy with not that much sauce that I expected  in the  Panzerotti so I suggest getting the sauce on the side, the meat sauce is really good.  Damn, the sauce is amazing, real traditional Italian sauce.  I came here with a group so I did sample some of the pizza and a fried Panzerotti which were all amazing.  Now I wish I was there right now enjoying another mouth watering Panzo while writing this review, lol.  

I also had the wings (meduim), they were huge and cooked to perfection.  They were a little crispy on the outside and very moist.  The sauce was good too with a little kick, unfortunately they were drenched in the sauce so most of the sauce had to be wiped off for a full maximum wing eating experience.  I'd suggest asking for just a little bit of sauce on your wings and just get some dipping sauce on the side.

My boyfriend kept talking about this place EVERY time we came to vegas, so of course we decided to come. 

The first time we came, we were lucky only waited about 45 minutes. I ordered the gumbo which was amazing. They ask how spicy 1-10 you want it.  I got 7 and it was spicy. If you can't handle a lot of spice, I would suggest you get 5 or lower. They cook everything right in front of you which is pretty cool. My bf got the panroast which is the most popular.

"My first pupusa experience was a hit! Had never tried El Salvador food, and wanted to try something new so my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out, and I am glad we did.

The restaurant is very tiny, hole in the wall type place. Posters of El Salvador on the walls..making me want to travel there! Our server was nice, did not speak much English, but that was not really a problem. I am not sure if we misunderstood and we were supposed to go up to the front and order, because we would ask her a question about an item, she'd answer, then run off before we could order!

The food was yummy! I got the squash and cheese and the bean and cheese pupusa and they were both awesome. The squash and cheese had a bit more cheese than I would have liked, as I do not eat cheese often, but still was appetizing. It also came with beans and rice on the side. I wasn't used to eating liquefied beans, but I did enjoy them.

For dessert my boyfriend and I shared the nuegados de yuca con miel. It was a little odd for my taste, but obviously something I have never had before. If I go again I would want to give a different dessert a try.

OH and when you visit their website, you can find a coupon for 10% off your first visit. Though the food is pretty inexpensive, not that big of a deal if you forget the coupon like I did haha.",1.0
"Honesty is a hard quality to find in someone especially in a mechanic. I've been going to Steve for years, three cars later and a move to Charlotte I'm still going to him and wouldn't take my car anywhere else.

I started going to Steve just because I needed my car inspected. After that breif interaction with Steve I knew he was a mechanic that was on the up and up. It's a small shop with just two spots to work on cars. Steve is the owner and his son is also a mechanic that works at the shop with him. He can get pretty busy so I like to make a appointment before driving to Kannapolis from Charlotte, I suggest you do the same.

For some reason I have terrible luck with cars, all I wanna do is get the oil changed and put gas in it. Anything above those two things I'm a topical girl and know nothing about it. The first car that Steve worked on was a 1995 Nissan Sentra (still running might I add), from oil changes to brake replacements he did it all. Always at very reasonable prices telling me exactly what I was paying for and how much the parts were. After what I thouhgt was a up grade to a 2010 Chevy Malibu Steve continued to work on that. Unfortunately that car had MORE then a few problems! Steve did fix a few things on it, but he finally said enough is enough telling me I shouldn't keep putting money in that car. Now I've got a 2012 Chevy Sonic and I trust Steve to work on that too.

Everyone needs a trustworthy mechanic, Steve is definitely that!",1.0

"The service by Peter, the owner, was excellent. We were greeted and served promptly.This place is pretty good, but very under-advertised. The menu is extensive, but if you are in for flavorful and succulent Thai and Chinese food, then this is your place. 
We had the steamed mussels as an appetizer, and they had just enough seafood flavor with the ginger and herbs in the clay pot, we did not need the dipping sauce. I ordered the Spicy crispy duck with minimal spice and it was so good and fresh. The portions were just right and the prices were affordable.
My daughter ordered the wont ton soup, twice. I tried the simple broth and the flavor wasn't overpowering or bland, but just right. My husband ordered the ginger seafood medley, it was cooked to be savory and delicious. Even the thai Iced tea was very good and not too sweet.
To be honest, this place is similar to Lotus of Siam, but with affordable prices. Just sayin'....

"I won't write much here, as I don't really do franchise reviews...and, actually, I've already written a review for another Sprouts location (or two?  I don't remember and can't be bothered to check...).  So, if you want a better run down on Sprouts, in my eyes, having shopped there for almost 5 years, please check my profile.  For now, this is a quick run down of this location.

On the downside, some of their stock is different than what we'd grown accustomed to in Salt Lake City.  The bulk section is larger, but some of the products we regularly purchased are either not available or not offered.  The teas, in particular, are not as great a quality, and they don't seem to have any fair trade teas.  Oh, and we couldn't find maple extract anywhere.  Sad day.

As for the staff, they are stellar.  There are a few faces in particular that we see and who we have been helped by.  It's nice that they seem to remember us and are especially friendly because of that.  The times we've needed help finding an item, or getting more on the shelves they have been stellar.  Once, when the ground ginger bulk jar was empty, seeing as it cost half as much as any of the pre-bagged items, the guy who helped us gave it to us free, no charge!  Really, they're friendly, helpful and never act like they're begrudgingly helping you.

And that's all folks.  If you're in the area (sadly there aren't any sprouts on the south or west side) then it's worth coming here.  We generally drive about 5 miles to get here.  But Sprouts, and specifically this location, make it worth the drive.  And, thank the gods, we have a car.",1.0

Parking is easy, right on the corner next to Crudo. I was quickly greeted by a very friendly server who took me over to the cooler to pick out my beer of choice. Ended up having a nice hefeweizen from Temecula, CA.

My friend and I decided to split the cheese board, $14. They were out of the brie that comes with it, so they upped the size of the other cheese portions. The goat Humbolt Fog was my favorite. The board comes with dried fruit (similar to the kind you find in trail mix), spiced almonds (loved these) and a very interesting apricot compote (it actually tasted like sausage, but i think i liked it.)

The atmosphere is cool and comfortable. It looks like they have some great grab-and-go options as well.

They serve breakfast tacos daily from open till 10 am and you're able to add in items if you get there before 10, if you're after 10 because you slept in, it's still okay because they have the breakfast tacos ready to go in a heater right by the cash register, it will always be a perfect moment for you.",1.0
"I went on a crafts expedition to Michael's in Ballantyne today. Right next door: TRUE Crafted Pizza. I mean, it makes sense to get a pizza for yourself at 11am... right?

This is one of those places where you walk up to the counter and order. They bring your food out to your table when it's ready. Overwhelmed by the menu (not that it's massive or anything... just a lot of solid looking items), the guy at the counter walked me through options. Traditional, specialty oven baked, grilled. I went with his suggestion of the garlic & clams oven baked pie. Clams, pancetta, roasted garlic oil, parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Delicious combo... although probably not the best for the breath. No vampire stands a chance after this. I had to stop myself from eating the entire thing in one sitting. 

The bar area is really nice. TRUE has a lot of local beers on tap. I went with Root Beer. Hey, it was 11am... someone has to be an adult. Workers were all super friendly. Prices are fair. Gluten free options are also available. 

I don't venture out to the Ballantyne a whole lot... that parking lot known as 485 frightens me... but I will be coming back here again during my next adventure out this way. There are a few more pies I must try... plus I didn't save room for any gelato today. Such a rookie mistake. I will be back.",1.0

Now at the salon, we were greeted with huge smiles from both of the women at the front desk, they quickly helped us figure out our best matches for our hair, gave us options to drink, and actually remembered them as soon as we were both finished with our washes.

"Touristy, yes... tourist trap? No. As far as touristy places go, this particular Hard Rock wins. I can't remember the last time we had such great service. Like, anywhere. Not only was our waitress phenomenal, informed, helpful and friendly, the manager even came by and had very personable, genuine conversation. We had Four adults and four kids, including two infants, and yet they still treated us like stars (yay!) They brought out a huge dessert after we had paid, just because. ?! I've never seen something like that. Oh, and one of my kids wanted an egg to eat, and they actually just fried up one (which wound up being three, I think) for her. A lot of places won't do that (sad, but true.) 
So I'll spare you the description since I'm sure most people are aware of what Hard Rocks are like, but you can definitely count on great service and good food (the kids meals were fantastic too.) With all the potentially horrendous tourist experiences in Vegas, this is a sure bet. Highly, highly recommended!!",1.0

I loved it. They were very accommodating, allowing my family to bring our own food in. All the wine was provided by the winery. Before the festivities started each table took turns doing some wine tastings at their tasting bar and picked out a couple bottles for their table. 

For the person who gave their wine bad reviews, I think they are probably just trying to be snooty or didn't try very many of their wines. While I didn't enjoy them all I did find a couple varieties I really enjoyed and took a bottle home with me.

If I was hosting a similar party in the future I will definitely keep them in mind. I loved the atmosphere.",1.0

Situated in a supermarket (yes a supermarket!), La Plaza doesn't disappoint. First, the supermarket is quite great, for your Latin-infused dishes and just finding some good produce and brands that would be hard to find in Cleveland. And now the tacos.

They're just randomly situated at the front of the supermarket, making tacos. 2 bucks a piece. Super delicious chorizo, al pastor, and carne asade, with lots of different sauces. It's hot and fresh and oh so delicious. We tried them all and they were so so good. The meat is plentiful, and the sauces are oh so good. They had a good amount of sauces, with each sauce being tasty.

Hands down best Mexican food I've had so far! And so close to home!!! 

Their menu is huge!
You get to choose if you want burritos, tacos, nachos, fries, bowls.. Then they have 12 kinds of meat to choose from and they have veggie toppings, ie soyrizo (soy chorizo).. Variety of toppings.. And a big side and sauces bar.. I mean can you ask for more?!

This morning we were in line waiting to order we have never ordered breakfast close to 10:30am lunch switch so we called from the line to ask if we could order breakfast before they stopped serving breakfast. They had absolutely no problem and we're kind and courteous over the phone. Good job management and thank you to all the employees. We love the car who comes to the drive through if you have kids every so often :) while chickfila is a tad pricier than other fast food the quality of the food and service are well worth it.

Amazing places like this need to be supported so I hope Yelpers will help make them popular. Yes, the prices are high, but udis bread at the store is also $6 and not half as good as this stuff. 
Hopefully they'll open up a location near me soon and I will go there at least a couple times a week.

This place absolutely rocks !!!!",1.0
"First and foremost, lawyers should be problem solvers. Garrick McFadden is a competent lawyer who solves problems and delivers what he promises. A few years back, I was involved in a contract dispute with a car dealer in the Bay Area, California. Garrick made it possible for me to unwind a deal that was not fair and equitable. His advocacy helped me restore my credit and put a bad experience behind me. If I lived in Arizona or California, I would hire Garrick McFadden to solve any problem I had.",1.0

I ordered the leaning tower of Caplansky's, which was this stuffed French toast made with challah bread and layered with blueberry compote and stuffed with cream cheese topped with beef bacon.  My husband had a smoked meat scramble.  Both were really good and not too sweet.  We also bought some smoked meat to go and my husband got a nice lunch the next day.

"Came here for a brewery tour on Labo(u)r day, and it was a great experience! We made reservations for our group of 4 in advance, and the check-in process was easy. We arrived a few minutes early, paid for the tours and selected our souvenirs, and had time for a sample while we waited downstairs. 

The tours begin upstairs, and we were all given headsets. I've been on a lot of brewery tours, and I have never gotten a headset before. It was actually really useful- there was no shouting, it was easy to hear, and had the added bonus of discouraging bozos from shouting out witty remarks over the guide. Our guide was knowledgeable, friendly, and courteous. We found it interesting that the brewery has no interest in expanding into other varieties of beer, but that they want to be the best pilsner brewers in Canada. I respect that!

We were all given bottles of beer for the tour, and were then offered additional samples. We hung out at one of the tables up there for an hour or so, and didn't feel pressured to leave at all.",1.0
"I wanted to try this lunch buffet since reading some friends' reviews and I went today.  It's taken the #1 spot in the Indian lunch buffet spot with one restaurant yet to go.

I was there early, about 11;15, and I was the first person in the restaurant.   There soon were several other customers.  It's a very large room with lots of tables laid out well and the buffet is a large area opposite the entrance.

With a check in on Yelp, you get either a mango lassi or a soda free.  It's a good deal for merely checking in.

I ordered garlic naan and then headed to the buffet.  The naan was good but I wish it had more of a garlic flavor.  For the first plate, I had chicken Biryani, a couple vegetable pakoras, a vegetable samosa, a piece of tandoori chicken, some chili chicken, soya badi, and some saag paneer.  Everything I had was very good and I noticed that almost all dishes had a spiciness that I liked.  Of these, the weakest dishes was the saag paneer.  The crust of the samosa was flaky and the filling was very good.  The soya badi was quite good.

For my second plate, I had squash, Navratan korma, chicken curry, and chana masala.  All of these were very good save the squash which was a little nondescript.  I also tried some of their raita which was good.  The chicken curry didn't have very much of a curry flavor but when the juices from the chana masala mixed with the curry juice, it became much better.

Finally, I went back and got one idli and put a small amount of tamarind chutney on it.  It had a soft texture and was good.  I was a but disappointed that they had no dhokla.  I had read Christopher S.' review and I was interested in trying something different.

Overall, this is a very solid buffet and moves to the top tier of Indian restaurants.  The price is now $10.99 but that's still very good considering the wide choice you have with their large buffet.

Service was very good!  Several times, someone stopped by to see how things were.  A woman stopped once and asked me if it was too spicy so they know that they spice their foods.  Plates were cleared before I came back each time.

This is another stop for after hiking when we go to an Indian buffet.  It's a great addition to the Indoian dining in Las Vegas.",1.0
"Thought this location was probably one of the better ones in town. Came here on a Saturday morning, considering the amount of people, the wait was less than 10 minutes. They have outside and inside seating. The service sitting outside was not so great, but it's worth it if it's a nice sunny day :D 

Excellent breakfast spot. And great if your trying to eat light and healthy as well. The menu has a variety of options, eggs (durr) waffles, pancakes, breakfast meats, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, and the absolute best part MIMOSAS AND SCREWDRIVERS. I wasn't impressed with the mimosas but holy moly the screwdriver was served in a mason jar and deceptively strong :D

I had two eggs, WHEAT Banana pancakes, and a fruit granola parfait. The eggs were de-lish, especially when I sprinkled some of the provided greensauce on them. I admired how they made the pancakes with real cut banana slices cooked inside them. And I think the menu description ""short-stack"" is somewhat of an understatement, try HUGE ROUND STACK of three pancakes. Also, try sharing them with someone else, too much for one in my opinion- unless you're a beast. The fruit parfait was disappointing- too much yogurt, not enough granola or fruit. 

Of course this chain of restaurants is most famous for their banana nut muffin- and yes- have one, you won't regret it. Overall, great spot for an early breakfast with friends and fam.",1.0

The place is run by Chinese people so do expect Chinese service. Food will come very quickly.  No one is going to come to ask how your food is and  I don't mind that.

The interior of the restaurant was designed with a lodge cabin theme and was cute and comfortable. The food was typical pub food and fairly priced.

"Went in yesterday for lunch as I'm exploring new places around work. It wasn't difficult to see from the street, but their location is in an oddly designed plaza. The restaurant was only partly filled, just over half the tables were empty. The two employees behind the counter could tell I had never been in before, and they offered to suggest a sandwich based on the things I liked. I decided to play it safe for the first time out and got an Italian with bacon.
I heard their commercials so I knew their bravado for speed, but I was wholly unprepared for them to prove it.  I turned from the register to fill my drink cup, and before I could finish getting ice, my order was ready.

We have had a slab leak and our insurance company provided Yack Construction for the repairs minus plumbing...we handled that before insurance got involved...Yack and their subs have been fantastic.

"As a neighborhood semi-regular (at least once a week) at The Lakes Einstein location, West Sahara near Ft. Apache, this is a great place for a quick and delicious bagel and brunch without fanfare.  It is New York in LV.  I adore their new scones - especially, the cinammon ones, which are flaky (but not falling apart as a good scone should be), the quick service, the good coffee, the seat yourself and line-up for your order speediness - and the overall friendliness of the staff.  I enjoy their egg sandwiches, which, upon request, will be made to your specifications.  Mine is on a challah roll that is lightly toasted.  If I close my eyes, Iam back in Brooklyn, NY, at a neighborhood bagel place with more than bagels!  The disposition of the very busy staff makes it great for what it is - a quick breakfast or lunch...their bagels are not too doughy, have a slightly well-done crust and satisfy your hunger.  
The only thing I do not like, is the fact that sometimes there are meet-up groups that gather there and take up so much space (and waste seating for real customers) and those who sit at an area meant for two or more and read a book for hours.  This should not be a hangout, but a quick eatery",1.0

I arrived about 5 minutes late, but it was no problem (+ called to let them know) they didn't seem to mind. Upon arriving their amazing receptionist, seriously shes so nice and has great phone etiquette, checked me in and showed me where I could pick my color. Once seated I had two girls attend on me, for the life of me I can't remember their names and I even called back twice to get their names but they were amazing. They are down to earth girls who make you feel at home, like you're getting your nails done with your best friend. I really appreciated how they knew when to talk to me, ask me questions etc. My gels stayed intact for very long time, and I got compliment on the color everywhere (samba something?), my toes were also amaze. The me bath, is like a little spa treatment for your feet, I highly recommend if you need a little extra love and relaxing in your life. Overall I left happy, and with beautiful hands and feet. I made another appt right away. If you're looking to relax, laugh, have a good time and get your nails done I would recommend this place! LOVE.",1.0

The decor is very modern minimalist, and the patio was lovely - perfect for a warm Fall evening. Our server was friendly and attentive all evening, she never intruded on conversation but seemed to find the perfect moment to jump in and see how we were doing. I ordered the Garden Truck Chicken Sandwich with extra avocado (how could I not? I'm a sucker for avocado...) which came with waffle fries and fruit. The sandwich was super delicious, and the avocado took it to the next level. The vegetables were fresh and added a great crunch to the sandwich, and the chicken was well cooked. I can never resist waffle fries, but I thought the fruit was a bit of a weird choice; it just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the dish.

I had a local IPA with my sandwich, which was very good! I would have liked a little more assistance in choosing my beer from the server, but I can't complain - I'm a local beer fiend, and I can't blame other people for not knowing every in and out of their local beer scene!

We talked about normal everyday life, made me feel like I was in a nice coffee shop or book store but getting a haircut and minus the coffee, very relaxing. After 15-20 minutes of getting all of my Jesus hair removed and having my beard trimmed I looked like Adam Levin.

"Headed here with a co-worker and grabbed up one cupcake each to enjoy with our coffees from next door. They definitely have a lot of frosting on them, but nothing that kept me from enjoying the cupcake overall.  I had a chocolate on chocolate cupcake that had a ganache like frosting on it.  

I ended up taking a bit of the frosting off and simply not eating it with the rest of the cupcake, so they could definitely save themselves on cost by not putting so much on there, but the cake itself was done well and the frosting tasted great once you removed a touch.

The staff was super friendly and answered a couple of questions we had about what was in each of the ones we debating on. They have adorable little boxes that they put them in, and they are great for transport without the cake falling over and the frosting getting everywhere.

"The Ballpark! One of my friends has been raving about this place for many months and I finally had the chance to go myself!

Well I will say one thing first. The main courses are mostly meatballs, but the appetizers and side dishes are an eclectic mix that leaves me quite surprised!

We started off with an appetizer course of calamari. Now I relatively new to calamari, I would say in the last three years, but this is hands down some excellent fried calamari. The batter is just perfect and well seasoned and the calamari itself is cooked proper, not overly chewy. 

We also had a beet salad, which was quite good but very hard to such up! I am not sure what green they used, which while good, had stems which made it unwieldy.

Meatball wise, I was lucky to be in a large group and as such we ordered all of them. We ordered the 7 available that night and we were white stuffed at the end! It's all a lite bit of a food black out but I will say in particular that I liked the meatball with blue cheese. For the other preparations, most were excellent and a couple were only good, which is still pretty alright!

Special side note for the delicious tempura veggies!! These were hands down some pretty delicious tempura items. I think they have the whole frying thing figured out what with the calamari and the tempura and they should expand it!

"My friend and I got the pleasure of attending the grand opening of Boneyard Grill's Toronto location near Lawrence station. The interior setup is much like a family diner, unlike most BBQ restaurants I have been to. We got to try an array of their popular dishes, notable their ribs and coconut shrimps! I have to admit, I don't remember having ribs so delicious and tender before! The meat simply melted off the bones! My friend and I kept piling our plates with them! The pulled pork sliders and chicken wings were tasty as well, among their other menu items. Honestly, none of the food I tried disappointed me.

If Boneyard Grill opened late, I think it would be a perfect place to go to after some late-night partying. It's also a good family dinner if everyone is craving for some delicious BBQ! If you aren't in the midtown area, they have their original location up in Thornhill.",1.0

"If it wasn't for our server, this place would have gotten 1 or 2 stars. We tried to get a table inside but the hostess said it would be 10 minutes but she could get a table outside right away. When she takes us outside she realized that the table hasn't been cleaned so we wait for it to be. While we wait a table inside finishes and leaves. We asked if we could sit there but she said another party that had just got there was going to sit there, Even though she knew we  wanted to be inside.  We  ended up sitting outside but didn't get any water or service for another 10 minutes when they tell us that the table inside opened up so we walk inside and wait another 5 minutes to see the server and bus boy arguing about who is giving us water cups. Just pathetic. We went ahead and ordered the meatballs and hummus as a appetizer, the pear and gorgonzola salad, and a large pizza for 4 people to share. The meatballs and salad were great but the pizza came out before we got the hummus so we had to tell them to forget about it. In the end the server felt horrible about the service the hummus that she handled a few items on the check but the Pizza was great (we got half chipotle pizza and half veggie.",1.0
"Nobody makes Italian food quite like my dad did, so I'm usually let down when I try any Italian restaurant, but Miele's did not disappoint! 

The restaurant is small, but clean, cozy, and nicely decorated. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, and most importantly, the food was delicious!

My mom and son tried the spaghetti with meatballs--which was great because the sauce actually tasted good and well-seasoned, not like Chef Boyardee, and their meatballs were moist with excellent flavor--while I opted for the butternut squash ravioli. If you love tarragon as much as I do, then I definitely recommend the butternut ravioli. 

The adult entrees also came with a side salad which had one of the most tasty Italian dressings I've had in awhile, and the bread was also delicious.

For dessert we tried the spumoni ice cream cake, which was good, but not my favorite part of the meal. 

While it may not be my dad's cooking, it's still pretty darn good, so I will definitely be recommending it to my family\/friends and be back to try their other dishes!",1.0

The only downside is that it gets really busy if you go during usual lunch and dinner peak times, so I end up not always having enough time to eat during the time allotted for my lunch. I can't always blame the restaurant for that though.

In the end, if you're looking for some burritos or tacos quickly and made with good quality, this Chipotle should suit your needs.",1.0

Crispy bun, beautiful haggis and the best beef every. Would highly recommend. Great pub atmosphere. They don't take reservations for food but just turn up and be amazed.

"This is a great gym if you really want to train. It's inexpensive and there is enough equipment that even during the busiest times you can still get in a killer workout. If your thinking of getting personal training the trainers there are excellent. The head trainer TJ will usually workout with you for the first session and pair you up with a trainer. Whoever you get all of the trainers there are GREAT! 

Sean, who is my trainer, has helped me make some serious gains in the past 6 months after I had leveled out and was not making any working out on my own. With his help I have perfected my form, substantially increased the weight I can lift and have improved my definition. 

As far as the contracts... they are pretty easy to understand not sure why anyone would have so many problems. As far as customer service goes I had a problem where my bank had issued me a new card because it had been compromised. Because of it my payment did not go through and I was charged a late fee. I explained the problem and gave them the new card number and they happily reversed the fee. So I'd say their customer service is pretty good. 

Also, the locker room and the facility is clean and for you parents they even have daycare.As part of the membership they also have numerous classes that are available.

"Yum, comfort food.

I went with some friends for dinner here. I got the kielbasa with sides of pierogies (50c extra) and corn on the cob. It comes with a garlic roll and unlimited trips to the salad bar.Well worth the $11-something I spent here.

I loved the kielbasa! I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I had fresh, homemade kielbasa but it was appropriately salty (compared to the packaged ones at the store which are almost always too salty for me), had a nice bite to the outside and was moist. My corn on the cob was actually a whole corn! A lot of places cheap out by giving you canned\/frozen corn or half a corn on the cob, but this one was the whole thing. And it was moist and flavorful. The garlic roll was fluffy, and the pasta and potato salads were tasty as well.

My only criticisms were that one of my pierogies may have been sitting out for a while and developed a bit of a crust on the bottom so it was not as pleasant to chew on, and the lettuce was too ""wet"" so my dressing didn't quite hold on my salad. I mean, I guess if anything, this means they wash their produce?

My friends got heavier dishes (or they just don't eat as much) so they took a lot home. I'm a little jealous they get to eat more later by reheating at home while I actually have to drive there for more.

"So we tried ordering from these guys on Memorial Day. I went online and didn't see anything posted about whether or not they were taking the holiday off. When I called, I got put on the answering machine loop explaining that they were taking other calls but did you know that Rustic pizza bla-bla-bla. Anyway after 5mins on hold I decided just to drive over there as I live close by and indeed they were closed for the holiday. Now they could have changed the machine message or posted something on their site, but hey I get lazy too sometime, and actually doing that takes a bit of time and everyone is entitled to a holiday. I was more disappointed than peeved, as my wife and I had drooled over the menu and had taken the time to decide what we would order before we actually tried calling. Plus I was a tad Hangry so there was that too.
For what it's worth,  the Fresh N easy next door is open 24\/7 so I went in there and grabbed 2 DiGiornno  frozen pizzas for 12 bucks and after 20min in the oven were FANTASTIC!! Frozen za has come a long way! So if you are ever at Rustic and they are closed, grab some DiGiorno! It's tastes like delivery! It really does!
Last night, we decided to try Rustic pizza again and so we ordered a half pepperoni\/sausage add mushrooms and half Green and White. We also added a bakers dozen of their baked chicken wings. The order came promptly, and we were pleasantly surprised that it was a woman driver. Our first one ever!
The food from Giant Rustic Pizza was AWESOME! The pizza was HUGE and the topping were bountiful and tasty. The crust was thin and bubbly and crispy, the cheese rich, the sauce delicate and delightful! The chicken wings were also really good and baked to perfection!

"I started going to My Car Guy a couple months ago simply to get an oil change because I needed one and Adam was offering the lowest price for one out of all the ads I had received in the mail. I've had horrible experiences at ALL the car places I've ever been to, so I figured I'd go to the cheapest one possible. 

Lo and behold, there were a few other things wrong with my car. And I just so happened to be taking a small road trip the very next day. Adam was extremely nice and explained to me what was wrong with my car and quoted me a price. Not knowing anything about cars, I texted my cousin (who is a car mechanic) and asked if he was quoting me a good deal. My cousin agreed that the price was very fair and that was good enough for me!

Since then, I've gone back to him for all my other car issues. He's extremely fair with pricing, explains everything (beyond my car understanding, quite frankly), and even offers a discount for ASU students like me! He also is great about working to get your car fixing as quickly as possible for you! I'm pretty sure they have gotten all my car issues done the same day of the problem so far.

"I don't visit Vegas often, but I go enough to appreciate the value of location and quiet. Situated within Caesars, Nobu Hotel is both in prime real estate as well as being utterly tranquil. 

Contrary to other reviews, I didn't find noise to be an issue at all - I was situated on the 78th floor (lobby is on 72) and there's no way noise from the clubs on ground level are an issue.

The room (we had a double Queen) had a forgettable view but was well appointed, clean and while not spacious by Vegas standards, was certainly not small; the bathroom was a tier above in terms of space (surprisingly so) but the appointments within matched the general room quality: good, but not break-the-bank luxe. I'd peg it around level with the Mandalay Bays of this world, and perhaps a shade under the Wynn or even the Hard Rock, where the suites are pretty cleverly laid out. There's not much to differentiate any of the typical suites between the three I've found (although I've only ever shared an elevator with LeBron James at the Wynn, so I'm biased.)

Nobu Hotel did distinguish itself in that not only were we able to check in at 9.00AM (we were coming from LA so it's not as if we could play the 'we've been travelling across the universe to get here' card) but a late check out (midday) was also accommodated at no extra charge. Kudos.

The gym was sparsely appointed - but what was there was of good quality. The cycling machines (and I'm sure the one elliptical and treadmills) had a touch-screen based entertainment interface integrated which looks very fancy; sadly the internet wasn't connected to them (or wasn't functioning) leading to patrons stabbing away at the screen trying to make YouTube and other apps work only to go nowhere. 

You could definitely see what Nobu Hotel is trying to achieve on the service front; staff were helpful and friendly in a very earnest manner, but a little too mechanical, as if there was a very stringent set of patron-engagement guidelines that must be adhered to. I can't speak for everyone but I prefer a more relaxed approach - but I can understand that in Vegas - moreover in a Nobu themed hotel - that's not going to fly. 

Overall - the niggles are way too trivial to hold against the hotel. I'd definitely consider staying at Nobu Hotel again. Including the multiple taxes that accompany staying at a Vegas hotel, I paid approx $220\/night there for a double queen - definitely solid value.",1.0
"Allgemein
Eine Freundin von mir geht immer sehr gerne ins tialini und da wir in der Gegend waren, dachten wir uns, dass wir es auch einmal versuchen. Wir waren noch recht früh dran, 18 Uhr, aber schon jetzt war es noch Glück, dass wir ohne Reservierung einen Tiscch bekommen haben. 
Das Restaurant hat mir auch gleich vom optischen her sehr gut gefallen und auch die Speisekarte macht einen übersichtlichen, aber auch guten Eindruck. Insegesamt hatten wir hier einen wirkich angenehmen Abend und das Essen war wirklich sehr gut. Ich kann es empfehlen auch wenn es an einigen Punkten vielleicht Verbesserungen geben könnte.
Bedienung
Wir wurden an einen Tisch gebracht und nach einiger Zeit kam auch eine sehr nette Bedienung. Die Dame war sehr zuvorkommend und nett. Anscheindend gibt es aber nur einige der Bedienungen, welche Bestellungen aufnehmen und verschiedene, welche die Bestellungen dann bringen. Man muss hierbei sagen, dass ein leichtes Chaos herrschte, zwar kamen unserer Gerichte an, doch manchmal ein leicht zeitverzögert oder auch wusste die Bedienung nicht wirkich, ob es nun für den richtigen Tisch war oder nicht. Letzteres könnte auch damit zusammenhängen, da die Bedienung noch neu war.
Das Essen
Wir hatten uns jeweils für eine Vorspeise (einmal einen kleinen gemischen Salat und eine Tomatensuppe) und ein Hauptgericht (Pizza mit Meeresfrüchten und Rucola und Pasta mit Scampi in Tomatensoße) entschieden. Meine Tomatensuppe war wirklich sehr heiß und sehr gut abgeschmeckt. Ebenfalls war die Portion von der Menge her sehr angemessen und ein wirklich guter Anfang. Meine Pizza war wirklich sehr groß, der Boden wunderbar dünn, der Teig sehr lecker und der Belag auch wirkich sehr gut. Es war hierbei nichts angebrannt und die Meeresfrüchte waren gut gewürzt, die Knoblauchnote genau richtig und auch die Rucola weder zu bittern oder lätschig, sondern sehr frisch.  Meiner Begleitung hat es auch sehr gut geschmeckt, daher können wir das Essen hier nur empfehlen.
Das Ambiente
Moderne Elememente, hohe Decken, grmütliche Beleuchtung und eine einfache Einrichtung werden hier vereint. Genau das was man von einem schicken, modernen Restaurant mit einem leichten italienischen Flair der ""Einfachheit"" erwartet. Die Tische sind dabei meist einfach Holztische, oft auch bunte Tische, die aber eine gemütiche Atmosphäre verbreiten. Insgesamt ein schicker, moderner Laden, in dem wir uns wohlgefühlt haben.

I was looking for a car for my daughter and wanted something that would be reliable and in decent condition at a reasonable price.

Not so with Velocity!   The car was indoors, in pristine condition!   Chris was very easy to talk to and so open about all that he did to the car and how much he cares about not only the experience of buying a used car but how much he cares that the car itself is as good as it possibly can be.

"We absolutely LOVE this location. We have been loyal customers to discount for years and years, and this store specifically for about 5. Troy, the old manager, was freaking awesome. The gentleman here are friendly prompt and helpful. I feel very comfortable here, and never question their suggestions\/advice. I am relatively new to writing on yelp, but wish I had started years ago, especially to rate this place! Yesterday is what prompted me to write this though. 

I had taken my vehicle to the dealer for an oil change, and when they rotated my tires stated I had a nail in one that was not fixable, that it had to be replaced. I told them to note it and that I would take it to discount. I had the store order the tire I specifically wanted, and made an appointment to get it replaced. 

Upon arrival at discount, the gentleman greeted me at the bay and asked to take a look before checking me in. Within seconds he stated it was an easy repair, that the little nail had barely brushed the surface of the tire. He pulled the nail out, did a leak check and within 5 minutes we were on our way. 

As a young woman, I greatly appreciate their assistance and honestly. I was more than willing to pay the $150 for the new tire, but instead they were honest with me. My tires are not quite 2 years old, and they said it was a simple fix.

I usually order the same thing, a mini-chicken katsu with extra vegetables instead of rice, so I can't attest much of the other items on their menu. 

The macaroni salad is fresh, the vegetables steamed, the katsu sauce a good blend of sweet and spice, and the chicken katsu fried to crispy perfection.

As soon as I walk in, they never ask me what I ordered either and I just hand over my credit card while they hand me a bag of my food. If you don't call ahead, depending on what you order and how many people are there, it can take anywhere from 5-15 minutes for your food to come out.

The staff here is super friendly and nice. The older woman behind the counter always has a smile on her face whenever I see here and wishes me a good day. 

On top of that, it's a local business (I believe) and I much prefer supporting small business instead of some huge fast food chain.",1.0
"I would pass this building so many times without even realizing it was a restaurant.
It's in the same plaza as the Running Room and KFC on Hurontario and Steeles.
Quite honestly, I thought it was a church, or part of a the church behind it. 
I just never noticed it!

I didn't mind the food here, I had to give it a second try before I wrote a review.
First Visit:
I really enjoyed my jambalaya pasta. It was small for $19 though. If I didn't have so many appetizers I would've finished it all and still been hungry.
I liked the crawfish and oysters and this was the only time I've tried calamari that I didn't mind (I usually don't like it).
I wasn't a fan of the frogs legs.

Second Visit:
We had the frogs legs (3 for $10)
Pitcher of Louisiana House beer ($14) it was pretty good
Calamari (it was good!)
Greek Salad
Coconut Shrimp
King Crab ($24)
And Salmon
I ordered the seafood penne ($19). I found the sauce watery and lacked flavour. I definitely like the Jambalaya pasta a lot better.
I found the portion size for this was small too, I finished it!!!!

I wish they had fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan cheese for the pasta (this is the second place I've been to recently that didn't offer it).

For dessert we had the apple pie (yummy!), a chocolate ""sundae"" ($4, came with caramel sauce. I didn't like it), and the tiramisu! Super yummy.

The service was not bad, we did have to ask for water refills and the waitress wasn't  around too much.
I would go back again though. The place gave me  good vibes and despite some things about it that I didn't like, there were more things that I did.",1.0
"If you ever get a chance to eat here, I suggest you try the croissants. Everything was super delicious! Even my mother, who is very picky towards non-Vietnamese food, wiped her plate clean. Everything was a pretty nice portion, the price is decent although if you let your stomach rule, the bill might end up quite high since everything is drool worthy just from the description (this is from experience, guys).",1.0
"Our new go to ramen spot here in Vegas and we've been to them all. Not to say that others are junk but this one is now our favorite. It's a little small, but all the best places are. 
 
We are what's scientifically known as fatasses and you'll soon see why.  Keep in mind, the following was only for me and my 5 foot girlfriend. We started with the gyoza and it was seriously good. My gf ate almost all of them and she usually only eats one or two pieces. Then we had an egg with ground pork bowl, which was also very tasty, kinda like shin sen gumi in LA. We also got the small curry bowl (because I love curry) and it was on point! I would come here for just the curry, even though I would have to order a ramen just because my stomach is built that way. 

Those were just the appetizers. Which we demolished. Then we got our ramen. I believe she had the shoyu ramen which I didn't really get to taste, well, because she ate it all. I got the tonkatsu shoyu ramen. I really liked it because usually the tonkatsu broths are a little on the heavy side but this one was flavorful and light. I would like to say we took some home, but no. We finished everything. 

So anyways, we got dessert. Not just a little. We didn't save room for it at all, we just kinda stuffed it in there. We got the Vanilla mochi ice cream. This was only ok. My gf didn't like the skin because it was kind of hard. But we got the mango cheesecake and that was good! It was super creamy. So creamy in fact in inspired me to get the New York style as well. This one was eh.. Only ok too. It was hard and not as creamy. Or maybe it was too cold, probably because we got it after they already closed. 

This is definitely the spot to go if you're craving a ramen fix.",1.0
"It's been a lazy review holiday season so trying to hammer these out in tow. What more needs to be said about an overly recognized deserving Michelin worthy establishment such as JR! We thoroughly enjoyed our thanksgiving dining experience and despite not making it to the regular restaurant due to full booking L'Atelier is definitely no second rate backup plan.

Always the best service level authentic French ingredients and attention to quality. I've dined at L'Atelier in Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore and LV keeps par with the best of them. How can you go wrong with France imported foie gras anywhere right?!

"Dorothy Stone and Ori Dagan were playing at Jazz Bistro last Sunday, so my parents and I went there to watch them. They are AMAZING! I am not big on jazz but the music and performance were just awesome! I totally fell in love with Ori Dagan, he is so talented and handsome :-)
Now about Jazz Bistro. The place is really nice but the tables are very close and you can hear all conversations going around you. I just hate when people talk during the performance, it is such a disrespect to musicians... Food -wise, I had scallops with risotto and my parents had halibut and steak. The food was good, though my risotto was a bit mushy. Wine selection could be better - we had a hard time picking decent red wine and didn't like our choice anyway.",1.0
"A new restaurant in the Yonge and Sheppard area.  The food is served in tapas style.  I dont usually like going to these types of restaurants but i really like the atmosphere at this place.  We ordered the kimchi mushrooms, crsipy shrimp, sweet potatoe fries, grilled salmon, beef and pulled chicken tacos.  Overall the food was very tasty. It didnt fill me up entirely but that wad expected from a tapas place.  I would come back here again for drinks with friends. The entire front of the restaurant is open in the summer so it has a very cool patio feel.  There is enough variety of alcohol to choose from.  I'll come back again!",1.0

"Just tried out this place! What do you mean the food is bland? Loved the noodles & the sauce! Sauce was spicy, sweet & flavorful, all at the same time. I thought the sauce was very original & am eager to try their other sauces, it was so good. This is also not a service restaurant, you get into line, put in your order, pay for it and they bring you the order.The dishes are only as creative as you make it - you can specify any of the ingredients to your taste. I don't like my sauces too spicy but that is what the sriracha is for; when it comes to spiciness, it's such an individual taste, you can always add it & make it as spicy as you want! I won't order a dish again if it's too spicy. The noodles were great!  Just right, not mushy or overcooked, just the right texture. This place is the best of the asian fast food casual places I've been to lately.",1.0
"Tuesday night adventure starts like this... We walk in, are immediately greeted and brought to the lobby. This little swanky couch and coffee table are inviting and we can't wait to sit down. The host brings us a couple drinks to enjoy while we wait for the rest of our party. 

Everyone arrives, plus one. The staff happily accommodated our need for an extra setting and brought us to our table right away. Service throughout our evening was top notch. Our waiter seemed to know when to check on us and when to leave us to it. He provided the kind of service I hope for. 

They don't serve Redbull and Vodka? Is this trending in downtown? Ok, I'll try their freshly prepared Ginger Ale. I added vodka and it was delish. Make it a double!

Every morsel of everything we ordered was AMAZE! Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Beets, perfectly tender street tacos, 'Lobstah' Mac n Cheese, Arancini and Chicken and Waffles! We were pigs and happy to be so. 

The food was impressive and the atmosphere was warm and lively. Generally speaking, I'm a 'louder than most' person. This place was happening and I was able to laugh and chat at my normal boisterous tone. If you're looking to read a newspaper while dining this isn't your spot. It's not a 'library' and that's a great thing!

Cookie dough dessert was strange. We saw it in the menu and were all curious. Then they brought them out with the check. We laughed and laughed... They are exactly what the menu says they are 'mini cookie dough bite'. It tasted just like a bite if cookie dough.

Well I have to say that I was sooo pleased with this restaurant and their professionalism. Waiter was great the food was good and the they respected my request as per my reservations which I would recommend to anyone if you want to get a booth so worth it. The little down side is that I had to remind the staff that it was my wife's birthday but the cake was great. The food was good don't order pasta it's not so worth it and bring your BIG wallet. Ching Ching!! So again if your looking for pasta go to an Italian restaurant.,1.0
"Sunday-Wednesday for $26.95 you get AYCE along w\/ AYCD Hot Sake & Bud Light.

Do I REALLY need to say more???  Ok - you twisted my arm.

The meal was fabulous - the appetizers (I love green oysters), the rolls, the sake - everything was worth every penny.

My new ""go to"" rolls - Ay chi chi (this roll has habanero sauce on it!) and any of the rolls w\/ sliced lemon on them.  They do an incredibly thin slice of lemon - the slight hint of citrus really add something special that I haven't experienced at other sushi restaurants.

This is a bit out of the way for us, but again, we enjoyed the food so much we will definitely be back again...I'm not sure you can beat the value anywhere else in Vegas.

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the service could have been a little more attentive.  All of the servers seem to share all of the tables - which I guess in theory is great, but in practice I think they lose track of what tables they've attended to and which ones they haven't.  We did have to flag them down a few times to fill waters, sakes, and order more rolls.",1.0

There's also a nice selection of food for the little ones, although you're dropping almost $6 on a PB&J or Mac N Cheese. If you order a YOU-PICk-TWO combo you can throw in a dessert item for $0.99.",1.0

"They weren't kidding when they said do Vegas differently. I was a little unsure about the whole no casino thing and not directly on the strip thing, but since I flew in to Vegas for EDC, I knew I wasn't going to be spending much time in my room anyway since my friends and I were a bit ambitious with the pool parties, clubs, and actual event at the speedway. It was SO NICE to have a relaxing setting without all the cigarette smoke you would find in your usual casino resort. It's not too far off the strip and you can always take the tram to aria\/crystals\/Monte Carlo. 

The breakfast is pretty delicious for room service food. The dinner menu ok. It looks kind of unappetizing but it tastes all right if you're too lazy to go out or have some comps available. 

You can charge everything to your room which is cool. 

Housekeeping is awesome. They reorganized our messy stuff on the tables\/bathroom (in a good way) and clean the shower each day for you so it's like your in a new room each time you come back.

Our server was friendly and quick. We had oysters for our first course and they were fresh and came with delicious homemade sauces and horseradish. For the main I had Arctic char with a root vegetable medley and it was spot on, while my date had the fish and chips which was also on point. The desert we had didn't really blow me away, I had the brownie and she had the donuts, but it was fine. All in all the experience was delightful, from the moment we walked in to our exit we felt very welcomed and the food was great. We're for sure going back.",1.0

Keep up the great work Sasa!",1.0
"A great place for releasing some stress and hanging out with friends! I'm in love with their interior design. When you walk in, there are a ton of tiki torches, straw canopies, and funky statues. It seriously takes you out of the Cleveland and makes you feel like you're somewhere tropical :D 

They have such an amazing drink menu! I've tried the Zombie and Painkiller before, and both were absolutely great! The Zombie is definitely not for the weak! It has a strong alcoholic taste, so steer away if you're into fruity drinks :P The Painkiller is almost like chocolate milk! Try this one if you're not into a strong alcoholic drink :) 

The only downside about this place is the parking! There is a teeny weeny itsy bitsy lot beside the lounge, and it fits literally like 10 cars. You can drive up a super steep hill, though, to get to the other 5 parking spots lol. Street parking is also available for those who don't mind a bit of walking.",1.0

I asked for the creamy dijon sauce on the side. I am a health-conscious eater. One of the bartenders asked me how I liked it, and she said how much she loves the food there and gave me an extra tip. She said she orders the chicken ""dry"", to avoid the oils\/butter they use when making it. She also recommended the egg white omelette. Breakfast is served all day, so that is awesome.

"This is a great new location. The building and grounds are really expansive, and it has the feel of a German beer hall and Biergarten.

I'm glad they seem to have resolved that issue.

It's just a tiny place in the Drug Mart strip on Lorain Rd.  Given it was a Saturday night, the parking lot was packed  from Fat Heads.  However, there was not an empty table inside Ohashi.  We decided to sit at the sushi bar and were well taken care of.  

I've been to many sushi places throughout the area and this place has some of the best rolls I have ever tried.  We had the West Side Cleveland Roll, Spider Roll and the Fire Mountain Roll.  All three were spectacular.  Reasonable price, no different than anywhere else.  Will definitely be going back!",1.0
"This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.  

We went for ""brunch"".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.

The food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with ""corned buffalo""... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.  

The service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls). 

A few things of note: 
- 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.  

- They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.

- Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, ""fine, I'll pay for it""... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice ""got it, charge me"".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier ""I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee""... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.  
 
It was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.

"This is by far my favorite place to get some decent wings. Working in San Jose all the time, I've struggled to find a good wing place. Smoke Eaters isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to this place...
The service here is usually top notch. Although sometimes they get really busy and you end up having to wait a bit, but that's with any decent restaurant... The fact that they are always busy should tell you that the food and beer is pretty damn good.
I haven't really tried any of the other food here besides the wings... Although my wife said that their sliders are pretty good as well.
As for the atmosphere, it's noisy, fun, and you get to throw peanuts and peanut shells at your friends, or on the floor... whichever.

So, some friendly advice... If you like REALLY spicy wings, get the Suicide wings... The flavor is great, and they have one hellofa kick!
If you like a little bit of heat with a LOT of flavor, get the El Heffe wings. They are delicious and have a wonderful garlicy flavor. Usually I get half El Heffe and half Suicide...

Chicken shawarma was delicious.  Kids chicken plate my 11yr old and 8 yr olds loved. It is a full plate. My son had the cheese krisp...pita bread with melted cheese.

This is a great place when you need to get a quick dinner.,1.0
"Dad and I went back to Dig This today to this time drive the dozers. It was just as fun and exciting as the escavators, but a new experience too since they have very different controls and the things you get to do are completely different! It was a total blast and we had a thrilling time! Once again the staff was friendly, helpful and fun. The instructors make sure you always know what to do next. Everything is top notch!",1.0
"I've lived in this complex for 2.5 years and it's been a nice place to live in.  My rent is reasonable for the size of the apartment I have in a safe neighborhood.  My maintenance concerns have always been minor (replace ceiling fan, new microwave) and fixed quickly.  My neighbors are quiet (I am on the 2nd floor) and while I have had many different neighbors during my time here - I've had no problems.  The front desk staff is friendly and helpful in receiving packages for me when I am out of town.  My only wish is that they had gated entry as I have noticed a rise in people who drive in to dump their trash in our dumpsters.",1.0

The carne Asada fries were yummy. They were the thick steak fries- my fave. 

Carne Asada is fresh and the salsa bar is small but pleasing. 

I give it four stars because my sister thought her carne Asada burrito tasted kinda fishy- maybe it was the rice?

"I tried Pearl Sushi for the first time this past Saturday. The first thing I noticed was the service. It was Saturday afternoon, and they were not very crowded however, the hosted greeted us with a warm smile, and seated us on the outside patio. The waiter came right over with waters, and asked for our drink orders(NO Blue Moon.)  I started with the maguro sashimi, six pieces, pretty standard for most sushi restaurant; it was fresh and delicious. We also had their Dragon and Rainbow rolls, both were also very good. Being new to the area, and Pearl being SO conveniently located I will definitely be back.",1.0
"Freshly made sandwich shop w\/ a great breakfast menu before 11am. Prices are better than Capriotti's and the sandwiches are huge. Very casual atmosphere, walk up deli. It feels like you were in a little family owned place in NY. Not very Vegan friendly, it's not what it set out to be so that's fair.",1.0

"Okay guys i have been here about fivetimes now ( i live right by it ) so i believe i can make an accurate review here , i have seen some mixed reviews and most negative reviews are a few years old. 

This place is 24\/7 for food which is fantastic and it has a good reasonably priced menu! A plus is all food is served any time day or night regardless of what type of meal you want. Lets start with breakfast, I had the three egg cheese omelet which was great it came with hash browns and toast. Everything was great , for toast I got some of the best marble rye bread I've had in quite some time so i definetly reccomend breakfast and if I remember correctly my food was only about $6-$7 dollars! 

Now to lunch and dinner, i am a huge fan of their FULL sized potatoe skins ! They are big if you didnt get the hint when i said full size lol. Crispy on the outside and cooked properly so the potatoe is nice and soft which is very important, plenty of melted cheddar cheese , bacon , and chives . This is one of their best appetizers I've had their and some of the best potatoe skins I've had anywhere. 
Moving on to the entrée its hard to go wrong, I've had their burgers which are made with quality meat and always good . Cheesy potatoe soup is fantastic and even better if you get it in a bread bowl. I also had a shepherds pie there which wasnt bad, i didnt like one of the spices in it cant put my finger on what it was maybe cloves not sure but please dont take it as it being bad it was just my personal taste and the other people with me loved it! As far as sides fries are fresh and always golden brown and one of my favs is their potatoe salad which was very good as well and I do recommend .

Now for service and ambience. My favorite waitress is danny she is funny and very attentive she is usually there breakfast and lunch. I have had other waitresses that are not the best in the evening but nothing for me to complain about i got my orders in quick no matter what time a day and they all made sure my cups were full. 
The bar and restaurant itself never seems to be too busy which puzzles me for the quality food they have, you can seat yourself anywhere and they have great private areas if you wanna have a party or a bunch of friends or whatever, overall I really like this place and highly reccomend it because the food here is not your typical bar food so please enjoy and if you get danny for a waitress tell her Big Mike sent you !",1.0
"Nail time is thee best time lol...

I've been going to CC Nails for about a year now.  I love it's location.  It's in the same plaza as BJ's and Twin Peaks; so it's great to grab a bite or a beer right after you get your nails done.   

I usually come here for pedis, and I love getting them done by Kim.  She knows how to shape nails really well, and she treats my cuticles ever so gently.  They're practices look pretty clean, however, I've never really asked; but I've seen them clean the bowls and tools after every usage, which is nice.  Treatments are fairly priced. Can't wait til my next pedi!

Come in on Mondays-Wednesdays before 12pm(?) for their ""nail happy hour"" and get 20% off your bill!",1.0
"Went there on grand opening day at 6:00 pm and was busy as can be and it only got worst by 6:30 pm with the parking lot and drive thru in gridlock. 

Chicken stripes as fresh as can be. We shared the Caniac Combo, substituted the slaw and got extra french fries. The chicken is always consistent, fresh white meat. I am a dark meat person would love for Raising Canes to offer dark chicken meat sometime in the future,  but their white meat is juicy and not dry.

The biggest tip is you have to get their lemonade which is awesome! 

The strangest tip would be if you are an ice chewer,  they have the best ice with their drinks. The ice is perfect for chewing since it is soft and will not break all your teeth.

The service is quick and the people are very helpful and make you feel welcome.

"Szmidt's is amazing. The sandwiches are just wonderful.

It reminds me of a Katz Deli from NYC. These guys make their cured meats in house.

I typically get the corned beef, hence the comparison to Katz.  Szmidt's is better. Katz and company put that giant pile of meat on the bread. Szmidt's is a nice healthy balance. I don't feel like a pig.

While there, get the pierogies. Very few places make pierogies in house. These guys do. House made pierogies are awesome.",1.0

This is an amazing place. Great food and and great vibe. Friendly staff and cool decor. The food has a very flavorful and fresh taste. We took our food to go. The food traveled well. The authentic taste and fresh ingredients were a pleasant and most refreshing take on tacos. I will be coming back for more.,1.0
"Pizza Studio is a great addition to the 'build your own\/unlimited topping pizza' movement that seems to be sweeping Phoenix (or maybe the country... or maybe the WORLD!). The service here was great, very friendly and helpful. The concept (like many others in town) is you choose your crust, sauce, cheese, and toppings on your own personal pizza (11 inch thin crust). They have many options and seemingly limitless combos you can make. I had the rosemary herb crust with tomato and pesto sauces, mozz and goat cheese, garlic, tomatoes, roasted onion, roasted zucchini, bacon, basil, and arugula. It was extremely tasty and delivered to my table within 5 minutes. Also, it only cost 8$... and I brought half home... so a pretty great deal. How does it compare to other build your own joints in town? I would say much better than Fired Pie (both in flavor and selection) but not as good as My Pie (the one owned by Crust) which I thought had better overall flavor and gets points for being locally owned. Now, I would probably frequent Studio more than My Pie based on proximity to me. Regardless, if you're in the downtown area and feel like some quality personal pizza (and not some crappy Totino's), head to Pizza Studio!

"Not enough good words to describe this place. Let's start with the coconut martini, phenomenology. I could drink this forever, I also had the ouster shots, loved them. 
But the best thing, the Manhattan. Wow wow wow. O words, expertly created to perfection, everything about it is amazing. It tastes better as you drink more if it. The melody of tastes that you experience are indescribable. I know it's pricey but you have to try it. I already miss the taste.",1.0
"When we arrived at the restaurant they told us it would be a few minutes before our table was ready and we could wait at the bar. No problem. My husband and I ordered drinks and once our table was ready the hostess notified us and was ready to show us to our table. However, she made no offer to have our drinks brought to our table. Not that I was expecting HER to do it but she could've had someone else do it. It's awkward when you're at the bar, have your purse in tow, jacket on and have to carry a martini glass wearing heels to your table. That's my only gripe :)

Food and service thereafter was great. The best thing about this place is that they are completely fine with you splitting an entree. We shared the lobster bisque which they offered to split for us which was great! We then shared the rib eye which was cooked perfectly medium rare and ordered the risotto as a side. The food was really tasty and just the right amount without being overly stuffed. Our waiter and staff were all very good. The waiter even put a rush in for our food since we had a show to catch. Very nice of him.",1.0

I have been going there for many years now and always get a great massage. Normally it don't have to wait or they will tell me when to come back so I don't waste time. They will tell me to come back in 10 or 15 minutes and then they will be ready for me.,1.0
This was a fantistic restaurant in the Luxor.  I was a little leary about eating here.  We were seated right away.  Both waiters made us feel welcome.  They pointed out everything we needed to know.

"There's a swanky, late-night, Rat Pack-era, cosmopolitan charm to Central Diner & Grille that has no parallel in the Pittsburgh area. Men and women from the service industry dressed in suits, ties, and other such formal attire dined alongside my loose band of rapscallion metalheads after a concert at Altar Bar. The manager could be see waiting on patrons sans a tie, indicating a hectic night handled with grace and class after 12am. 

My insane friends decided it would be a good idea to go there for pie and milkshakes, braving a potential winterstorm. 

The snow didn't start falling until well into the morning, but most of my friends had their pie and milkshakes...together. 

You see, my friends had their pies (and in one case, cheesecake) blended into their milkshakes with no crosseyed looks. Their requests were accommodated famously by Alexander, our affable server. 

When one pal went against the peer pressure and ordered a roast beef dinner, Alex asked, ""You want that in a milkshake too?"" The man had a sense of humor.

The scratch-made mastery was also apparent in the dark fortress that was their brownie sundae. The brownies themselves were as dense as a candy bars and had a crisp tuille-ish exterior. Topping it were globes of golden vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, walnuts, Oreo scraps, and chocolate chips.

We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by Tamia (hope I spelled her name correctly).  She was attentive and very friendly throughout our somewhat lengthy stay there.  Drinks were great and the hamburgers each if us had were fantastic.  Very tasty, cooked perfectly and massive.  Of course after the burgers of course we had to try the milkshakes.  Yummy!

"This place just opened right across the street from my house which is awesome (or terrible for my health).  They are next to a small gym too so I supposed you could have a pastry then work it off right after ;) They just opened a week or so ago so their selection is currently a little limited but what they had there appeared of high quality, including a selection of pastries, fresh breads (including french baguettes), cookies, and quiche.  They said they would start to offer a couple of sandwiches soon too and they also had brewed coffee (but no espresso options I could see). There is a small seating area available inside.  The person who helped me (maybe the owner?) was very friendly and happy to tell me about all his offerings and they had a couple things out to sample.  I'd probably give them 4 stars for the limited offerings but since they just opened and are working on expanding I'll give them 5 stars for now and I'll definitely be checking back later!",1.0

We had calamari and meatballs as an appetizer.  I could have made a meal on the appetizer.  Our entrees were superb.  We got to know the owner and had a lot of fun.  An added bonus was bringing our own wine which we wanted to drink for a minimal surcharge fee.  This is a new restaurant and I am afraid when more people hear about this place it will be hard to get in.  Right now it is a hidden secret, so I am going to make the drive quite often.

When it comes to your kids you have to know that whoever is treating them is your childs advocate.  They have to care.  I have a child who has CP and I need to know that his doctor is in his corner, helping me to make sure he is getting the services and care that he needs.  They have been there with me making sure he gets in to see the right specialist and then some.  I have several friends who take their kids to Healing Hearts.

Garlic naan are apparently standard, not something you have to pay extra for, because they were waiting at my table by the time I came back from the buffet. The service was excellent too.

"Went to Main event for the second time on Sunday. We tried to take the kids there on Saturday evening but it was so packed that we didn't think the unlimited laser tag, bowling, billboards and gravity ropes would be worth it. We came on Sunday afternoon instead. It was a good move as it wasn't too crowded. The deal was $15.95\/person from 12-4 pm. We got there at 1 and went straight into a 15 minute game of laser tag. When it was over we went to sign up for another round. Since it wasn't super busy the girl at the counter signed us up for three straight rounds. It was really cool as we didn't even have to take off the gear for 45 minutes. All in all, we played 5 rounds of laser tag and a bunch of video games. The kids had a blast. Tons of fun. Didn't bowl or anything else this trip because the laser tag is what the kids wanted to do. However, when we arrived it looked like there were plenty of lanes available. It was definitely more crowded as you got closer to 4pm. Will be back.",1.0

Location is a bit out of my way, but definitely worth the visit. Will be coming back definitely.",1.0
I had such a good visit here. The entire staff was very friendly and they explained everything that was going on and always asked if I had questions.  Doctor Brown was excellent and very friendly as well.  They went over all the details of my dental work and everything my insurance will and won't cover. I will definitely be going back for further cleaning and recommend to friends and family.,1.0
"How come I lived here for almost 2 decades and nobody told me there was a great BBQ place right up the street?  Ribs were great.  I loved the potato salad and baked beans.  The pulled pork was also really good.  No frills.  No bathroom for example, but if you don't mind sitting outside on comfortable, clean picnic tables no problem.  Seriously this is the most hidden BBQ joint in town.  If somebody doesn't tell you how to get there, forget it.  Of course with smart phones and the address above that's not problem.  Prices are about average for real barbecue meats and quite good for the generous sides.",1.0
"Step 1) I checked Yelp and went to shop.

Step 2) I walked in and told them our phone wasn't working. They took a peek and the problem was diagnosed in under 5 mins. 

Step 3) They quoted a reasonable price and the were able to fix it on the spot! 

Step 4) 15 mins later... The phone was fixed and we were on our way. 

I was super pleased with the service and pricing. They offer a tiny bit of a discount for cash vs card (I'm not a fan of using cash. So, I only knocked em' one star. If you like cash then move my review up to five stars). Regardless, I'm very happy and I would stop here again for any future iPhone issue.",1.0
"I stumbled across Vapers on Bloor about a week ago. I live in the neighborhood and was THRILLED when I saw that we finally have a Vape shot in the West End., located right at the Lansdowne Subway station. 

 For those of you who are new to this, it's an e-cigarette shop that provides all you need to make the switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes. People that use e-cigs refer to their e-emoking as 'vaping' so when you see the term vape or vaping, that's what they are talking about. The reason is that you are inhaling  a vaporized nicotine liquid made of a nicotine based e-liquid as opposed to tobacco and all of the nasty chemicals that go along with that. This means that you can say goodbye  to the nasty smell (and taste) of traditional cigarettes which still getting a pleasurable taste as well as nicotine if you should choose to. The juices are available with or without nicotine and many people start out with nicotine but end up cutting their nicotine content down as they become accustomed to vaping. In regards to flavours, there are over 40 available (and counting ) and that's where it gets very interesting. The tastes are as varied as Strawberry Shortcake to Chocolate mint and eveything in between. Die hard cigarette smokers need not worry however as there are several flavours what are just nicotine based as well and taste just like traditional cigarettes. I was a die hard traditional cigarette smoker and I now love to try out the different flavours available. 

The store itself is beautiful. It has the look of an old fashional apocathery with beautiful furnishings and lighting making the customer feel like they have stepped back in time to a tradtional vintage department store counter complete with the friendly service that is so often missing these days in today's stopping experience. The vaping scene takes a bit of getting used to and there is a learning curve to be sure. Knowing what type of battery and cartomizer to choose can be a little intimidating. The owner, Balazs and his staff are so patient and happy to take their time explaining all of the options and letting you try the various flavours available. Testers of ALL flavours are available and they will let you try as many as you like with no pressure or rush. You can just take a seat and choose what you want to try from the large blackboard sign that's updated with all of the lflavour instock . In one week, I have been back twice choosing the Rich Vanilla and hte Parisian Cafe flavours as well as an Arise cartomizer. I am VERY happy with my  purchases and am looking forward to returning to try more flavours soon.. Balazs has infomred me that he attended the VapeCan conference this past weekend here in Toronto and will have new flavours available at the end of the week.

 Its hard to imagine even more flavours available considering how many he already has for sale. In closing I cannot recommend this new vape shop highly enough. It's about time the West end had a vape shop but to get one of this calibre and qualtiy with an owner who clearly strives to provide a top quality experience is a dream come true. Stop by - you'll be glad you did.. This is ny one and only choice for all of my vaping supplise from now on.",1.0
"I have had my car detailed with the mini detail twice in the past year. They do a spectacular job and all of the employees are very courteous. I would give them 5 stars but....

They are difficult to reach, as many of the reviews on Yelp mention. If you leave a message, they don't call you back for days.That is the only drawback I found. If you can wait for them to call you back, you won't be disappointed. But they really do need to get that one aspect of their customer service figured out pronto.

Still, I would recommend them or have them detail my car again any day if I'm not in a hurry for them to get back to me.",1.0
So this place is awesome. The food here is great. I get the Philly each time I go here and have never been disappointed. The star rating would be a 5 but the price (over 8 bucks for a sandwich) got it 4 stars. Don't get me wrong the food is awesome even for the price. The service is also friendly and nice. The staff greets you quickly and your food arrives on fast and hot.,1.0
"I should say up front that I HATE car dealerships.  However, Midway Nissan was great from the front end through the back end of the process.  Aside from some mixed signals between the front office and the finance department (regarding how many years of free oil changes and tire rotations you get from the dealership - 2 years) the process was smooth sailing.  One improvement - ALL DEALERS ARE SLOW AS MOLASSES to move you from sale to finance.  Even though I think we were out of there in 8 hours (arrived at 1:30 and departed by 9:30 PM), there has to be a better way to speed up that process between ""yes"" and signing.  Not particularly a Midway issue but if some dealership can get the navigation from front door through closing right, I would be a fan for life.  

Righ now, I will be back at Midway Nissan for our next vehicle.  That says a LOT.",1.0
"Travel a few off the beaten path or strip if you will, and you will find burger greatness. I ate many a heart attacks especially when they note grass fed or Kobe and for some reason they just don't measure up. Bachi on the other hand has created magic. The flavors just meld together wonderfully. Most notable were the Kiki burger and the pork belly thingy in the bun, oh wait, and the oxtail fries. The Kiki burger blew away the kalbi burger in terms of transcending flavors bursting in your mouth. People love in n out, fat burgers, smash burgers, but they're just burgers. If you are looking for burger perfection you need to go to bachi.",1.0

"Loved my first meal of Salud!   Will definitely be back.  Delicious rice and beans and plantains.  They include those 3 sides with the meal and the coffee is delicious.   I ordered the pork belly wraps and was happy with them, but thought it was maybe a little skimpy on the portion size.  The owner and his staff were very accommodating for my toddler son, which I really appreciated.",1.0
Loved the fresh coconut bars!! Every bite had chunks of fresh coconut. Very unique flavors to try!,1.0
"I was wowed by the food and ambiance. First of all I love that they text you when your table is ready so you can gamble at a nearby casino while you wait. It's a fun, casual environment. It's quite loud, which I liked, and they played music videos for the diners to enjoy. If you want to enjoy a quiet dinner, this is NOT the spot for you! Very fun for 20-30 somethings and I assume that is their target audience as most of the music videos were from the 90's. As for the food, the pizza is amazing. We ordered the Downtown pizza (good for 2-3 people) and it's the perfect style for people who liked everything on their pizza. Love the premium toppings! Yummy and great prices!",1.0
"I'm giving them five stars because, for a new place, they have a lot of the right stuff going on right from the start. Mainly the service - the hostess greeted us instantly and with a great attitude, sat us down immediately, and our server Scotty was wonderfully friendly and did a great job. This was the first time here for my wife and me, and she doesn't normally like BBQ, but *I* do, so she got the Big Cobb Salad and loved it, while I got the ""Go Hog Wild"" combo plate, and I was happy too. The sweet tea was just right, as well. An earlier review said the food comes out less than piping hot, and that's true, so don't dawdle taking pictures of your chow, start eating, and you'll be fine. Big portions, all done well. The pulled pork with the Q3 sauce was my favorite, but everything was very good. Beautiful atmosphere and the aforementioned friendly staff will have us back again soon.",1.0
"Yum!!! We love a non chain place.  Very friendly owner. Highly recommend chicken ranch specially pizza.  Tons of chicken, cheese and red hot!  The crust was ridiculous!

"Had a good meal here, though they did give me some slight attitude for coming in 20 mins before closing- OK, I get it, you want to go home- but then, just close earlier? I asked you if you were open, once you decide you want my money, then serve me right. That being said, food was good, and didn't take long to come out. I had the butter chicken (very good), rice (so-so) and onion kulcha (excellent). Worth going back and trying some different food.",1.0

"My boyfriend and I went here for dinner Sunday evening at the Tasting Room on Wilson where their food truck was set up.  After hearing great things about their food and seeing the delicious looking photos, we decided to give it a try! 

The prices are very affordable here, which honestly surprised me.  I ordered the Aioli Burger with fries and my boyfriend ordered the White Truffle Burger.  After we each took the first bite (while still chewing) the first thing we both said was ""oh my god, this is so good."" These burgers were as mouth watering as their photos.  Incredibly juicy and tender with obviously fresh ingredients.  My salted fries came served with both a home made ketchup and a garlic dipping sauce; I wanted to just drink them by themselves, that's how good they are!  Every aspect of our meal was amazing and we are so glad that we found this gem.

I keep track of their calendar to see when they will be around our neck of the woods so I can grab another Aioli Burger (see ya 4\/17!!).  Wish I could have one right this second! I highly recommend this food truck; you will not be disappointed.",1.0
Kind of an awkward location that doesn't give you the vibe that your out for a drink. Great menu and very cheap drinks for happy hour. Great place to just come here and watch sports or socialize with friends. The atmosphere however seems like a place for the older crowd. I love the Gilroy pizza.,1.0
"A bit on the pricey side but their cheese curds are excellent and they do a nice ""roll the dice"" drink special. Pick your choice of liquor (you can specify if you prefer sweet, fruity, dry style of drink) and the bartender will craft you something totally random!

"Impressive. Breathtaking. Elegant. Classy. No woman would want to compete with that but the Wrigley Mansion will share the spotlight with you. It renders a time of such sophistication and beauty that should be bottled up. The grounds are meticulously maintained and food is wonderfully crafted. Service and staff are just stellar. Trust me, after a few drinks, you wish you could slip into your PJs and go upstairs. They leave you feeling like you're home. I can't believe people complain about valet. Hand over the $5 unless you want to work up an appetite or show off your calves climbing uphill, your date would not appreciate it in heels. And by the time you make it up to the top, you might miss the gorgeous sunset views. 

I love coming here for the champagne brunch alone. How many ways can I have my eggs!!! Everything is exceptional from eggs benedict, french toast to simply the fruit selection. It truly is an experience any native Phoenician should partake and certainly a way to seduce our visitors to fall in love with the desert. I recently spent my birthday celebration here and that was yet another lovely and memorable experience. Having drinks at Geordie's alone will leave you imprinted with a fantastic smile. With that said, don't come here if you want a cheap run-of-the-mill buffet. Stop over at Denny's or at the local diner. It isn't something you do every day. Much like fairy tales, they happen and are far in between, but the memory lasts a lifetime. Everyone deserves to be swept off their feet and the Wrigley Mansion will be your Prince Charming.",1.0

"I'm not sure if Soyo is actually a ""Vegas staple"", but it's definitely a Vegas staple for me since it's one of the first places I ate at when I first moved here and keep on coming back to. Located in an unassuming strip mall (same as Oyshi), Soyo serves up Korean ""bar"" food late into the night. I've eaten in the patio, in the ""upstairs"" area with a large group, in the booths, and in the picnic tables in the main floor. The place isn't huge, but they definitely try to use up as much space as possible. My favorite dishes are the garlic chicken wings, tofu soup and corn cheese. The ban chan choices here change periodically - just last night, they had a side dish of this really tender, marinated beef that was really mouth-watering. They do get really busy here, so at times there can be a long wait. I've seen so many different types of people here, which I think goes to show that Soyo is a crowd pleaser. Just last night, I saw the parents of two newborns dining here, so you know the food must be good if they're willing to go out of their way to eat here. They give you barley tea in a tin bowl as soon as you are seated, but hot tea and iced water are available as well. I'm not as big of a fan of the Soju (prefer places in SF more), but this place is a solid Korean option on Westside. I always joke and say ""Mashisoyo"" (another Korean restaurant) must mean ""not as good as Soyo"" since this place is so much better than the the former.",1.0

"It's actually pretty good for how inexpensive the prices were. Although they do not have a large menu, they had a good range of selections. Walking along the strip or even driving by it, you could easily miss it. It's in a marketplace of restaurants and vendors close to Polo Towers and the Travelodge.

After eating finely the two days prior on the Las Vegas Strip, we decided as a group to stroll the marketplace (which was steps away from our hotel --the Polo Towers) and see what we wanted to eat that wouldn't cost a lot, and couldn't drive anyway because none of us could legally do that at the time, if you catch my drift.

There weren't too many patrons inside so service wasn't slow for us. There's a good number of tables and seats here as well as a wall mural of photos depicting food around the world.

We were out of there in 15mins and didn't feel rushed...except that it was almost time for the Walking Dead episode to come on..

I ordered the miso ramen. I've had better noodles in San Diego but the broth was nice. No MSG present (I'm sensitive to MSG so I'll know), and really satisfies me.

The Salmon was grilled nicely and overall the dish was light and flavorful, just perfect!

The patty is cooked to perfection, it's juicy and thick,  the apple butter sauce goes well with everything, and the big buns soaks up all the sauces and extra juices so no messiness.

The 'Masala Burger' is not as heavy as ABB in terms of sauces, and has a curry taste to it. It's a bit spicy, and you also have an option of adding extra spicy sauce.

"Got a great deal on Vegas.com. Sat in the dead center just behind the sound control board. I've seen nearly every Cirque show in Vegas and decided to have a date night for my final night in Sin City and check this show out. It was unique - as all Cirque shows are. I would say it's more of a cabaret show than Cirque if I'm being honest. It's good, a little strange but there's some very interesting audience interaction that is worth a laugh or two. The reviews that said it made the viewers ""randy"" confused me. While this is the sexual side of Cirque, it wasn't enough to make us want to run back to the room. I suppose if 50 Shades of Grey does it for you this will too. Both were a little over-hyped on the ""oh so sexual you must be done immediately"" end of the spectrum for me.

Beautiful presentation and very delightful service and food. The owner hand makes all the menus in English and in Japanese. 

They have different price ranges that are higher but this special price ($30) is only available this December.

"I have been dining at Del's with varying regularity for over forty years, less often now since I moved to the suburbs from the city of Pittsburgh. I fondly remember going there late at night for the best mushroom omelette I have ever had, all of $2.75 with lots of french fries: you can tell how long ago this was!  The food is still great and the dining room looks much better and is more comfortable than it was in the past.  I was shocked to be able to walk in and secure a choice table in the most desriable room on a Friday night at the height of the dinner hour.  In a room that seats scores of people, it was just me, my wife, and another party of two!  Unless this was a most unusual night in which no one chose to dine out, I must conclude that Del's has gotten ahead of itself with its high prices.  This is no longer the ""neighborhood spaghetti joint"", but a place that charges $10 for appetizers and $10 for a wedge lettuce salad!  My wife and I enjoyed the $10 fried zucchini and a large white pizza with mushrooms ($15) (Del's mushrooms are the very best!).  If there is any fairly-priced item on the menu, it is the pizzas, which have not followed the other items with consistent price hikes.  We enjoyed our meal thoroughly, but we would not come here to spend more than $20 on an entree.  I hope that this 65-year-old Bloomfield institution is not pricing itself out of business!  The owners should remember that there is a huge amount of competition for the dining dollar today!",1.0

"I've been extremely pleased working with Jeremy and The House Team for my lending needs, including a streamline refinance and purchase of a new home.

When we looked at refinancing our last house a little over a year ago, I had talked to a few lenders that would either take forever to respond to my questions or never made me feel comfortable about the process. After just an hour of getting him my information, Jeremy was able to show me how much I would save by refinancing and immediately answered all of my questions. It was a no brainer for me at that point. Jeremy and The House Team requested the remaining information they needed and then executed my refinance quickly and efficiently.

Then less than a year later, we we considering buying a new house but weren't sure about market conditions or the rules about buying after recently refinancing.  Jeremy answered all of my questions and then some.  He put us at ease and we started the home buying process.  There were a few hiccups along the way related to the appraisal, but Jeremy was on top of it.  Despite these hiccups, The House Team had our loan ready to close early.  We decided to keep our close date, but with all the stories you hear about people not closing on time, just knowing things were all set for us was a great feeling.

They were very thorough in the process of understanding the room where the tie will be in, usage for the tile, and overall feel of the house.

There follow through process of letting me know when the tile will arrive, if I received everything undamaged, and if I need to place an order for some follow-on pieces was exceptional customer service and something I never received from any other tile or designer store.

They are definitely not a big box store like Lowes, Home Depot, or Arizona Tile. Craftsman Court is unique, one of a kind tile, from all of the world.

I had such a wonderful time eating at Joe Vicari's.  The restaurant instantly makes you feel at home and relaxed, far away from any craziness downstairs in the casino.

We ordered one of the best tasting Meat Balls I have ever had.  The meat ball was huge, juicy and delicious.  The two of us had a hard time finishing it due to the size - we were also worried that we had two large steaks coming, so we had to stop.

We ordered a bottle of Caymus from their very nice wine list.  -The prices were better than any restaurant I have been to in Las Vegas.  The waiter professionally opened the bottle for us, and left us to enjoy the ambiance.  

Once our main course arrived, we knew we made the right decision to stop before we finished the meat ball.  My Rib Eye Steak was enough for two people and was cooked flawlessly!  We also had a beautifully cooked New York Steak to share with a side of Truffled Mashed Potatoes to put the meal over the top.

"Went to watch The Hobbit in 3D full recliner. Sat in the back corner giving you even more ample space and no one else in front of you. Definitely recommend that area. 

Food was meh, pretty much standard movie fare. Cost around $50 for two mains, one app and a drink. Apparently youre to tip when you pay for your food and not at the end (kind of weird but okay). 

The seats don't fully recline back but more of a slant. Still very nice and a lot of wiggle room. Middle arm rest goes up. They have those airplane trays for you to put your food.

We visited this small little gem last night and were impressed with the friendliness of the staff as well as the quaintness of the arcade. If you're a fan of pinball machines, this place is worth a visit! I was hooked on the ""Bow and Arrow"" classic pinball machine while the mister bounced around from machine to machine. While there are mostly pinball machines, there are a couple of classic arcade games too: Donkey Kong, Dig Dug and Popeye among a few.

There were a few machines out of order but the ones that were on worked spot on. Besides, all of the games are on FREE PLAY so you really can't gripe too much ;) Because all of the games are on Free Play, it's good karma to make a kind donation on your way out  :)

Flipperspiel Wunderland is a great place to me just for the nostalgia factor. It takes me back to the days of feeling like I ruled the friendly neighborhood arcade with a fistful of change.

"I was a die-hard Cibo fan when it came to pizza in the Phoenix area, but now it's a tough call! La Bocca was cute - not as intimate and hipstery as Cibo - more cozy and trendy. The wine list was amazing, and there was also a decent selection of beers on tap. If you're just planning on going out for drinks and appetizers with a small group, I recommend sitting in the ""lounge areas"" so you don't have to wait.
My bf and I went for dinner, and our server was great. She was very attentive and made excellent suggestions. We got the antipasti plate for a starter. Everything was tremendous, but the highlights were the prosciutto-wrapped goat cheese and the house pesto spread. Both fantastic and unique! For our main course, I ordered the smoked prosciutto Alfredo (which had orange zest that truly took it to the next level!) and my boyfriend ordered a build your own pizza. We shared our meals; the portions weren't HUGE but we had enough leftover for one lunch the next day. Finally, we couldn't resist getting the chocolate chip cookie for dessert. We shared, but it was small enough for one sugar-craving individual :)

I like that you can view the dogs in day camp through the big window and watch how your dog interacts with the other dogs. I like that they offer a treat time for an additional fee so that the dogs get a snack while they are there. I love picking my dog up and getting the ""pawgress report"" to see how he did for the day. Employees also point out which dogs my dog interacted with and played with during the day.

"My car buying experience at Centennial Toyota was surprisingly painless, maybe even pleasant (that's saying a lot for a car dealership!). I found the vehicle I wanted online and emailed them about it, asking for an 'out the door' price (total with taxes\/fees). They responded quickly and were very straightforward, giving me the exact cost the car would cost me to the cent. They sent me a couple emails after that over the next week, but nothing too aggressive and no ridiculous daily sales calls like many dealerships do (looking at you, Auto Nation Nissan). When I finally went in to buy it, my salesman Ramone was very friendly and again, straightforward. I knew what I wanted and he knew I wanted it so he didn't try to upsell me on something stupid or pressure me into anything different. The finance guy tried to sell me on extended warranties and other extras I didn't want or need, as I expected. However, he was polite when I turned them down and didn't go all aggro-salesman on me like so many do. After coming back 2 days later with a check for the quoted amount (the exact amount they quoted me in our initial email exchange), I got my truck. The truck was clean, had a full tank of gas, in great shape and with no more miles on it than when I had finished test driving it. Ramone sat with me for a while, explaining the interior, bluetooth system, some details about Toyotacare, and other pertinent things. I then drove off with my lovely new truck. I've had a few questions since then about registration and titles and Ramone was quick to respond over email even after having sold me the truck (this, quite frankly, was amazing... too many places you fall through the cracks after you actually purchase the vehicle and it seems like they stop caring about you after that point). The green slip for registering my vehicle was available in half the time they estimated it would be and I had the truck registered\/plated within 4 days of buying it. All in all, these guys were polite, straightforward, and helpful.",1.0

Basically id recommend this place to anyone and everyone. I even took some business cards for my purse to pass out.

"I moved into my house 2 years ago and had to buy a new refrigerator... Well, due to the hot summer, we go through a lot of ice. My ice machine broke and it had to be replaced... Wouldn't you know, as soon as the warranty has expired something happens! Being new to the Phoenix area, I wasn't sure who to call, so I got on Yelp! I got 3 estimates for a new ice maker and Hillside was the best price overall! Leonard was very professional and a good communicator... I will definitely call this company again if I ever need anything repaired!",1.0
"When New Orleanians vacation elsewhere, it's important for us to know the best bars in the city that we're visiting.  There's research and what not...we take our cocktails serious.

Le Lab definitely did not disappoint!!  I was pleasantly shocked that the staff was so friendly, since snobby\/rude bartenders are apparently the cool thing at craft cocktail bars in the US right now.  Eddy and Fabien are extremely knowledgeable and love to talk about their craft.  The drink menu was extensive and had a nice selection of summer cocktails....and any place that carries sazerac and can make a top-notch Corpse Reviver #2 wins in my book!!!  They also make their own syrups which are for sale to the public...try the ginger, it's the best!

We decided to order 3 appetizers, as it was early in the evening and a full meal didn't appeal to either myself or my husband. Good choice! We loved all three things that we ordered: lamb skewers, flatbread with lamb and feta cheese and finally, stuffed mushrooms with crabmeat and spinach. Delish!!

Loved the outdoor dining option. A lovely courtyard with flowers and privacy from the parking lot....something you don't find too often in a ""mall"" restaurant.

But went there last night and it is still great!  Love the cheap tables.  They had a band.  Beer pong going on...really was impressed.  It is totally super casual, kinda ""frat"" like, but just great for us locals who don't want to dress up to go out.  Stick with beer if you are on a budget.  Great place to chill and enjoy the atmosphere while gambling and drinking.",1.0
Great king crab at a reasonable price. Try the Trifecta sauce with a 3 on the spice scale. Its has a bite! Great service by Autumn and the only thing you could add would be a view of the ocean.,1.0
"I love this Second Cup ! 

 I used to live in the area and would drop by several times a week for coffee.
 And I'd often go out of my way just to pick up one of their deliciously rich date squares or a slice of lemon poppy seed loaf - probably more often than I should have. 

 The people who ran this particular Second Cup were friendly and professional and attentive.  Whoever was behind the counter always made me feel right at home.  

I don't live nearby any more, but whenever I am at Yonge and Eglinton this is my go-to destination.  
Now I bring my grandson who enjoys looking out the window at the trucks and buses rumbling down Yonge Street while he munches on a blueberry muffin or dips into a peach yogurt and I sip my coffee.  
And now there are many gluten-free goodies to distract me from not being able to have those date squares or lemon loaves any more.
 
The staff are as friendly and professional and attentive as I remember, and they always make us feel right at home.

Clean, comfortable, consistent - a cafe I trust.

"After my initial visit, I only praised the gelato at Old School Pizzeria. My first review is now obsolete because they no longer offer gelato. I've been back twice, and I still haven't had a memorable pizza experience, but I really enjoyed the rosemary garlic knots and side salad with mascarpone ranch dressing on my most recent visit. I was impressed by these items so I also ordered a cannoli to go. The crisp, homemade shell was filled to order with a light cinnamon-spiced ricotta cream and dusted with powdered sugar. With each bite, I was also dusted with powdered sugar. I'm sure that I will think of this simple, delicious dessert any time I find myself on this side of Craig Road.

They have also made some improvements to the dining area to make it more attractive. It's still a comfortable place to eat with children, as the chalkboard walls are a welcome distraction until your pizza comes out of the oven.",1.0
"Fresh and tasty! We got the bacon wrapped okra and spicy wonton to start, then shared the shrimp papaya salad and chicken pad thai for dinner. The portions were generous, and had just the right amount of kick. We finished our meal with the green tea cheesecake, which was light and sweet. Everything was delicious! This is a great go-to spot for late night eats.",1.0
"We were on our way from MD to Hilton Head. I have made it a point to visit BBQ on road trips. The reason we chose Bills's was because it all homemade and the unique yellow slaw (mustard & vinegar base). For us, to experience authentic NC pulled pork BBQ (they cook the whole pig:) with the yellow slaw combo was the best part. Followed by the amazing banana pudding, which is a must. Bill's is as close to walking back in time as anyone can hope for. Expect fast pace, plastic cups and lots of napkins.",1.0

AZ 88 is a trendy looking place in the Scottsdale Civic Center Park with patio seating right next to an immaculate lawn and enchanting promenade.

The menu is chick-heavy and full of unique takes on classic offerings. I tried the Elsa's chicken sandwich and was not disappointed with the soy-ginger dragon sauce. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken salad and we split a salmon and cream cheese on potato chips appetizer. Like I said before, enjoyable experience overall and I'm definitely planning on going back to try the other offerings on the menu.",1.0

Drink service is usually better here than in the Flamingo, most likely due to it's smaller size. Dealers and cocktail waitresses have always been nice and very friendly. While you're there stop by the total rewards desk and get yourself a Margaritaville card, your home casino will be jealous of how cool it is!

"The tacos here are delicious! They are bigger than what you are used to if you get tacos from a truck! It is twice the size of that. I have tried the chicken and carne asada tacos and both were able to satisfy my hunger at the moment. The chicken tacos were okay.. it could have had more of that grilled taste, but nonetheless, I would eat it again. The carne asada tacos were my favorite! It was filled with a lot of meat and toppings on top! At the restaurant, they have a few sauces in bottles. Its fun to just try a whole bunch of sauces, but be careful if you do not like a lot of spice! The bottles are just red and green and you do not know what the spice levels are!

My favorite dish from this place that I crave all the time like a pregnant woman (i'm not expecting, however.. I just love this dish that much...) is the CEVICHE!!!! Their shrimp is made perfectly and it is so juicy with the sauces they put on top! It is dry-- not your typical wet ceviche but for sure.. THIS IS A MUST TRY dish! It is so addicting. It does not come with a lot of chips so make sure you ask for extra on the side.

I didn't have any issues with the food today... Just that the server did not pay attention to my request when I ordered. I didn't want the fried fish. Only the fresh grill and blackened. But I still ended up with the fried fish in one of my tacos.

"How do you rate an inconsistent restaurant? I have to give a:

- 5 to the fried chicken (KBC): expensive but can feed at least two people. It is 2 legs and 2 bone-in, breast pieces. Plus Banchan (7 types of pickles) and white rice. I shared it with 2 friends and could have stopped eating after that.

- 4 to the general tso chicken livers and thighs. I really liked it. It is a huge plate of fried meat, so not the lightest, brightest dish you can imagine, but it is perfectly crispy and the sauce had a perfect combination of sweet and spicy. The one thing I would do different is to cut the sweet breads smaller: as they are they are quite a mouthful

- 2 to the eggplant and tofu: limp, too sweet and undercooked (but might have been an unlucky batch I ordered them because I heard good things from some other friend)

- 2 to the soju flight: I really didn't care for any: chrisantemum was sweet, chili pepper was flavorless and liquorice one was way too medicinal, the plain soju was really not good soju

My friends had the bibimap and the ramen and they both complained. Apparently,  bibimap was too dense and ramen bland. I did not try them, so cannot elaborate further, but they seemed really disappointed.

I am inclined to be generous, because two of my dishes were good and I would definitely go back to have them, but

"This is a review for their food and delivery service.

I ordered their stuffed pasta pizza. Everything in it was spot on. It was not greasy, which is really common when it comes to pizza and especially with stuffed pies. It's a really thick crust that had a bit of sweet to it, something that I love in pizza. It reminds me of pizza from Northern NJ and New York City, where I'm originally from.
Now as for the chicken wings. They are among the best I've had. Again, it's not greasy even with the sauce on. The wings are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had the mild sauce and it was pretty spot on, just enough kick to it. 
Metro is a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum but you see it in the quality of the food you get. The delivery fee to my area was $3, which is average compared to all other delivery places. Really good service, had extra sauces for everything included. 
I have to say that Metro is worth the extra money for the quality of food you get.",1.0

Until then only almond and soy milks are offered as milk alternatives.",1.0
Heavenly ice cream. Had a scoop of the strawberry a couple of weeks ago and keep finding myself thinking about it. Mmm. It actually reduced my bf and I to silence.

One thing I can say is that the workers there are all very nice and pleasant. Andrew in particular is AMAZING! He always greets you with a big smile and a positive attitude.

In the end Iri settled for the Turkey Burger with Taro Frites! which left her speechless, it was love at first bite for her! lol... and as always she put the onion ring on my plate which I didnt think twice about devouring!

I on the other hand had their classic season beef burger with Taro frites as well. Juicy melt in your mouth hamburgesa indeed.
only thing I wished was for a lil bit more frites on my plate.  Though presentation was nice, the plate looked a bit empty, hence more frites, or some green parsley decor would have paid off a bit.

We walked in and everyone was super friendly. The bartender helped us decided what to order: we ended up getting the original and the dry rub wings, the chips and the cheese curds. The chips and cheese curds came out first and were great appetizers. They are coated in the same rub as the chicken; so even though the actual curds and chips weren't the best I've tried (in terms of texture\/factors besides seasoning); they were definitely tasty. Then the wings came and they were super yummy. I couldn't decide if I liked the original (saucy, kind of like buffalo wings) or the dry rub better so I had plenty of both. They went great with their original bleu cheese (apparently diluted with sour cream ""or something""), which apparently ""mama"" invented because bleu cheese was too expensive. 

I'm glad I went, but I'm not sure I agree that these are the best wings ever or even the best wings in town. Regardless, the food is very good and the experience is a hoot.",1.0

"My baristas at Dilworth in Belk are so amazing! They remembered my favorite two drinks at the sight of me or the mention of my name. Their coffee tastes nothing like any other coffee shops I've been to. 

The shop just got remodeled and it adds more character to the place. There are plenty of tables and a bar to sit at accompanied by free WiFi. 

The customer service is superb and so I don't mind tipping well. They have never been rude to me or any other customer when I've been in there. As a person who works with customers and clients I understand that good service is becoming increasingly hard to come by but you can get it here for sure.",1.0
"A must stop when I come to Vegas. A large menu that extends to many items also listed on their  wall. 

I recommend going to dinner and getting a reservation. It gets quite busy here and it's not that large.

Tonight we tried their chicken cutlet and drumstick, beef tongue with mushrooms, gomae, miso cod, unagi karage tempura and jalapeño fried rice. If you are into spicy food, definitely get the jalapeño fried rice.

Of course they are expensive they have prime rel estate on the strip it's a tourist trap but a yummy one at that.

You come for the experience and desserts which is what their biggest target market is. Definitely worth the trip.",1.0

"We started with half-dozen oysters, which were fat and flavorful. Our party ordered the ribeye, Kobe filet, and the ribcap. The ribeye was huge and the ribcap melts in your mouth. The filet was a good balance of fat and texture. Our sides were asparagus, creme corn, mac and cheese, and fingerling potatoes. We had one tough asparagus and the corn had a bit too much bourbon. Otherwise, the sides were good. For dessert, we had the toffee pudding cake and the peanut chocolate bar. The toffee date cake was as good as others have mentioned and the peanut chocolate bar was super rich. I think there should be complementary coffee for that dessert. The highlight of the meal was the staff. They were attentive, patient, and funny, without being overbearing. They made the meal all the more special. This was the evening of December 23, 2014.",1.0

"Every once in a while, I would indulge on a classy restaurant and I'm happy to say I picked a very good one with Roy's. No, I've never been in Hawaii, and yes, I like fish, so how can I not be tempted.

True to the word about Hawaiian hospitality, I felt welcome and accommodated by the staff throughout the entire meal. Bonus point for our waiter too for her recommendation and also for knowing her stuff about the ingredients on our dish. For our entrees, I had my fish and my companion had duck, Hawaiian-Asian fusion it is. Three delectable portion of fish meat called Roy's Classic Trio (mahi mahi, salmon, and butterfish) tastefully decked with rich sauces adorned my long three hollow plate. It goes with flavored rice, and whew, I can't even describe how heavenly it satisfies my palate. My friend's well done duck breast, contrary to the chef's recommended medium cooked, is texturally juicy. Prepare to spend on the mid-range price but every bite is worth it.

There were two dinner functions when we were there so the noise level was kind-a up, other than that, I think it is a cozy place for a date night. Will ask for a booth on my next visit and will definitely come back.",1.0

Their burritos are average - I mean, they are above-average for this area, but in general they are just okay. Kind of loosely wrapped, which is disappointing.
Chips and salsa are good.
Tacos seem fairly standard.
Perhaps the issue is that there is so much mediocre Mexican food around. I heard rave reviews about here, and have tried them a couple of times, but they are just good in my opinion. So, this is a local 4 (I'd rather have Huaraches) and if I'm judging it against legit Mexican in other areas of the country, it's probably a 3.",1.0

This is by far our most fave place to get pizza. We've been here dozens of times over the years. Their special salad with cheese and pepperoni with their own dressing is a great start before the pizza comes out. The only times we've had to wait a little longer to be served was when the place was completely busy. Again the waitstaff are usually attentive and offer drink refills to tide one over.  Love their crust dipped in ranch dressing - so good!,1.0

"Popped in here around 8:30 on a Thursday night for a night cap after dinning elsewhere. I was asked if we were having dinner and I explained that we were just going to have a drink. I was rather curtly informed that this is more of an eating place. I was kind of confused as I saw a lot of people just with cocktails. And I mean business is business and it wasn't THAT busy! My look must have said it all coupled with the fact that I was okay with sitting at the bar; the tune quickly changed. I was a little miffed at the reception, but he must have just been having a bad moment because from there on out he was lots of fun.

We had a couple glasses of prosecco and I tried a classic vodka martini a little on the dirty side. I didn't find it dirty, but it was a clean delicious cocktail with no hints of wateriness which ruins such a classic beauty.

I ordered the Rellenos and Eggs with green chile and my friend got the Pork Chop and Eggs.  We both loved our dishes and ate everything on the plate.  The Relleno peppers are filled with your choice of pork, beef or turkey.  I ordered the pork and beef and it had such a delicious smoky flavor to it, like it was slow cooked.

"When you walk into food peddler farm market the smells of fresh fruit greet you at the door, along with a friendly smile from the employees.

The store is laid out wonderfully. So organized and you can find everything you need without having to search the store. I enjoyed just walking around and looking at everything that they had to offer.

After talking with few happy friendly employees we decided to go to the deli first. Crystal the deli manager recommended the Cajun Turkey. I received a sample of it and the taste was just amazing. I was looking to buy buffalo chicken lunch meat but the Cajun Turkey suited me fine.

At the deli we bought the Cajun Turkey, smoked ham, salami and provolone cheese. Great prices on all of what we bought.

Then my husband decided talk to a few of the employees some which he knew while I went shopping. I started with getting a pineapple it seemed to call me when I got in the door. They had such fresh pineapples it was hard to find one to choose from.

I then decided to get some oranges, strawberries and grapes.

When my husband was done talking with the employees we shopped some more. We bought some nectarines and some plums and some lemons.

I noticed they had a jam shelf with a wide variety of jams. My favorite has always been strawberry so that is the one I bought. I have to say I ready need another jar it was so good I ate half the jar in one day. So fresh tasting it nearly melted in my mouth. Our son even thought it was the best jam too!

"My hungry partner and I tried this place on a whim, drawn in by the delicious-looking menus outside...and WOW am I glad we went in!! Ordered 3 types of dumplings and a green onion pancake. We were the first diners of the day at around 11:15am, and we knew we were in for something special when the lady who took out order went to a metal counter at the front window and immediately started preparing our food: dumpling wrappers made fresh from scratch, cut from the dough and rolled out while we watched. She worked quickly and with obvious skill, and in a short time our orders arrived.

We had steamed veggie, egg and dried shrimp dumplings (15 per order), and two kinds of pan fried dumplings (12 per order): spinach and black mushroom, and fresh shrimp with veggie. The wrappers were outstanding: tender and not too thick. The pan fried dumplings were crispy on the bottom with lacy fried flour connecting them, and the steamed dumplings were juicy and well sealed to keep in the flavour. All three were delicious, but my fav was definitely the steamed egg\/dried shrimp. The spinach filling was so fresh, and the whole fresh shrimp in the shrimp\/veggie pan fried was juicy and perfect. Despite having three dumplings in variation of shrimp\/veggie, all three each had its own unique flavour and were well-seasoned. I would order them ALL again for sure; however, the green onion pancake, while crisp, fresh and hot, was just ok next to the deliciousness of the dumplings - next time I will skip it and go straight to dumpling goodness!

I got on and this couple was fighting loudly so bring headphones and an mp3 player. Also other reviewers said it takes a while to get to the main parts of the strip and I can see why; just one stop later, cops apprehended a guy on the bus, 25 new people boarded, and 10 minutes had passed. It's okay for me though because I'm used to public transit like this and I'm tired so I'll sleep off my trip down to the Luxor no problem. :)",1.0

My family and I are occasional visitors of Las Vegas resorts. Occasional as in, at least once every other year. Came this past week for an early birthday celebration for my dad. We stayed in Bellagio and dined at this buffet twice this trip. And there is always a line!

So here is my TIP: Get a MLife card people! Once you reached past the beginners card, you can skip the long line at the buffets and go to the front. It probably saved us hours (no exaggeration). You also receive points on your card when you dine here (make sure you give it to them to slide).

Weekday lunch review: Used the Mlife card to bypass the long line. Super crowded. I would come before 11AM since it would be considered breakfast time and stay for both. There is a omelette service station with crab legs, shrimps as options. Eggs Benedict, salads, pizza, cocktail shrimps, carbs (pasta, bread, bagels), desserts (same as dinner), ice cream, sushi (few options), soups.

Weekday dinner review: Snow crab and king crab legs!! Prime rib (overcooked), ham (salty), rack of ribs (not bad), forgot what type of beef they had at the craving station but it was good, cockshrimps, pizza (why would you..), salad, 5 types of soups, dessert, ice cream machine, sushi, fruits, pasta, lots of fish, tuna and salmon poki. I had a food baby that night. As I recall from trips before, the Wicked Spoon had better options for desserts. Dessert isn't the best here nor special. Overall it's a good buffet though.",1.0

"Absolutely love Cholla trail!  So beautiful and breath taking in more ways that one....sight and effort!  The length is perfect from a cardio and endurance stand point.  The walk from parking is perfect to warm up your hips and core before you start climbing up.

I love that there are flat stretching to run and stretch the legs out in between increases in elevation.

"BEST. DONUTS. EVER.

Seriously, these are the best donuts I've ever eaten. I love donuts and I am ecstatic that I have found this place. We moved to Phoenix less than a month ago and this is a sign that we've moved to the right place.

I've had a number of different types of donuts here and all have been great. While they seem simple, the glazed raised donuts are delicious. Cinnamon crumb = yum. The buttermilk bars are killer. The donuts holes are also really great. I haven't had any of what they consider ""fancy donuts"", but they look amazing. I also can't wait to try the croissants after reading the reviews here.

You can't even compare Rainbow Donuts to Dunkin' Donuts. They are in a completely different class altogether. The donuts here are so light, it's dangerous. I could eat way too many. The baker's dozen is 14 donuts, but I haven't gotten that many yet. These don't keep long, which is a great sign that they aren't full of preservatives or unnecessary ingredients. The two college-aged kids that work here are super friendly, even after they've been asked a million times what each donut is. 

Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately for my waistline), they run out early in the day. If this place was open for a late night donut run, I would be in trouble!",1.0

"Just like they claim in all their ads around town - Best buffet in Vegas! Many buffets have a lot of different types & styles of food to offer just like this one, but if you compare each dish alone to the quality of a restaurant that specializes in that type, the buffet food doesn't hold it's own. But not here! 

Each dish ranked in the top 3 I've ever had, from the beef brisket and ribs, to their pizza, Thai food. I could have stayed on one style of food & would have been completely satisfied! The night before, we ate at another well known buffet and I was disappointed by the quality but with the quantity of different types made the dinner alright. There may have been only 2-3 dishes I'd even want to go back for seconds. Here I wished I could have, on pretty much every dish but the stomach wouldn't let me.

I did straddle the meal between lunch & dinner (which started at 3pm) to get the lower $ (35 instead of 50). Yes it's a bit pricey but SOOO worth it!",1.0
The food is always great here. We've had just about everything on the menu and its always been good. The service is hit or miss but the food makes up for their short comings. Just don't be afraid to wave down your waiter if you want a refill.,1.0
New favorite coffee shop! Absolutely love it! Fantastic customer service and the best coffee I've ever had. Definitely need to try out!,1.0
"I had Rudy's in New Mexico and it was so good.  Then they opened one up in Chandler, and I was excited!  I was super excited that a Rudy's was opening on the West side. No more driving 40 mins to get BBQ.  Like always, I love the moist brisket and the baby back ribs.  The corn on the cob was so sweet and good.  I like the Sissy BBQ sauce.  Yes, I am a wimp.",1.0
I enjoyed this inside look at a product I see almost every day. The tour has a 10 minute video explaining the history of the company and a walking tour that allows you to taste chips fresh out of the fryer (the highlight for me). Our tour guide was friendly and knowledgable.  At the end of the tour you get a free bag of chips. The whole thing took about 30 minutes. You can walk - in or reserve a specific time slot.,1.0
"The first thing you'll notice when you walk in are the two glass cases full of beautifully decorated old-school donuts. To be fair, that's probably all you'll pay attention to at any donut shop, but the variety here is pretty extensive.

Regular and ""inverted"" cinnamon rolls (they kind of resemble brains), classic and cake donuts a plenty, sprinkle- and frosting-topped versions for purists, and ""fancies"" like maple bars (no bacon here!), buttermilk bars (a surprise hit!), giant bear claws, and eclairs. Anything with fruit is generally really well done here, too.

I'm not even really much of a donut fan, but this place gets an extra star for not pulling that cash-only BS that other places do. Also, they're open til 6PM!",1.0
We were seated quickly. The staff was very friendly.  My husband ordered the 67 cajun sandwich. He liked the sandwich but was disappointed that it was not as spicy as described on the menu.  My sandwich was very delicious as well... No disappointments for me.  The assortment of fries was pretty neat.  We were both very impressed by the iced tea. Generally we drink or tea sweetened but the tea was so delicious that we didn't need to add sugar.  We would suggest trying this dig.,1.0
"Fantastic Indian food, tucked away in a very unassuming part of Carnegie.  I loved the selection of different types of chats, kati rolls, and appetizers.  I could make a meal on that alone!  My family and I came here and ordered quite a few things for lunch.  Standouts were the cut mirchi, Gobhi Manchurian, fried rice, and pani puri.  I ordered the chicken tikka masala for my entree, and while it was good I felt it was extremely creamy.  I was hoping of more of a tomato based taste.  I think it would have tasted a lot better without the cream, or at least less of it.  My family and I stuffed ourselves to the bone, and ended up not eating dinner that night at all.  I will definitely be back, and might even consider them to cater an event.  Worth the trip to Carnegie!",1.0
"I LOVE PANCAKES!  And if YOU LOVE PANCAKES, this place is a MUST!

What makes this place even better is their Asian inspired breakfast items...makes the whole family happy!  We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas. 

On both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes. 

Everything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w\/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. 

Just to highlight on a few:
1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories. 

2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness. 

3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly.

"My favourite place to shop for groceries. It's a one way stop to heaven! Ha! They have everything from clothes in the little shops within the supermarket to even a makeup store! The grocery selection here is no joke. They have everything Korean! Although they can be quite overpriced, the products I've bought are so worth it. I love the ramyeon, jajangmyun, etc noodles section of the market. They have SO MUCH selection. 

The workers here are nice, but they don't really communicate with you unless you have a question. And when you do, they are more than happy to help you and assist you with satisfying and answering your question. I also like that the grocery market itself has a hot food section where you can purchase cooked Korean food. They sell kimbap, soondae, dumplings, and etc freshly made every morning. The kimbap (laver roll) and the corns are put 50% after 8PM which is pretty awesome!!!!


My favourite part of this entire market is the FOOD COURT!!! Freaking awesomely, amazing selections of Korean foods you can order. I love, love the jajangmyun and sweet and sour pork combo, the kimchi stew, and the octopus udon mmmmm!

"This is the newest addition to CostCo's in GTA. I guess a lot of people don't know this location as there are hardly any lineups here unlike most of the other CostCo I have been. Even on the weekend I was in an out in in less than half an hour. Just perfect in my book. 
My affinity towards CostCo has been built on the unbeatable Cost\/Value proposition they offer and the unmatched return policy they have is just icing on the cake. 
The variety of items is a bit better than other location IMO. Couple that with the low wait times I would say this is on the better CostCo in GTA. Too bad I can't bet here without a car though I would say worth the extra driving to get away from the Queensway location which is a mad house on the weekend.

"Just moved here from out of state, took 3 months to get my first appointment , then they canceled and rescheduled, a month further out.  A month out from my scheduled appointment they canceled again and pushed out 6 weeks further.

I give them a higher rating since I was referred to specialty clinics at the VA hospital.  The doctor ordered tests and follow up appointments with him.

We started with the cheese and meat board.  Best I have had!!  The portions were generous and so delicious!  We also had the Calamari and it was also the best I have had.  I have had these two dishes in many restaurants and I will totally be back just for these two items!!  There were six of us and everyone raved about their food.  It was fun watching the guy make homemade pastas in their open kitchen.  They have a good happy hour and I will definitely be back to try several other items on the menu!",1.0

Being from Texas I'm a hard judge on BBQ and this place held it's own! The brisket was smoked and juicy and the short ribs were to die for! Word of advice get small portions so you can try a little bit of everything, they have fresh made to order street tacos that were incredible! Overall wonderful experience and upscale environment. It's a must do when coming to Vegas!",1.0

One of the only places that sells microwaveable artichokes (I cannot properly steam an artichoke to save my life, nor do I have the patience to wait 45 minutes for one to cook). 

Always clean, super friendly staff. Every time I'm there I swear I get asked how I'm doing at least 4 times. And no sideways looks when I go up and down the same aisles 20 times because I am indecisive. They are always super quick to help when you need help checking out (say, an ID check when you are buying alcohol). I love that they sell things in individual-sized packages. I live alone, so I really do not need the family size package of chicken breasts. This is one of the few places that has the smaller portion sizes. 

I wish people would not complain about F&E employees not helping you bag. That is not part of their job. No baggers, all self checkout, concrete floors - these are all parts of the F&E business model that keep prices low, just the way I like them. Also, you can link your phone number to your friends card, so if you don't have your card on you, you can just input your phone number - you don't need an employee to swipe a store card for you. 

My only complaint is that I wish there were a greater selection of fruits. Lots of empty crates (although I guess it is a good thing that people are gobbling up the fruit!). I'd also like to see more fresh cut fruit in packages (I'm lazy). I'd also like to see them sell the little half-packs of eggs and half-loaves of bread.",1.0

Fast food establishments aren't my usual cup of tea. But I made an exception with this place. Customer service was great you were pleasantly greeted, the drive through had a long line but they managed to get everyone out if there within 10 minutes. I really enjoyed my food.

Yes it's $5 for a slice and you'll need two but it's small price to pay for convenience and feeling ok the next morning. The whole pie is a much better deal but if you can wait the 25 minutes, you probably don't need it and can get a more quality pie elsewhere :)",1.0

Right from the start I was impressed because it was the longest consult I'd ever had.  I appreciate stylists who want to get it right and Susan definitely did!  I'm very happy with the results.

We both had pastrami sandwiches but I had only a half with some soup and boyfriend had the whole. The soup was really thick with veggies and meat.

We could have split the one sandwich since it was so huge. I was able to eat about 1\/4 of it since they give you massive chunky fries and cole slaw.

I saw some other people getting different things and it looked good so I would come back to try some other items but this isn't my number one favorite place by any means.

"Great family owned sushi joint. The location is small and quiet, staff is super friendly and service is good. The sushi is good quality for the price, and is conveniently located in our neighborhood. They use very fresh ingredients and a good size menu. I'm a no-frills sushi kind of girl (no tempura or mayo for me, thank you!), and typically order a spicy roll and sashimi. Their spicy tuna and California rolls are delicious (real crab is a big plus), and sashimi is very fresh and tasty. We really enjoy coming here!",1.0
"Just had Sunrise Pizza for the first time and would definitely eat there again!  I ordered through Grub Hub and was quoted an hour delivery time and it came in 30 minutes. This was thw hottest delivery food we have received in a long time! The pizza was so good my picky 4 year old had 2 pieces. The sandwiches we ordered were great and huge, we were so full we couldn't eat the fries. Next time we will try breakfast,  because who doesn't want breakfast delivered?",1.0
"I've gone here a few times and was pleasantly surprised they offered a veggie ""burger"" option that wasn't just a veggie pattie. They use mondo sized portobella mushrooms which is lightly battered tempura style and top it off with large onion rings. A little on the greasy side but full of flavor with their signature bang bang sauce. For a veggie option it's the same cost as a meat option which I don't see how that is fair. I usually order it with sweet potato fries with a sweet maple white sauce but the sweet potato fries are always over cooked and rubbery. 

If you've ever been to a Zoe's Kichen or Panera that is how this restaurant is set up. But the atmosphere reminds you of a Chipotle. You go in, fall in line and order and they give you a number as you wait at a table of your choosing. Service is very friendly and helpful with their menu.",1.0

They know what they're doing at Vogue and they do it well. Special event, anniversary?? See above. Or enjoy a special. The specials are worth it!

"Being new to the Las Vegas area, I was dreading finding a new hair salon.  Where to start? Yelp, of course.

I researched and researched for about a week(yes, I'm thorough) on all of the different hair salons and their stylists and I knew that I had to go to Platinum Entourage.

I AM SO HAPPY I DID.  From the beginning with the consultation with Todd, I knew that I was going to be taken care of.  I scheduled my appointment for two weeks later, and admittedly was anxiously awaiting the day.

Now, I was going from a mousy brown and throw in some other colors for over the years and way to much gray to rock at my age.  I was looking for something that would eliminate the need for coloring my hair every three weeks because not only does it grow quickly, did I mention it's really gray?

Todd's solution - the most gorgeous, ""I can't believe I wasn't born with this color"" blonde that I could ever imagine.

Heather and Todd, you two are AMAZING.  I felt comfortable from the moment I sat down and knew that I was in capable hands.  You both strive for perfection and that to me speaks volumes.   The fact that you took the time to make my hair look natural and wouldn't stop until it was just right......you are AWESOME!!

I still can't believe what you accomplished and I have gotten tons of compliments on my hair.  I'm also at the the three week point where I'd be coloring if it were still brown and you can't even tell there is gray.  THANK YOU!!!!

I have definitely found my salon and refuse to go anywhere else.

At exactly 15 minutes our table was ready so I was happy.

I went with a egg white skillet, with pepper jack cheese, turkey sausage, tomatoes potatoes, avocado on the side and some buttermilk pancakes.

Visited with employees to celebrate one's birthday. We all opted for bentos and it's amazing how much food you get for the money.  We all waddled away content... once we managed to pry ourselves from our chairs.

Tomo's has the usual variety of bento options-- all have some tempura and a ginger-dressing salad, some maki sushi, and meat options. Our group had the A, B, C, and E.  They offer one of the best bentos around and the sushi was surprisingly good.  I'm used to very hit-and-miss experiences with sushi in the Valley.  Truthfully, much more miss.

I also compelled the young men to sing Happy Birthday to our birthday boy. You could tell it wasn't their thing, but they didn't hesitate to give it a go.  It was a sad, off key rendition by all of us at the table.  Not a lick of harmony, but scored a 25% tip for earnest effort and fried ice cream with delicately placed candles!

"We hardly take the furry one on vacation with us because we didn't think hotels were that dog friendly. You can always get a cheap rate on strip or off strip, but your choices are pretty limited when you have a pooch traveling with you. Luckily, after some research, we found a few places off strip that were affordable (La Quinta being one of them).

There weren't a lot of reviews for this particular La Quinta, but I've stayed at another La Quinta in Northern California before and it was pretty decent (affordably and clean).

From the moment we walked in, the staff was courteous and helpful. We checked in late in the afternoon and they even called our room about 15-20 minutes after we checked in to see if we needed anything.

The rooms are pretty basic, but had the essentials we needed (fridge, microwave, hair dryer and a TV with cable!).

We stayed on the first floor, which was actually one level below ground level, facing the parking lot. At times it was loud, but not terrible since we were pretty tired most nights.

If you need to bring Fido with you on vacation, La Quinta Inn is a great choice. I really enjoyed a smoke free hotel and the freshly baked cookies they have at the front desk in the evening aren't bad either. We didn't really get to try their complimentary continental breakfast, but it looked like it had some pretty good options (hard boiled eggs, cereal, toast, yogurt and milk).

"Living in New York city for so many years I would chuckle over tourists. Just standing abruptly in utter fascination, usually in the middle of the sidewalk, blocking commutes in Times Square. In the office we would chalk it up to visual overload. 

So when I walked into TEXAZ Grill and behaved similarly I laughed at myself. Opening the doors to this restaurant was unbelievable. Memorabilia from the Great State of Texas. Covers. Every. Square. Inch.  

Neon lights greeted me.  ""Texas!"" (Also neon shapes of Texas were everywhere.) An old school juke box. Beer signs galore. Guitars hanging. A giant gull head. Horns. John Wayne behind the bar. ""Happy Birthday Texas!"" The best collection of inappropriate stickers *ever*. License plates of every state covered the bar. The collection has been cultivated over 28 years by the the owner and patrons. (Tip: When you go, feel free to bring stuff in!)

Anyhoo, stuff. My eyeballs were full. Finally I made it to the bar and met Tammy. (A hoot who has worked here 18 years!) After inquiring where I was from, a peppy response, ""Well, welcome to Texas!"" (And so I fell in love with this place. Before food even factored into the equation.)

ENTREES
So the food... A tad concerned there wouldn't be a healthy option to consume I was incredibly wrong. (Plenty of non-fried options!) The ribeye steak was to die for. (Perhaps the mashed potatoes with gravy were necessary to consume. But I just had to try them!) 

The meat was prepared to the exact pinkness level requested. I can't even describe the level of food happiness that transpired that night. The meat was just so tender. I had made the mistake of noshing on the spicy hot peanuts available on the bar, as well as eating my way thru the delightfully prepared coleslaw that accompanied the meal.

Amateur hour. Yes, definitely eat the coleslaw. It was flavorful and not too heavy in mayo. (Or try the salad with the blue cheese. Wonderful chunks of cheese.) But leave space for your meal!

As I wasn't dining solo I had the opportunity to sample a burger. Holy bejeebers. This isn't a frou frou burger. This is a simply prepared burger, sans grease, on a beautiful bun with high quality meat. 

DESSERT
We earned a bread pudding! One second and I'll explain how. Tough decision as to what to pick but we went with the french bread in an egg custard with toasted pecans & raisins. Why?

"In Yelp we trust. I was looking for a great sushi place in Las Vegas for the wife and I on our recent visit and Yelp truly came through. With some help from some local knowledge, we were able to make it to Yonaka and we are both thankful.

I can't recall getting this level of quality sushi at this price anywhere, let alone Las Vegas. Maybe I am used to the sticker shock prices of the Strip. We started off with an interesting amuse bouche of a strawberry with some foie gras mousse. Well, I should say that I started with both of them as the wife was not feeling the foie gras this evening. I did encourage her to try a piece of it, but I also gobbled the second one down after 3 straight no responses. They were really indescribably delicious. How they made the foie taste like sweet caramel while preserving the flavor of the foie is beyond me. And then we ordered sushi!

Our sever talked to us about their menu options since it was our first visit. We opted not to do dinner for two with chef selections, because we had already decided on some items that we wanted to try. We started with the sake orenji, which is one of their signature dishes. The citrus and salmon worked perfectly together. We followed that by some hotate kokoro (scallops) and uni to ikura (sea urchin). Again everything was expertly prepared and taste phenomenal. The wife was not the biggest fan of the uni, but that just meant more for me. Next was a smoked hamachi special plate that was on their daily special menu and shioyaki saba (grilled mackerel). Ok, now the grilled mackerel was great, but the wife and I agreed that the smoked hamachi was the best piece of fish in recent memory. So much so that we loaded up another plate of it in sashimi form. I am sure that I missed a plate or two in there somewhere as there was more sea urchin for me and something else the wife wanted.

"Hey kids, looking for a place to spend your allowance on cool stuff while shopping in Robinson Twp? Then this is the place for you. In fact, this Half Price Books is golden. I'm a regular here and I have been to my share of book warehouses, used book stores, and other Half Price Books stores, and this one gets the Big J Seal of Approval.

I really like the used CD section here. They have a nice selection of vinyl as well (including new as well as used LPs), but I have yet to delve back into the world of the 33 1\/3, seeing how I mostly gave that up by the late '80s. Still, if I ever do go that way once more, I will undoubtedly buy some rekkids here. But anyway, back to the CDs. It's not a huge nor a vast selection, but I do usually wind up walking out with at least five discs every time I go in. Between the regular priced used stuff and the dollar clearance section, I have found lots of treasure in there. Why, just today I picked up some NRBQ and a '60s psych compilation featuring over 20 tracks from bands located in Illinois. Too hip for even the hipsters, dudes!

Half Price also has a really, really good used DVD section as well. Like the music section, I've bought tons of movies and TV shows on DVD here. All the stuff is nicely alphabetized and easy to peruse. And, also like the CD section, there's a whole big clearance area as well. Today I got GREASE 2, one of the greatest terrible movies of all time! How could anyone have gotten rid of it? Whatt he heck ever happened to Maxwell Caulfield? I'm too lazy to look it up on Wikipedia, so I'll just continue to wonder. 

What about the books? Holy, wow! Lots of great books here. One of my faves is a copy of the Led Zep tome Shadows Taller Than Our Souls. I had been looking for it for a while, as my former GP clued me in to it during a visit to the office when I had one of my kidney stone episodes. He said it was great! It really is! And it was HALF PRICE, just like the store's name says it would be, like it should be. There's all sorts of extra goodies in the book, like facsimiles of papers and business cards and stuff that you can pull out and pretend like YOU WERE THERE.

So yes, a ton of great books in all genres, including a section of first editions and really old dusty things that everyone's grandma has lying around the house just waiting to be set free into the world of used book stores. 

There are also puzzles and video games, stuff for your tablets and smartphones, groovy little rock and roll and pop culture knick knacks, not terribly old magazines, USB turntables, a decent selection of comic books, some Dr. Who and Minecraft goodness, and lots more. I can spend a good hour or so easily just browsing through it all.

The staff is friendly and they know what they're doing. You can sell your old books and music and movies to them so I can buy them at a later time. I haven't personally done any selling to them, so I'm not sure how great the rates are, but I would imagine they'd be on par with other places. The point is, this Half Price Books is a great place to shop. Many gems to be discovered, or rediscovered here. Rainy days and Mondays never get me down anymore.",1.0
"Stayed here for 1 night on 8\/30\/14 for a family wedding. Since it was a big Italian Catholic wedding, both my extended family and my wife's extended family were invited. Between my room, my parent's room, her parent's room, and my sister and her fiance's room, we booked 4 rooms. 

So first of all, this hotel building is beautiful-- definitely harkens back to Cleveland's heyday. The architecture is top notch. 

With that said, this hotel is in Cleveland. I stayed for 2 nights at the Renaissance New York Times Square in April 2014 and 3 nights at the Renaissance Paris Le Parc Trocadero (right down the street from the Eiffel Tower) in September 2014. But somehow, this hotel in Cleveland cost more per night than the Renaissance in NYC and Paris. I'm at a loss on how a hotel in Cleveland can charge a premium over hotels in the heart of NYC and Paris. 

Then there's the service-- which was horrible through and through. The wedding invitation stated that there will be free valet parking. I mentioned this to the valet upon arrival to the hotel, and he told us that he'll take care of it. When it came time to check out, 3 of our rooms had a $30 valet fee tacked on. The front desk refused to remove these fees, because apparently it was the wedding party's fault for not clarifying that the ""free valet"" was apparently with a different company than the one that the hotel uses. Never mind that we asked their valet beforehands to double check...

Considering the darn wedding was at the Renaissance Hotel, you would think that the hotel's event coordinator would be on top of that. 

Also, the bride had made gift bags for her guests to be given at check-in. We only got 1 gift bag despite having booked 4 rooms. The bride was probably wondering why there were close to 50 leftover gift bags left at the front desk the following morning.

"I will never take any of my animals to this 'buisness"" again. Yes, I did mean to write buisness instead of vet, that is all they are. I had taken my cat to this particular establishment on two seperate occasions at two different locations. I have been to the one located in Scottsdale, and this one in Avondale. The service I got both times were the same...awful. I felt like all they saw were dollar signs when someone desperate for help walked into thier door.

Let me just start by telling you about my cat. He was an older cat (14 years) and had always had health problems, particularly with constipation. Both times that I have taken him to this clinic were for the same reason. He was stopped up more than usual and needed some extra help. This last time I took him though, it was different. He was foaming at the mouth and looked to be in a lot of pain. Over the course of time, he had also lost some weight so I knew that something more was probably going on, and it was probably time to start thinking about ending his suffering. So it being 10:30 pm, I had no option but to take him to the only emergency clinic I knew of in my area.

I am an RN and I know that I am not a vet, but most of the time pets have a lot of the same disease processes as humans. I also have known my cat his whole life and I can tell when he is in pain. I was trying to explain what was going on with my cat when we walked in and I felt judged. As if it were all my fault he was so sick, and that I should be ashamed of myself for letting him get so bad. Unfortunatly I had been out of town for the weekend and had someone watching him who did not know him as well as I do. As soon as I found him foaming at the mouth, and not even getting up to got the litter box I brought him in. 

So they took him back immediately and had me fill out paper work. After about 10 min they called us up to the front desk where the receptionist explains that the vet would like to do a critical assesment on him which cost $340. I was a bit confused because I knew that he was just in pain and constipated, but I loved my cat so much and trusted that they needed to do what they needed to do. We went ahead and paid for it. It included an ultra sound of the chest and abdomen, a liter of fluids (which he needed), pain medication and oxygen, among other things. Do not be fooled..they do not intend to give you all the things on the list. I paid  $340 for a useless ultrasound and some pain meds.

 Once we were in the room the vet walks in the first thing she says is, ""Well I have no idea what is wrong with him. All his blood and vitals are normal. "" This is exactly what the vet in Scottsdale had said as well (about a year ago). I try to explain to her that I know that he is constipated and that just needs help expelling. He has been to the emergency vet more than once for this problem and that his regular vet is aware of the problem. She proceeds to tell me that she did feel a mass that was quite large in his abdomen, but she was not convinced it was feces, rather, she thought it might be a tumor. She said the only way she would be comfortable treating him would be to get x-rays (which cost $240). We told her we would prefer for her to just treat it as constipation and skip the x-rays. Her response was how dangerous that could be, and that she would write up a couple estimates and let us talk about them.

The vet leaves and shortly after the tech comes in with the estimates. One is for $1400 and the other for $450. Both of which included x-rays. One of them included deep sedation to manually remove the problem. The huge problem with that is that he was old and not breathing as well as he could have. It would have killed him to put him under sedations and I have proof of that. We told them that would like to see our cat and see how critical he was. They agreed and we went back to see that he was doing much better and not foaming at the mouth. We asked if they would just give him an enema, and they said they would as long as we signed an against medical advise paper. We complied and were on our way.

In my heart I knew that he was not going to get better. I basically was asking the vet if she thought it was necessary to put him through all the tests due to his age and all she said was, ""well yes he is getting older"". I was relying on her to say he is in a lot of pain and I dont think he will make it much longer. Instead she decided to give me a $1400 estimate on all the tests she wanted to run.

A few days later I decided it was time to take him to his regular vet to see what they thought. The minute the vet walked in the door she told me I was right to think about euthanesia. By the time he had gotten to the vet, he was not constipated anymore but still not eating or drinking. We had to put him down. When we did and they put him in deep sedation he couldnt breathe, and the vet had to put him down even faster. They would have killed my cat for over $1400. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PET HERE",0.0
"If you're interested in buying a new Honda, this is a great place to go. They are willing to negotiate and aren't pushy like some of the other Honda dealerships in the valley.

"We had our company dinner at this restaurant a couple years ago. It's one night that our staff most looked forward to every Christmas.I was the one who did the booking. The dinner for 10 was $800+ (not cheap right?) including tax but not including tips. There was abalone and some other expensive ingredients but in terms of the number of dishes, there weren't too many. I asked the booking staff if that would be enough for a party of 10 (as most Chinese banquets usually have well over 8-10 courses but this one was less). The staff said,"" Don't worry! It's good for 10 very muscular guys.""

We had 4 guys and 6 ladies. We finished all the desserts and I could see that our staff were not full (neither was I and I'm not even a big eater). We had to order a couple more fried rice and noodles to quench the hunger. When the bill came I thought they would do something to our complain about not enough food. Nothing! Anyway my boss was nice enough to tip $100 as he thought it's no fault of the waitresses who served us (now I even wonder if the tips would go to the waitresses!). When I went out to get the bill (we paid and the receipt never came, so I had to go to the front counter to ask for the bill), I was told that at this all inclusive price, they don't issue receipt.

We decided since we were ostensibly stuck in this cowboy version of a higher end Holiday Inn, we dove in and tried everything they had to offer. We upgraded from a regular room to a Suite to begin with....Hmmmm. Very strange configuration. You walk through two locked doors and you are presented with one of the most poorly decorated living rooms I've seen in a while, but bonus, at the end of the room, a little office that overlooked the pool. Off to the bedroom. Certainly large enough for two, but the austerity was just strange. The bathroom was equally as awkward. There a sliding door on the toilet portion and don't push too hard, or it sounds as if a bomb went off. The shower door, circa 1950. A large tub, but no jets. It was just disappointing. The lighting was poor too. Oh well, what about the food. Well, that's pretty interesting too. We ate at all their restaurants and candidly, nothing to brag about except the cafe where an egg breakfast was $4.95. Can't really beat that. So we stayed here for one week, ate at their best restaurants every night, had wine and walked out with a $2,100.00 bill. That's really fine for Las Vegas. So if you want to stay in an okay place and not spend a fortune, South Point is tolerable.

It's clean and comfy and you don't feel any weirdness during the massage.  I was so comfy, I think I fell asleep for a bit.  Only thing was me and my friend were getting our massages next to each other and the ladies were chatting a bit, which was a little distracting.  But otherwise, you come for a nice massage for a decent price.  It's not the ""Spa"" experience that the nicer places offer but it's sufficient and does the job.  They do use a scented lotion for the massage and you keep your clothes on, so the massage is over a towel.  They did a great foot massage of all the body parts!

The food arrived in a timely manner, the delivery guy was cool. So we tipped him well. :-) fast forward to opening the bag, and wham! Guess what we found? A damn mess! Thinking of starting a hashtag with #littledump  as a result. 

It was like going to work ER at the emergency room. The containers were all heavily sauced as they had been thrown around like basketballs. Check out the pictures of the attempted triage of the nasty situation here if you want. 

This was outrageous and we really thought that people should know what they're getting to go from here.

I won't be going back to Catch, unless I am with a group and I am outnumbered. 

The ambiance is alright. It looks nice when you walk in, the ceiling is really funky, there are nice retro lights, and the bar is attractive. There is an open kitchen, and the tables have that currently trendy live wood edge. The chairs are hard and uncomfortable, and something I would expect to see outside of a restaurant on the patio, not inside. The seating is really tight, like they have tried to cram just a few more tables in. 

Someone took my coat and gave me a coat slip. Nice touch.

The service was alright. My cocktail did not arrive as quickly as I would have liked, especially since I could see it sitting on the counter, waiting to be delivered.  We received bread, which I don't eat, and then the appetizer arrived in good time, and it was hot. We had the lobster fritters. These are pretty good, but not really much of a flavour, so you really need to use the sauce. 

Then we waited for our wine, and then for our dinners. The wine arrived first, and then the server tried to serve us the food that was for another table. Interestingly enough, the other table ordered the same sides as us. So once that confusion was straightened out we waited some more for our food. Now we are getting to the, I am half done my glass of wine, and where is my dinner point of the meal. When the food arrived, I was served last.  This always happens to me at restaurants, and at this point in life I am getting annoyed. Not only was I served last, my food arrived cold. I ordered the mixed grill, which is a mix of seafood served in a skillet over a bean salad. 

Well, they tell me that they serve the fist over a cold salad, and they are aware of the fish being cold problem.  So here is what I think. 1. either tell me the fish will probably be cold when it gets to the table (and I won't order it) or 2. fix the way you serve the dish, especially when it is $25 just for the grill, not including the sides.  
So the dish was taken away to be reheated, and I sat and waited for a few minutes while my partner ate his piping hot food .  My level of annoyance is rising. 

We had 2 sides. The broccoli and the mushrooms.  Huge pieces of broccoli are the side. We were not provided with knives capable of actually cutting the broccoli so I ate  it by eating first it leafy head and then its mostly tender stem. The mushrooms are really garlicky, and I can still taste them, even after thoroughly brushing my teeth. (To me this is not a good thing).

Once my plate was returned,  I found whatever fish they had put in there to be sort of fatty and not at all to my taste.  The 1 shrimp tasted like shrimp and the calamari tasted like calamari. Overall, it was highly unimpressive and could have used some better fish (these may have been anchovies that were over charred) and some pepper. 

We did not get dessert. I asked for my coat as we gave them the credit card to pay for the meal.  

Overall - entirely too expensive for food that is nothing better that what I can make at home for a fraction of the price.  Actually, all the fist I make at home is better than what I had, and is a fraction of the price.

"I have lived in Charlotte for 21 years and am very frugal when it comes to furnishings, so I USED to love going to the consignment shop (used to be Consignment 1st......now I know why he has lost his franchise with them....but I digress) in Pineville. Courteous personel, always willing to pick up or deliver items.  Always willing to negotiate on price and make a fair deal.......NOT ANYMORE!

When I returned the next day, the owner said, oh, my employee was wrong, you can't take the other 2 or you will have to pay for them.  I regretted to inform him, that good customer service would intail standing behind his employees and eat the cost and that would be his cost of doing business.

"First, let me tell you that I am now 100% Disabled Veteran due to this below mentioned surgery and this surgery was ""Fee Based"" from Phoenix VAMC.  It has taken me 3 years to write this review.  I had scheduled surgery with Dr. Michael Hibner on 12\/27\/2011 (I waited 11 months to have this surgery) and it was the worst mistake I have ever made in my life.  This surgery was supposed be a simple laproscopy with an overnight stay.  Dr. Michael Hibner and his staff almost killed me by lacerating my bowel using the DaVinci robotic machine, and then lied that this happened. I was also given Ketamine against my direct orders that I and my fiancé told Dr. Hibner face to face at the time of being admitted. However, Dr. Hibner (and St. Joseph Hospital) were performing a drug trials at this time. Knowing that I was a Veteran, they knew they could not be sued.  Against my direct orders, the Anethesologist and Dr. Hibner administered Ketamine anyway. The Anethesologist stated in my medical record, that I agreed to this drug trial.  Another lie! Because the side effects of Ketamine are similar to a lacerated bowel,  Dr. Hibner and staff misdiagnosed the lacerated bowel and dismissed it as being a negative reaction to Ketamine. Dr. Hibner's medical notes says ""patient allergic to Ketamine"".  By this time,7 days had past and I became severely septic throughout my entire body and almost died.  On January 3rd, I went back in surgery to fix my lacerated bowel by a wonderful surgeon, Dr. McGeever. He saved my life...he sewed up all the wholes in my bowel and then wrapped my entire intestines with mesh.  I was released from the hospital on 1\/7\/2012, but was still very sick when I returned home. My finace' took me back to the hospital 
on 1\/8\/2012 and was re-admitted for abscesses; however Dr. McGeever was reluctant to have me undergo another surgery, so we took a wait and see approach.  It worked out, and I was finally released  from the hospital on 1\/12\/2012.  
One more side note,  a Phoenix VAMC Physician (I am purposely leaving out his name) took his wife to Dr. Hibner, and she was also severely injured.  Do you get the connection? We cannot bring lawsuits against Dr. Hibner, the Anethesologist, nor St Joseph Hospital because we are military. The most important thing is my medical records were altered by Dr. Hibner to say that I had an ""incarcerated bowel"" versus what really happened was a ""lacerated bowel"".  Along with the Anethesologist stating in her words that I and my boyfriend agreed to the Ketamine trial, which we did not.  I am now wheelchair bound and cannot eat solid foods due some nerves that were ""accidentally cut"" during Dr. Hibner's surgery.  Once again, Dr. McGeever is awesome and saved my life.  I am thankful to be alive!",0.0

"Came in on a Friday night and it was pretty dead- only two other tables on the patio.  We waited about 15 minutes for someone to come take our drink orders, and the waiter was clueless.  Asked for some beer recommendations (since beer on tap is their ""thing""), and the waiter admitted he didn't really know what they have and had only been there a few days.  My husband finally just asked for ""anything that is NOT an IPA"", and guess what he got?  An IPA.  If you're going to tout yourself as a ""nano brewery"", the waiters should be trained on what beer you offer!  We planned on ordering dinner there as well, but after looking over the unimpressive, expensive menu, and waiting another 15-20 minutes to get our drinks, we decided waiting on food would be too much of a disaster.  We left disappointed.  Even more disappointing, looking at my bank statement today, it looks like they double charged us for our bill....

Went back the next day (friends were already there so we begrudgingly joined them), and the bartender at the bar was incredible rude.  Didn't acknowledge us at all.  Our friend finally got his attention, after about 10 minutes of standing at the bar (which was not that busy at all), and the bartender waved him off!  I was stunned.  He then got our order wrong.  Definitely last time I will try that place.  Disappointing because they allow dogs on the patio and I was looking forward to bringing the pups there.",0.0
"One of my worst dining experiences in terms of food taste and overall experience. I have given it 2 star because the staff is polite and the food does look very presentable - top chef style. 

To start off: a Blackboard menu? Common, its cool and all but if you are a pricey restaurant it doesn't suit the image..... Plus our server asked us to walk around (in case I have bad eyesight) or pull up a smartphone to view the menu... HUH? 

Menu selection is limited - 5 or so appetizers, similar number of main courses, 3 desserts, and a lot of alcohol. This is actually a good thing, as a 2 page menu can get confusing, so a simple and condensed menu worked for me. I hear the menu changes often so a plus if you go there when they have a few good options. We had 3 fish options, 1 beef, 1 tofu and 1 pig option to choose from.

NACL (their logo) - Sodium Chloride or salt (cool right), except that all the food I ate had an overdose of salt.  We ordered steak tartare and it was salty, lacked any citrus and to me tasted like it was just thawed from the freezer. Sashimi was ok but nothing to die for. Avocado ice-cream along with the sashimi was innovative but again salty for my palate. We should have tried the oysters but I leave that for my imagination. They like to use a lot of deep soup bowls to serve food but the presentation was top notch.

For main course, we ordered the beef and baramundi. The beef was sliced into strips making it easy to eat, was cooked perfect and overall was tasty. Only saving dish that entire night. The baramundi was salty and not impressive in my opinion but nonetheless sufficient portion wise for one person. Just a note the entrees are 25+ and usually enough for one person (unless you have a small appetite). You will not leave the place feeling hungry or overstuffed.

Shortbread dessert was caramel, pretzel, a lot of peanuts and salt. Not a good way to end the meal. I guess there was a shortbread somewhere in there.

I forgot to mention the drinks (cocktails) are interesting combinations (negroni and moscato, rum and grapefruit) and if you go there for some appetizers and a few drinks, it is well worth it. I would not say our server was super attentive but we managed.

One thing that ticked me off was that they have communal type seating below and tables above. I had called to make a reservation and they said they were booked but when we went there (9pm), they were empty and still no tables?

A waiter with terrible teeth sits down next to us uninvited and whispers amid all the din. Yes, yes, I know this is supposed to be a style a la certain American restaurants (the sitting down uninvited part, not the teeth part; American student waiters usually have perfect teeth). Sorry, never been a fan, but let's move on.

The drinks come in Hobbit-sized glasses while sporting outlandish prices. The famous chef didn't personally tend the orange groves that produced the cartoned Tropicana OJ, did he?

The ribs with pear is curious. Oh, I love thinking ""outside the box"", and I love ribs, and I love pears. Give me weird food. I'm game. But there's gotta be a point to it. The ribs are edible but nothing to write home about. The pear on the side is quite tasty, except it does nothing to rescue the sad ribs. Why are they together? To distract from the utter blandness of the meat? To disguise the poor skills of the pit master? Why not add anchovy in there too, even more fun.

The sausage (wurst?) is another forgettable concoction, overly dry like its rib cousin.

"Been here a couple times and I've quickly learned that their BBQ meats are the only thing worth getting. Don't get me wrong, their BBQ is probably the best I've had in town, but the other items on their menu? Not so good and I would not get it again.

First thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.

The other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w\/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.

Because this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted.

Having been to China and loving the food, I thought I would trust other reviewers that said the food was ""authentic"" and ""delicious"". We ordered--kimchee (actually the best thing), vegetable spring rolls (too much dough\/rice paper and oddly spiced), yau choi in oyster sauce (pretty good, a bit bland, my bf was not a fan), vegetable tong mein (was supposed to come with gyoza, it did not, overpowering flavor of sesame oil, noodles were ok, not great), my boyfriend got a seafood dish that was absolutely terrible--the seafood was nowhere near fresh (there was a long piece of calamari with rubbery material that slapped back into his face when he took a bite, and the flavor was bland).

I guess it was against better judgement to order seafood here--or go here in general, as the dining room was completely empty during prime dinner hours on a Friday. 

Our server was lamentable at best, she did not offer suggestions, and seemed hurried by her other responsibilities (and her boss was yelling to her from the kitchen) the entire time. It was if she had never been trained to serve--when I asked questions she would just shrug, and say ""are you ready?""

I did really want to like this place, but sadly it was not meant to be. We took most of our food to go (as I hate wasting food), but ended up throwing it out for fear of encountering it again.",0.0

The front of the house can get very backed up and on a recent evening that happened again to us. WE waited over 2 hours and 15 minutes to get a scallop appetizer salad. We had thought they forgot and we were getting ready to leave, when it came out. We tasted it and it tasted like cooking fuel--a definitely tainted toxic taste, so we returned it to the chef and said to just take it off the bill. 
He refused ! It was not edible, and after an otherwise perfectly fine albeit, slow and expensive ,meal was ruined because he chose to keep the 9.99 app on the bill, even though we waited 2 hours, and it was not palatable.

Because of the location, I went in here after moving.  They make you pay up front for your laundry (which I have NEVER had to do before).  But I let that slide.  The third time I went in I dropped off my boyfriends suit (the only one he has).  I went to pick it up 2 days after it was supposed to be ready and they asked if it had already been picked up....NO - I am the only one who drops off the dry cleaning and the only one who picks it up.  PLUS I had the receipt they gave me for pick up.  They said they would call when they found it. NOTHING.  We called a couple days later only to be told we would again be called back after they looked for it.  Another couple days later we were told that their records showed that the suit had been picked up with either the receipt or a phone number....which is pretty unbelievable since I had the receipt and our phone number is from a different state with a different area code - don't think someone could have accidentally mixed up that many numbers.  Still waiting for a phone call from the manager....love that we even PAID for it upfront.  This business is bad all around.  Wish I had read these other Yelp reviews first.

When we got home, we realized that what we received was substantially different than what we had ordered. No big deal, I drove back. It happens sometimes. Well, a couple of weeks later, it happened again, but this time, I'm certain that it was because the manager decided he'd rather BS with the employees than work, as they were chatting all around the counter. So, I called the 1-800 number and left a detailed message. The franchise OWNER called me directly and apologized and even gave us an unlimited and free meal to apologize.

Using Yogurtland in Chandler as the baseline of what a good yogurt place SHOULD be, let's review:

"I've been going here since moving to Vegas and here are my thoughts.  Like most barber shops\/hair salons, you have to pick the right time to go if you want to avoid a long wait.  Even when waiting a longer than usual, the staff here has always been friendly and efficient.  
I've always at least gotten a decent haircut, with a few less than stellar jobs here and there, but in general most of the stylists do a good job.  My son got his first haircut there and they were great with him and made his experience comfortable and fun.
I would rate this place higher except it's the price that is a stickler point for me.  They're up to 19 bucks for a haircut now and that's expensive for what they offer. The price has gone up fairly consistently over the past 2 years or so and while I understand it's a business, at the same time they are pricing themselves out of their core market.  The hair place across the street offers the exact same service at almost half the price.  This also affects the employees there as if the price is high, than there is less money free for tips, which is their bread and butter.

"The Skinny: hit or miss dishes depending on what you order (3), service: is better than your average Chinese joint but again is inconsistent (3.5), smaller than your average dishes and more expensive, this place is okay in my books (3).

We headed over the try the new Chinese restaurant at the Palms after hearing about their opening promotion. (Go to the hostess stand - there are 25% off dining cards available until October 15\/14). We tried dinner twice to sample a variety of dishes while the promotion is going on.

FYI - we decided to skip the $1 white rice and opted for the noodle soup and green onion pancake instead. I decided not to order the sketchy fried rice (in the Yelp pics, there is definitely soy sauce and carrots = gross) which cater to the lemon chicken crowd. I guess ""Asian-fusion"" = Americanized here.

Shandong beef noodle soup: this was a decent bowl of beef brisket soup - it tasted more like chu hou braised brisket beef noodle soup than your clear consomme beef noodle soup. My hubs is Taiwanese so it was a little different than what he is used to but he enjoyed it. Overall, it went well with the spicy food we ordered. The noodles were slightly thicker and round and had a nice bite to it. 

House tofu: a disappointing dish of fried tofu and nappa cabbage. Not enough wok-hai (heat from the wok), left the dish overly soggy with limp vegetables. The cornstarch they added in the end in an attempt to save the dish made it even more sloppy. They might have added some vinegar to the dish, resulting in an unpleasant sour taste. Not a fan.

Stir-fried green beans: (11.95) we requested the Szechuan style which was non-spicy however were accidentally provided with the spicy version of the dish. This mistake was promptly noticed by our server who replaced it with the right version. The small sample we had of the spicy version was okay - the green beans were stir-fried with cumin and whole\/crushed chilis. The Szechuan style green beans were good - stirfried with some preserved vegetables. Again, portion sizes are small for the price.

Stir-fried large pea pod leaves: (13.95) generally well executed. We ordered this dish twice and each time the leaves were appropriately prepped (meaning they discarded the fibrous portion of the plant). My only beef is that for the price, the portion size is much smaller than expected.

Smoked Tea Duck: (15.95):This dish was quite good - loved the mild smokiness of the duck. They kindly debone the breast of the duck for you so it is easier to eat. That being said, for $15, the portion size is small.

Green Onion Pancake: cannot recommend this. The pancake was tough, greasy, dense and overly bland. Avoid.

Szechuan Peppercorn Fish: (15.95) the batter was overly thick\/heavy for the fish. It was also not crispy enough. I'd pass on this dish.

Given the fact that I would probably not order half of the dishes again and the food is definitely overpriced given the quantity\/quality, I do not feel a huge urge to return even with the 25% discount. I'd like to mention that they do offer a small dim sum menu which I have not tried. Although that being said, dim sum is a Cantonese (not Szechuan) style of cuisine so you have been warned. 3 starred review.",0.0
"I've been here for lunch a handful of times over the past 5 or 6 years.  I usually get their chicken schwarma, and I enjoy it.  I've never been for breakfast, although I went for dinner for the first time yesterday evening.  The thing about this place is that it's exactly what you should expect - homestyle food.  Mom and pop place frequented by a lot of locals\/regulars.  Waitstaff has always been friendly.  The food is neither fancy nor gourmet.  Side salads consist of iceburg lettuce with some chopped tomatoes on top.  For dinner I got the Chicken Parmesan.  The chicken was nice and crispy, although the flavor of the tomato sauce was nothing to write home about, and the was only a small amount of cheese sprinkled on top.  The rest of the guests with me for dinner (from Michigan, I might add) enjoyed their meals.  And the taco salad that one of them ordered looked amazing!

Having remembered positive praise about the ""Fancy Pants"" pizza, we decided to give one of those a whirl.

The idea of an outdoor shopping mall in Cleveland is questionable, at best. Could it work? Yes. After all, Columbus has Easton, and that definitely thrives. But I think there'd have to be a major draw, with great stores and restaurants, to make people brave the weather. Legacy really just doesn't have it anymore.

The parking makes a bad situation worse. If there is a place that you want to go (restaurants, more often than not) you're probably going to have a hard time finding parking, which makes something that was probably already going to be inconvenient even more of a headache.

We sat down and the hostess said she would be right back with crayons, which I had to go get myself after we realized they weren't coming. We ordered 2 appetizers, macaroni bites and bruscheta. The bites were good but the toast  for the bruscheta came out noticeably burnt, something the chef or server should have noticed. The server took our order and we had to asked twice for the wine list. My 2 young children got their food first. It was fine. Then my husband and oldest got their food. My husband took one bite out of his pork shank cremini and the only thing hot was the sauce. He told the server it was cold so he took it back to the kitchen. About 10 minutes later we both received our meals. My meal was ok, not hot but warm and yes my husband's was still cold. He sent back the food and didn't reorder anything else because by this time my kids were almost done. The experience was not good. Food and service needs much improvement!",0.0
"Pros: Clean office with state of the art equipment.

Cons: 1Came in using a flier for a $40 cleaning\/X-ray\/exam and they still charged my insurance the full rate and ignored the coupon. (Very small issue)
2 Dentist has dirty fingernails. He was wearing gloves, but that still says something about his cleanliness. Had I noticed before he put his hands in my mouth, I would have been out the door. (Still not my biggest issue)

3 had a temporary crown put on by a hygienist. It was jagged and irritated my gums quite a bit. When taking it off after 2 weeks, the dentist said the temp crown was done poorly and could tell which hygienist had done it. He also stated she was only working one day a week now because of her lack of ability. Why are they not checking her work? Why is she still doing these at all if she does the, wrong? (Still not the biggest problem)
4 a different hygienist put on my permanent crown. It didn't fit properly (although it was a $600 custom-made tooth). So they decided to file it down a bit, no big deal. I was ensured that this would not affect the integrity of the crown. They told me i was done so i paid and left. During my drive home i looked at my tooth and saw stainless steel exposed all over the bottom of my tooth. It looked like i had a gigantic silver filling in the tooth. I returned to the dentist and I was told they had to file so much down that they were left with only metal on the bottom. Clearly this was not what I paid for. After explaining why this is unacceptable, the dentist offered to order a new crown that would fit, and it would be ""on the house."" In reality i was just getting what I had originally paid for.

"Nothing unique about this place. The staff weren't exactly offering to help us, so we didn't try any cheeses, therefore we didn't purchase any.

"A group of us were curious about a tree in the middle of a restaurant so we decided to give this place a try!

For being brand new, the wait for a table was moderate and typical for a Saturday night. They do allow reservations and call ahead seating. The ambiance was different and interesting with a storybook type theme throughout the restaurant. I'm a big foodie and it takes a lot for me to rate anything really highly. The baked beer cheese and brisket sandwich were really good however my side was the bacon cheddar grit cakes was bland. All I tasted was grits. I tried my friend's lobster Mac and cheese and it was also very bland and we both had bites with shell in it. Also, there wine pours were ridiculously small. They should either charge less or pour more!

"I don't know where to start with my bad experience here.  
About three or four days ago I ordered and it took an hour and a half to come.  My kids were bawling.  I have never had pizza take more than 45 minutes before, but I have never ordered here before.  Online it said it would take no more than an hour, which I figured would leave us a bit hungry but would still be ok. 

After waiting 60 minutes I called the first time.  I was surprised that it hadn't shown up yet, and even more surprised that they hadn't called me to tell me what was going on.  They said it was out for delivery.  30 minutes later, still nothing.  I call again, he says there were 2 other orders made at the same time as mine (?! so that justifies it ?! you can't handle THREE orders?!) and that is should be here any minute.  He said he would call the delivery guy.  A couple minutes later the delivery guy shows up.  He said the same thing, two other orders.  

I pay for the food. After the guy leaves I realize he forgot the one thing I ordered for myself.
NO side salad.  NO side salad,  Ugh, I'm pissed.

I open the boxes of pizza and cheese sticks and hand it out to my family.  The pizza is OLD.  Obviously it's been sitting for a long time.  It was AWFUL.  In my experience if you are raving hungry almost anything tastes fantastic, my kids cried even more after one bite because they hated it.  These kids will eat gas station pizza.  Wouldn't touch the cheese sticks either after the first bite.  Both made me gag.  It didn't help that the center of the pizza was somehow soggy.  It seemed like they either left out the salt or just had a bad recipe to begin with.

FINALLY we opened the chicken alfredo.  It was the one thing that tasted good.  We devoured it.  I open the cake, it looks different than the picture online, I figure what the heck no surprise, and it tasted fine.  I put the useless pizza and cheesesticks in the fridge in hopes I could convince the family to eat it later, no dice.  I finally threw it out today.  

Between the salad they didn't give me, the messed up pizza and cheesesticks I figure these guys scammed me out of $21.  

Honestly I would love to complain and throw a big fit, but if you have a traveling spouse and you are swamped with kids and work and whatnot the most time I have is to complain here and do my best to turn people off from this place.  

If they were a good company they would have called to say they would be late, if they were a good company I shouldn't have had to pay for old bad tasting pizza, if they were a good company they would either have better food or pay closer attention and get the recipe right, if they were a good company they would get my ORDER right, if they were a good company they would have called ME after knowing nothing except that they had taken a horribly long time to deliver and that there was no way the pizza was fresh.

"As a preface in the past I've been happy with Open Wide Dental, and have been going here for almost 4 years now off and on, but a series of circumstances have left an extremely bitter taste in my mouth. To begin back towards the beginning of the month I called them because I was having issues with one of my teeth and wanted a call back to see about any financing or if they could help me out in any way since I'm low income like they have in the past. No response after close to a week, this should have been my first sign, but I called again, they left a voice mail soon after with no real answer to my question, it was basically ""We'll see, maybe, after you see us"". Not really the kind of response I wanted since my concern was finances, what if I went in and they couldn't work with me now?

Anyway I took the chance (once again it is my fault for ignoring the signs) and called them back, made an appointment for a couple of weeks. The night before my appointment I became ill which was keeping me awake as well, so I had no choice but to cancel my appointment. To be fair it was past the normal 24 hr window (I left the message around 12 am because I knew there was no way I was going to feel good enough to go) cancellation I've ever made with them. I called them that morning to make sure they got my message, they did, and that was that. A week later I get a $50 ""no show"" bill sent to me. Which they have every right to do, but doesn't make it good business when you have a loyal customer who always shows up to their appointments, AND referred MULTIPLE people to their location. 

I was, of course, upset and did call and leave a message expressing my disappointment and that I was a bit angry about it, but it was a civil message, even if I was clear that I would not pay the $50, that I felt it was a slap in the face, and because of our financial situation I would have no choice but to go somewhere else if it wasn't resolved. That was over a week ago and no response. So much for caring about your customers. If they are willing to lose me as a customer, and maybe future referrals, that is their prerogative but it seems like a bad move to do this over $50. But it seems consistent with my treatment I received with a lack of response prior to the $50 no show (which I didn't even know they had). 

Have to give them credit though, they did get my bill of $50 to me faster then any responses to my phone inquiries!

"My friend and I were really excited to see this show as we're both Penn and Teller... but sadly, the show left a bit for both of us to desire.

The magic they do is more of up-close magic, not suited for a theater of their size.

"I've been occasioning this location since I moved to Phoenix back in 2001 and thought (since asked by the CEO) I owed them a quick review. I agree with many others that the place could use a facelift. It is located in a strip mall that needs updating by the property manager (not the fault of OCB though). Other than that the food at this location is better than average in comparison with other buffets around the valley (including other OCB locations). I've only been here for dinner so cannot comment about breakfast or lunch but I have no complaints about dinner other than I think it would be nice if there was a lower price option for seniors (65+). It should be more like half price for seniors because they generally just cannot eat that much and it seems a little steep to charge almost $15 for dinner and a drink. If it were up to me to make a change for the better and allow for a more affordable dining experience for seniors I would set the price for a senior dinner at no higher than $8.99 and it should include the drink (in other words keep it under $10 out the door). I have a friend that goes with my wife and I and he complained about the price the last time we went (just a few days ago). I agree with him and think OCB just really needs to be more ""senior-friendly"" versus kid\/family-friendly and even more so here in the valley where there are more seniors than in most other areas of the country...",0.0

The Hawaii Salad I got was bland, Unappealing looking, & was brought out on plate vs a bowl, so made it harder to eat. It took awhile too. Plus, the staff was rather lethargic and didn't have a welcoming personality to them. To be honest, it doesn't appear as if the owners consulted anyone with restaurant experience or knowledge when they decided to open this place. I was really looking forward to another healthy place to eat at, but was sadly underwhelmed and severely disappointed with this place. Unless they make some major changes to their menu (better display, more organized, less corn, have a calorie count) I doubt I'll try it again.",0.0
"Went here on a weekend to pick up some lunch. The restaurant is attached to a mall which makes you think it might have more of a laid back vibe to it, but no, walk through the doors and everybody be wearing suits and dresses. FANCY. I actually put some effort into my attire that day but still felt a bit out of place. Oh well, placed our order then hit the mall while we waited. At home we opened up the goods and this is what we got...

-Chicken Pot Stickers: Been there, done that. The thinly sliced cucumber on top was a nice touch though. 
-Shrimp Curry Noodle Soup: Tasted okay even after being in the fridge a few days. Glad to find 6 medium sized shrimp in it. 
-Chicken Cheesecake: Stay away from this. Dry and had a lifeless flavor to it. The side of thick cut sweet potato fries were good though, I think they were tempura fried. 
-Sauteed Sea Scallops: Very good! Only had 3 scallops but the meal was just so creamy and tasty it didn't even matter. A little black pepper and my mouth was pretty happy eating that. 
-Creme Brulee: A delicious end to our tasting that day. Crispy sugary crust with a smooth custard and chopped up fruit that really paired well with it.

He refuses to answer your questions, acting as though they are dumb questions. The one procedure I had done with him was a nightmare.

There's really only one level of artwork which seemed rather small, especially for a city the size of Montreal. Also, the bathroom in the basement was small and rather dirty (I hold museum restrooms to a higher standard than a McDonalds...). There are plenty of museums to be seen in Montreal, so unless you have a desire to see a specific exhibit, I'd probably skip this one.

"If you want to try many dishes, All You Can Eat Menu (AYCE)  is for you. The portions are smaller and not all the items from regular menu are included but you get the idea if Spring Rolls is for you or not. As for me - I probbaly won't come back.
The service was good, even though noone cared if we liked the food or not. We had to send back couple of dishes and noone asked what was wrong, why we did not like it.
Dishes that I liked:
Sweet potato fries were really good, mixed with kimchi (delicious), cheese and mayo. Full of calories but great dish.
Mango salad and Wonton soup were good. Chicken with ginger and broccoli was very flavourful, as well. And I really liked their Spicy Ginger Tea with Honey, even though I have to admit it was way too sweet for my taste. And boy, it really is spicy. But it is not easy to find a place with interesting, unique teas (I'm getting tired or regular green or black teas that most restaurants offer).
As for the dishes that I did not like:
Pad Thai Noodles were so-so. I usually love Pad Thai (PF Changs or most Thai restaurants offer delicious Pad Thai, but this one was a dissaster). I actually sent it back to the kitchen. I think it was the type of noodles they used that I did not like. I am not sure, it just didn't feel right. (They still charged me for the dish, even though I sent it back).
Lots of fried dishes, bright red coloring for some chicken dishes, including the Pad Thai I mentioned. There was a dish with beef ""on a bed of spinach"" - but there was no spinach (from AYCE menu). The manager explained that this dish does not come with spinach. Hmmm, okay.. so why is it called ""on a bed of spinach""?
I was looking forward to try their desserts but it was dissapointing.
Pumpkin Creme Brule came very watery and small. I was wondering if its a mini version from AYCE menu but no, it was actual size and costs $5. My friend had the same dessert and she did not like it either. It was just very sugary and watery.
I also tried their Mini Mousse.. but was not impressed again. I wonder if I'm way too picky or the food is just very average.
Note: If you go as a group and only one person wants to order from AYCE menu - it is not possible. The manager explained that everybody has to order AYCE at the table. That is just ridiculous! So should he\/she sit at the table next to us, alone?!",0.0
"I am not a big fan of this store when compared to the next closest location on Indian School & Hayden.  While this location is the closest to my house, I tend to avoid going here. The layout is odd. It is trying to be an AJ's, I feel (Bashas' owns AJ's and Food City, as well). But it is unnecessary since there is an AJ's 2 miles away.

The layout of the store is weird to me. I feel the interior aisles have no real rhyme or reason, and they do not flow logically.  The store was remodeled a few years ago and I had hope that it would feel more like other newly remodeled locations. It is dark. The middle door dumps you right in to the thick of the registers and self-checkout islands. The floral department is stuck in a far corner by the seafood, which is across from the lunch meat.  

And of all the locations, I feel this staff (at least the night staff) is the least friendly. I never get eye contact or even a ""hi"" without saying to them first.  I think this store, the staff, and the management needs to try a heck of a lot harder.

"My last review of this store in August of 2013 I gave it 5 stars, but because of this Fry's practice will now drop that to a 3 star review. I really like Fry's and their products, but this is sort of over the top, and in no way other than the fact that they are Fry's reflects on this particular store.....

To me that is a pretty decent offering. So I went over to the digital coupons section and tried to find the coupon.... It wasn't where I at least thought it should be under the canned and packaged, nor was it in ANY of the grocery categories.  I finally found the digital coupon under the ""General"" Coupons which just happened to have 249 other coupons listed. I noticed also that there were other grocery coupons in there as well.   To be honest I don't know whether to be upset about this or not. Are they trying to not let us take advantage of the coupons by burying them thinking that people will be just too lazy to go find the coupon?

"The Valley Ho only got a star because the Bell Staff and wait staff were over and beyond. Besides that they should be embarrassed. 

Let me start off by saying, we were there to celebrate a wedding. They spent $20K plus on a wedding that was completely disorganized and they should be ashamed at how many people they pissed off from the lack of caring on certain issues to the hypersensitive on things that shouldn't even matter. 

Suggestion, if you are wanting to have a good time at all in Scottsdale don't count on the Ho. We were gonna have some drinks after the wedding at 10p in our room with some of the guests since we got the Tower Suite with has a full kitchen and lots of sitting room and such. Well before we even got to our room we got a complaint, says the report the next day, I don't know how that can happen when no one is in the room. Hmm, oh maybe it was the bachelor party that was going on down the hallway that was in no connection with us. So when security made it up to the room the ""2nd"" time we had one more chance or the cops we getting called.  So we get everyone but 2 people down stairs, those 2 people were sleeping, so there was no noise, and here comes security again saying we are being loud. That is when we got super pissed. Everyone is downstairs but two people sleeping, how is this loud. Words were exchanged and we all went downstairs. 

My boyfriend then tries to talk to hotel management about the situation and they don't wanna hear it. There is a ""no party"" clause that we were told about?!?  First off, we didn't know about that & secondly when did the Ho become a place you can't part at? 

At the end of the day, save you money and don't give the Ho. Just Uber home and sleep in your own bed...

Jesse... We were at no point during our stay told about the no partying clause until after security came. At check in all there was was the passing off of the keys to the room and that's it. We understand that you are a hotel. But let it be known that a place that offers vodka sodas by the pitcher and is known as the ""party"" hotel by all AZ natives, maybe you should reassess your image.

 They advertise they bake their own bread and that is usually a sign of a better place.

I tried a Combo Appetizer so I tried a variety of things. The Dolmas were good and the salads were fresh. The Eggplant Dip had way too much tahini in it so much that it was overpowering and heavy for my taste and lacking of eggplant. I prefer eggplant dip when you taste the charred eggplant flavor. The Falafels lacked fresh herbs and tasted very flat but were edible.

"I had the opportunity to stay at the Novotel Hotel North York for the first time the Friday evening of the long weekend in August. The experience was passable but not a hotel that at this point I would be quick to recommend if other options fit. If you need a place to lay your head that is clean, safe and typically less expensive then hotels in the city core, this location will serve just fine. But if looking for anything beyond that you may want to look at other properties. 

Pros:

Check in was fast, friendly and efficient, the lobby warm, welcoming, modern and bright.

With easy access to the TTC's Young-University-Spadina (Yellow) subway line via indoor connection to the North York Center station, transit to and from downtown was simple, inexpensive and stress free. (They really do need better signage or direction somewhere regarding how to find the hotel upon arrival at the station as the hotel is so close that it is actually a bit tricky to find at first.)

Room was spacious,  and well appointed (Coffee maker, large screen TV, fridge, safe, iron & board, etc)  with décor that is relatively modern, trendy and upbeat.
King bed was extremely comfortable, with high quality linens that appeared to be well maintained 

Free Wifi internet access

Great morning breakfast buffet, well presented and the restaurant staff were all friendly, welcoming and all around pleasant to deal with. (They hire people who like people...and it shows! Thank you!)

And of course due to location, often less expensive then similar range hotels downtown or other parts of the city depending on occupancy rates and events etc. 

Cons:

Although clean, the guest floors are turning the corner and starting to look shabby. Both my room and the hallways are starting to feel tired and warn.

My room although decorated well needed a lot of work. Wall paper in the bathroom was bubbling, walls have marks on them in places, some of the furniture is looking warn etc. 

Bath tub needed help! I took two showers during my stay and the tub did not drain at all, 8 hours after taking the first I found myself standing in ankle deep water for the second as the water had not drained out at all. By the time I was finished my second the waterline was literally up my calves.

Room not sound proof at all. I could hear every conversation in the hall and nearby as though they were in the room with me. (""Laura"" your boyfriend sounds like a jerk...get out while you can!)

Hotel is quite far from downtown and most things a leisure traveler would like to be close to. (35-40 min by Subway or $20-$40 cab ride during non-peak hours) So if you are the kind of person that wants to be able to run back and forth to your hotel a lot and be in the heart of things this might not be the best location for you.",0.0

Dishwasher drops a towel on the floor mat and unknowingly steps on it.

Another server unwittingly begins to clean the wait station with said towel. Once finished the server places said towel near the silverware tubs. Moments later the server proceeds to polish all of the silverware with said towel. All this took place while the owner was completely oblivious and engrossed in whatever was occurring on his smartphone at the time.

If you live along the crippled & forlorn section of Van Buren near the Airport, I take it you're basking under a sizzling kind of blues as the unfeeling desert sun roasts your ass.

Ah, a very skinny light skinned black gal followed, tatted up & rather talkative. Finally, an Amazon blonde women took the stage, all 6'5 of her.

We started with the special wonton soup (not) and the Seaweed and egg drop soup (reasonable), the portion size was small as were all the plates except the Curry Beef dumplings.

Here's a question why were half of the Curry Beef dumplings sour and the other not? The beef in the dumplings must have been half fat was when bitten into a good spoonful of grease poured out.

The homemade noodle with pork were contained both bean sprouts and shredded cucumber, so there was a puddle under the noodles which tasteless despite the addition of the chilly oil and soy sauce.

Whether or not one is accustomed to these flavours is not so much the point as the lack of flavour. The red bean soup is meant to be dessert = sweet (not) even the rice flour dumplings in the soup had no sugar.

"$27 prix fix menu

I was drawn here by the high ratings and the $27 prix fix menu. Also, the OpenTable points are always a nice bonus :)

My BFF wanted to try something new, so I did some research on Yelp and was convinced! We came on a Sunday on the long weekend. I called to make sure that they were still offering the prix fix menu (being a long weekend and all) and they did.

They give you some bread with this hummus-like spread, which was very good. Two types of bread - the crust was hard, but not bad.

We both ordered the soup to start. It was some tomato soup (think marinara sauce) with chunks of seafood in it (I think lobster or shrimp...). A bit spicy but still good.

I had the steak frites. It was quite large - probably more than 8oz like the menu said. It was thick cut and cooked medium rare. I saw past reviews and knew that if I wanted medium rare, I would have to tell them medium. Unfortunately, it was quite tough and chewy. The aioli was good. The fries were quite hard. The picture on their website is not what came on my plate.

My BFF got the salmon. This was very good - deliciously seasoned and cooked well. I would recommend getting this. However, the size of the salmon seemed smaller than what others have gotten here, judging by the pictures on Yelp.

We were given no choice for dessert. It was an upside-down pineapple cake. It took quite awhile to get to the table, but I guess they were baking it? It was plated very nicely with super sweet caramel surrounding the cake. My BFF complained that the pineapple on top was not fresh \/ fake. I ate his share.

Service was average, I would say. We ended up paying $70 after tax and tip. I guess for a 3-course meal, it's not bad. My BFF said he would go again, and that it would be a good place for a special occasion or a date (lol). Avoid the steak frites!",0.0

One of the coolest Vietnamese restaurants in town!

I guess it can be bumped up to the next level of awesomeness!  Pho Cao is located at the edge of the city of Tempe just north of the 202.  I address that simply because the restaurant is oddly located and can be difficult to find!

Pho Cao is best during the evening hours because of the live bands and karaoke nights.  Hip and funky, Pho Cao provides entertainment and some cultural flare to your visit.  I'm a Pho snob so when I attended I order of course the Pho.  Overall, I thought it was okay at best.  It lacks the strong beefy broth that is pungent and salty at the same time.  Plus in the end, I like my broth super boiling hot where it almost burns my tongue. Yeah I'm pretty insane but I enjoy that!  

In the end, Pho Cao is an awesome place to hangout for drinks.  They have a full bar and drink specials on a daily basis.  They're opened till 2am so if you're in need of a Pho fix or just drinks.  This is your place to be! - Enjoy!",0.0

The place is super busy, guess the Chrysler plant supplies them with a steady stream of customers willing to overpay.  A veal sandwich can run as much as $15 once you start adding toppings.  If they are going to charge for extras, then they should do it by weight, like at La Rose in Etobicoke.  And watch at the cash, they can overcharge.",0.0
"Tried a 1\/4 dark roasted chicken, potato salad, chickery dipping sauce (gravy with some spices as described by server, but I didnt taste the spices) and the jalapeño cornbread for a whopping $14. 

The food wasn't bad, but nothing special. The roasted chicken was ok... But nothing to rave about. It was small though. The cornbread was moist, but again nothing special. The jalapeño flavor was light so I could have had a piece of regular cornbread and not really noticed a difference. They did give me an extra serving because the one I got was smaller than the original. Thou, I looked at pics and what I got seemed to be the same size so a freebie was appreciated.

I have to say that for the price, which is on the higher end of fast food, I didn't feel full. Probably needed to spend $5 more and get the half chicken. 

My friend ordered the salad, which was nice and big.

"this is the former Misaki Buffet .  i believe one of the 2 owner\/investors wanted out and thus the name change.  there's less sushi than there used to be and no nigiri pieces.  it's all the same American \/ Americanized-Chinese food on the buffets. A highlight (to me anyway) is the steamed tilapia along the far wall side.  A lot of the rest is just sysco \/ pre-fabricated re-heated food, clearly ... 
it was initially $6.99 but they just raised the lunch (m-f) price to $8.99 as of January, 2016.  I suspect it will continue to rise until they notice people aren't coming as often. To be honest the food is not really worth any more than the current price and you can have the proper real-deal sushi experience at places like ""Oriental Buffet"" on McKnight Road or Hokkaido Buffet in the East end near the Waterfront area.  They are a dollar or 2 more for lunch but are definetly better in quality (and atmosphere)  The problem with this space is that it's the former Tambellini Italian restaurant with all the requisite tacky Italian ristorante old school decor and embellishments.  This gets on my nerves but clearly the new owners are not interested in re-doing the interior.  The lighting can be very dim, too.  Yellow-ish lights . Not particulary conducive to eating fresh food, imo .  You can see that they truck in the kitchen employees all at once from who knows where. I just hope they are being paid fairly and reasonably .  
The only reason I patronize this place is that it's very close to where I live . Otherwise i'd head to other area buffets  like The Mintt (Indian food) and the aforementioned places.

Do Not come here!! The service is so poor. The food is so so. Not great. When this place first opened the manager then was pretty nice and food was better then too. This time I went back there are new managers there and there are very little customers. We went during peak time around 12:30 for dim sum. Anyways the reason why I don't recommend is that one of the managers sat down to talk to us and he stuck a pen inside his ear and started picking the inside of his ear and then flicked it on the floor. I looked at my family and quickly ended the conversation and left. It was disgusting and not professional at all. His shirt was suppose to be white but instead it was surrounded in black and grey dirt round his wrist and collar.

Alright I am still so LIVID about this place that I am not even going to make this a very long review because its too painful but I will say AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS unless you're going there to dance and drink. The food was TERRIBLE. My friend got chicken strips that weren't even cookied and I got this buffalo chicken wrap that was not even edible. Which coming from me NEVER happens especially when I am paying $14 for the item but it literally tasted like Vinegar wrapped in a sundried tomato tortilla. The hotsauce and the Guacamole and chicken was just non existent in the flavoring and I literally had to dip the darn thing in Queso just to be able to eat half of it . Which I only did because ...You guessed it.. the thing cost $14. We had initially been downtown and decided to check this place out because they had a veterans day special for a free burger which my boyfriend took advantage of and for being a free burger he was able to eat it but the fact of the matter is. Even Checkers does it better!  I really enjoy Toby Keith's music and I like the atmosphere with the pretty ladies in their backless chaps but we didn't even end up with a hot waitress and the music was so loud that was playing I couldn't even complain to our waitress if I wanted to but I just couldn't even stomach the energy after how bad everything was. I will hopefully be uploading some photos to cement the fact you shouldn't bother with this place but it's me and I am not always that good at attention to detail. This would have to be one of the first places I have not been able to finish my food though. I am the queen of eating pretty much anything but this place failed hardcore. The chips and Queso was definitely from a Can but that at least tasted good just wasn't worth the $... Definitely try somewhere else if you have the chance!,0.0
"They RUINED my ring...

I took an engagement ring here a few weeks ago to have the prongs changed from white gold to yellow gold. My husband and I initially ordered this ring from Blue Nile. It WAS a beautiful ring with a fancy yellow diamond. We felt my changing the prongs to  yellow gold to match the diamond it would make it more vibrant... The white gold prongs would wash the diamond out from certain angels.

When initially dropping off the ring they said it should take a week or less. After a week of waiting they said it would not be done till mid next week. At that point I decided I wanted my ring back and my husband went to get it... Well, they cut the entire center of the ring out (including the shank\/mounting, not just the prongs\/head - not what we wanted!). After almost another week (13 days total), we got the ring back. 

They had replaced the entire head with this big boxy thing that was almost double the size of the previous one. It looked way too big for the stone and did not go with the ring at all. The ring is uneven and the diamonds next to the center stone do not look secure. And now the ring does not fit with the matching wedding band that goes with it.",0.0

HOWEVER, the Luxor placed us in a room that was right next to LAX (the nightclub), which you could hear the music and the bass through the wall until 4:00AM! Needless to say, I got very little sleep that night. The Luxor NEVER informed us at check in that this would be an issue.

My California double was falling apart and covered in grease. As I ate it fell apart even more. My friend complained of the same problem with her bacon double cheeseburger.

After finishing it I was still hungry. This may just be a fat person problem, but if I drop that much on a burger I want to be full.

The staff were friendly and quick. No complaints there.

The absolute slowest Starbucks on the eastern seaboard. I waited for 10 minutes to have my order taken and another 15 to get it. That's 25 minutes for 2 grande lattes as a walkin. Plus lattes tasted burnt coffee. No mas rather do gas station coffee than this one.,0.0
"I went there with a friend of mine who had a Groupon , it was a good deal. He had the greek salad w\/Gyro meat, I choose the plate so I could try a little of everything. The falafel was okay, pre cooked and sitting for a little bit served cool, not a lot of spices but okay. The hummus was okay not very good but edible, again fell flat on flavor. The baba ganoush was the worst I have ever had, took one bite and it definitely was not fresh and tasted terrible. The Tabbouleh was okay and was much better than the hummus or the baba ganoush. The rice was good but again on the cold side. I prefer my food to be a little fresher, everything tasted like it had been sitting awhile and store-bought. My friend had the Greek Salad with the Gyro meat, the Gyro meat appeared to be from a package and thrown on the rill for about 2 to 3 mins. very thing, looked like processed food. he got maybe 2 slices, it was okay. nothing special. Granted it was fast food, every that being said it is still expensive for a fast food joint with the quality of food not there and cold pitas out of the box. Staff was nice. I probably would not go there again as I much rather go to other places like Pita Jungle at Happy hour and get better quality of food for about the same price. There is also a place in phoenix off of 7th street that makes their own falafel and it is fantastic, nice spices and fresh for about the same price. You did get a lot for your money but again I would prefer quality over quantity.",0.0
"Overall this is just an A-OK buffet on the strip; I truly believe that there is almost always an equal sign (=) in between the quality of food and the price tag.

I don't think I will come back unless I get to eat here free of charge and do not have to wait in line at all, which is too good to be true, isn't it? teeheee :P

"A group of 4 of us were on a double date and was actually planning to go to another restaurant but was compelled by the nice ambience of this restaurant. This would soon prove to be a mistake.

For starters we got the tempura cauliflower and the duck pate. The tempura was just as it sounds - Nothing special. The duck pate came with a few pieces of cracker like toast which was much too hard for the stiff pate which would break when you try to spread it which is probably why they didn't bother to give us an adequate of toast to go with the pate.

3 of us had the Duck and Carbonara, 1 had the lamb and beans. Unfortunately we found it quite disappointing. The carbonara was slightly bland and the duck still had a lot of fat on it which should've been rendered longer. The lamb had an unusual smokey flavour which bordered to tasting burnt. Overall the meal itself wasn't that bad but for the price you pay, it's really not worth it. There are way better options.

First, the pedicures are thorough, but I end up bleeding on the bottom of my feet every time because he does not know how to remove the callous correctly.

Who by far has the worst customer service. When trying to get a hold of a general manager was only referred to a sales manager. Who said the same crap that my warranty would not cover my issue of the car. This is my first experience with a chevy and last. I have always had a honda. No issues there. I just wanted to support an American made car but in the end was screwed. There is a recall on my car. I will switch back to a honda when I get a chance. PLEASE DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. Please go somewhere else!! If you still want a chevy go another one that will treat u with more respect. Sales team will promise u everything but once u sign u are on your own. I'm still waiting to get my issue resolved. No manager has responded back to help me. Called a different chevy dealership with better service.,0.0

"We decided to live up to our hype of being open-minded and try something unique to Phoenix (i.e., not Mexican; not Vietnamese; not Chinese; etc.).  And that's how we ended up at El Chullo; though, to be fair, we almost DIDN'T end up at El Chullo's.  A previous reviewers comment about parking being limited is like saying Marlon Brando was slightly overweight towards the end.  Let's just say, the parking lot is shared with other businesses; the ""lot"" is about one car wide; and one has to do fancy gyrations to park and withdraw one's car IF one can get a spot.  After driving around three times, we parked in the printing shop's lot across the street (which, I'm sure, will thrill them to no end when\/if they read this).  Go during the standard 9 to 5 business hours and you may find yourself outta luck or risking a tow.

Alas, the parking spots are not the only thing small about El Chullo.  In fact, ""small"" pretty much describes it all:  the parking. the restaurant, the portions.  I was rather amused (bemused) by the comment from one of the reviewers that the portions are ""very large"".  Really?  VERY large?  Perhaps for someone who survived  internment at Sherrif Joe's Tent City or who usually dines on those diet programs' pre-packaged food (served in upscale concentration camps).  Granted, this is not to say that the portions were pretentiously small like a la carte francais food; they were perfectly acceptably sized for people, who eat like they're supposed to  (translation:  non-Americans).  We, however, are of the MOO crowd, so for us, all of dinner was something akin to ""snack"".  (Hey, I workout, get off my case!).

We started out with the appetizer platter for $14.95 and chose the Chicken Causa Rell; the Papa Rellena; and the Papa ala Huancaina.  Presented very artistically, I would not say it was an appetizer for two AMERICANS.  Taste was quite good and unique, though the standout taste was potato (hardly a surprise since ""papa"" means 'potato').

I had a very spicy cerviche mixto and my other half, the escabeche de pollo.  Both very good -- the latter served with rice and a small portion of cold, sweet potato -- but we weren't exactly unbuckling our belts at meal's end.  Again, like I said:  not small, but not big by the usual, middle-class American standards, where the men are men, eat like men, and doctors buy brand new cars every month with all the money they get from bypass and pacemaker surgeries.  Nuff said.

The diet Inka Cola, colored like Mountain Dew but tasting like cream soda, is good, but $2.00 a can?  For both of us, the bill came to $46.41 without tip.  Not tragic, but a bit overboard for the quantity.  Maybe reasonable considering the uniqueness of the food.  The 20% tip for Omar, however, was well in line.  Attentive service without being overbearing and very accommodating.  That's one thing I really can't make any complaints about (and as you see, I have no issue complaining).

- No free recharging! The wall sockets are limited to those that are ""pay per charge"" and are very expensive.
- Very limited selection of shops pre-checkin and NONE that are open at night. 
- It gets insanely cold at night.. the cold air blows into the building itself and really really chills down the pre-checkin area!

Great menu for HOT Chinese food.
Didn't serve great portions to the choice of Sichuan style dry pot that we ordered. In fact there were 5 times more other stuff than chunks of chicken, which serves as the meat element of the main dish. 
Size and stomach-stuffing ability is generally not great, excluding sushi, which is sadly about the same everywhere.
Sushi was decent, but not as excellent as the price tag would justify, at least for some of the selections.
Overall selection of food category is great, very comprehensive.
Food is on average 3.5 out of 5 authentic to the corresponding Chinese provincial styles, which is already somewhat of a rare bird in the Pittsburgh area.

"Popeye's has always been one of my favorite chicken places in general. The lieutenant colonel and the one with the church name are somewhat on the bland side and are not my first choices for tasty chicken. 

This location has a few things to complain about. The neighborhood is not the best and it shares the same building with the Circle jerk guys next door. Usually find myself trying to get in and out rather quickly. The customers are always pretty loud and obnoxious and the place is not very clean. You might even be asked for money in the parking lot.

Service is basically poor and trying to communicate is difficult and a bit tricky. Normally have to repeat myself a few times to get the order correct. On my last visit experienced a triple sneeze by the cook right on my meal. Gesundheit!

Usually order the Spicy Chicken with a side of Beans and Rice. Can't resist getting several jalapenos to give the meal some additional kick. Sometimes I'll even go crazy and order one of the specials. Tried the Catfish on my last visit and was surprised how small it looked. Maybe they should just call it kitten fish?

Definitely recommend going to one of their full service restaurants that do not commingle with one of those fast trip places. Once had the occasion to eat in a really industrial part of Baton Rouge and enjoyed the meal so much more than this place. WHAT THE CLUCK?

"Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   

I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.

We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  

When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)
 
After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. 

The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.

No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school\/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).

FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.

I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.

Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   

First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.

"It's a pretty packed place, however, the service here is friendly, fast (it's a very go-go-go type atmosphere), and attentive (they kept refilling tea constantly). Don't think it's the best Korean food in Mississauga (in my heart that title goes to Buk Chang Soon Tofu on Hurontario and some other local joints on Dundas St), but definitely offers a lot of variety and satisfies my craving. 

Their specialty is Kamjatang (pork bone soup) as others mentioned, however I did not try this! I saw someone order Kalbi and it looked good!

I ordered Ramen ($5.99) and Japchae (~$8?) to share. I liked the Japchae, and the portion was pretty big too which is good for sharing. The ramen was fine in flavour (not as spicy as I thought) - the pot was a bit shallow and so the portion was smaller than I expected. Interesting that it says it has beef dumplings, but when it came, I only saw 1 beef DUMPLING (singular). 

It's not expensive, but I think there is a slight markup compared to some other Korean places (ie. Kamjatang is $7.99 compared to maybe $5.99 at local joints). However, if you're in the area and crave Korean (and there's not too much of a wait), I would say this restaurant has enough variety to keep you happy, especially in the cold winter months.",0.0

first of all, I moved downtown from mississauga and was used to cheaper prices for biogel refill\/overlay.

They do not use any filing machines here so everything was done manually with a nail file. While I admire the effort that is put into this, after two hours i was still not finished and did not have time for the drying and massage part of the service.

"So it seems that the owner of this business is just as unprofessional as her employees!
After my conversation with them on Wednesday, today I received a call from Jennifer and a voicemail that was largely sarcastic in tone, as well as unapologetic for her employee's behavior. Also in the voicemail was her distaste for my yelp review that she called ""harsh"". She does say ""I apologize"" at one point in a tone and verbiage that is clearly an ""I'm sorry, I'm not sorry"".

""Hi Rae, this is Jennifer with Jennifer's catering... I would love to chat with you.

Jennifer ends the message by leaving her number and an extremely curt ""Thank you"".

The only reason you have my information is because I gave it your staff member before I realized what kind of a company I was dealing with.

I'd also like to add, if you had called and were actually professional, apologetic and genuinely concerned about ""very large problem"" & the poor experience I had in the first place, instead of your yelp reviews, I would have gladly changed\/amended it to say that you called and cared.

"I used this company for a recent windshield replacement when I noticed that my windshield had developed a significant crack after traveling from PA to Lakewood, OH.  I had a mixed experience since everybody I dealt with at this company was pleasant and helpful and in the end they did get my windshield replaced, but their process was pretty complicated.  Here's the timeline of what happened as I remember it:
1)  I call my insurance company about the crack to see if it's covered.  Turns out it is at least partially covered so they refer me to a couple of glass replacers that are supposed to be in the West Side of Cleveland area.  After the first name on the insurance company's list turns out to be in Cincinnati instead, I go with Glass Doctor because I'm being told they have a Lakewood location - but I later find out they don't, and are doing everything out of their location on Carnegie Av which is still local but not near Lakewood.  This isn't a huge deal but did mean that I wouldn't be able to drive to Glass Doctor safely for the replacement as the windshield might fall out in that travel distance, so they would have to do the replacement in my Lakewood driveway.

2)  I make an appointment for the Glass Doctor tech to come out and replace my windshield.  The appointment seems to be made via some central call center at the 1-800 number rather than by just calling the garage itself.  I also get told it will take a few days as they have to order a windshield for my car (which is 2 years old and a popular model of car, nothing unusual so I don't quite understand why it will take days, but whatever).  They can't give me an exact appointment, just a time window when the tech will come. 

3)  A day or so before the appointment, I called Glass Doctor back to make sure the appointment is all in order as I need to drive the car back to PA soon and can't drive any distance with a big spreading crack in the windshield.  This time I get a different rep who tells me the first rep gave me some incorrect information about when the tech would call me, when he would arrive, etc.  and also may not have entered everything in the computer properly, so we have to work for about 15 minutes on correcting whatever it was that the previous rep didn't handle correctly.

4)  At this point I determine that the windshield they have ordered is plain glass whereas the one actually in my car that came with the car package I got is considered ""decorative glass"" because it has a little one inch black border around the edge.  I was asked previously whether I wanted ""decorative glass"" which costs more, but had no idea what they were talking about and asked them to please order the appropriate part for my car, model and package (which again is a pretty popular model and package, nothing weird).  So the appointment now has to be rescheduled so they can order a windshield that looks like the one they are replacing.  I am willing to take some blame for not knowing what ""decorative glass"" was, but most of us calling for service are not experts about car parts...

5)  Several days later they have the ""decorative glass"" in hand and the tech calls me first thing that morning to tell me when he's showing up.  The problem now is, it's raining and the windshield adhesive can't set up in the rain, so if I don't have a garage available to do this in, the appointment needs to be rescheduled again.  At this point it's been days since I've been able to drive the car more than a few blocks and the crack is continuing to spread...driving to Carnegie facility is not an option as it's too far away...and like many people in Lakewood, I don't have access to a garage or carport - my car is parked in an open driveway.  So, we reschedule. Again. 

6)  Fortunately on the rescheduled day it is not raining so the tech, who is a nice pleasant fellow, is finally able to come to my driveway in Lakewood, change out my windshield and collect the payment check. 

7)  About a week later, while I am on vacation in the middle of a dinner party with a dozen dear friends, I get a robocall out of the blue wanting to collect feedback on my Glass Doctor experience by having me answer a phone survey.  I end up handing the phone to my friend who has had several pints of beer and he says a few choice words and hangs up.  Seriously...you want feedback, please send me an e-mail survey link and I'll fill it out on my own time.  Don't call me in the middle of my vacation and dinner! 

I can't help but compare this whole process to what happened when my husband in a different state and with a different insurance company had his windshield break on the way to work.  Within a day, somebody came right to his work parking lot and swapped out the windshield of his van on the spot.  His car was not out of action for days, he didn't need to talk to multiple reps, and he didn't need to wait days for a tech.  Not sure why it was so different for me.",0.0

"Restaurant review
In my quest to find good BBQ in Champaign outside of BlackDog which I still have not had a chance to eat at due to the long lines, I ended up at Bobo's with carry out. First the food takes a bit of time to prepare even though I was only 1 of 2 customers. I took heed to avoid the mac and cheese as it was reported to be similar to box mac and cheese. My sides were fries which are skin on potato fries, good not very crunchy but tasty and the potato salad which tasted like run of the mill potato salad. The corn bread was crumbly and dry so not so good. And on to the meats, pulled pork and beef brisket. There was not really any strong smoky flavor. The portion size was ridiculously small. For 13 dollars you can see how much food I got in the container. The only redeeming value was the delicious BBQ sauce. The chiptole peach and mild sauce were amazing BBQ sauce with a delicate balance of spiciness and sweetness. The only downside is you get only 2 small containers for the sauce. If you want any more you have to pay extra.

"I called to get more information regarding my husbands traffic ticket. I spoke with a nice guy who explained the process. He asked me his name and what it was for. I explained it was a traffic ticket on the freeway in a construction zone. He told me he couldn't find the ticket in the system and to call back with a citation number. He also explained to me their cost is between 75-120.00 for them to take care of it and they can also do everything over the phone.

I later called back and spoked with a very rude employee and I told her I had the citation number so they can quote me approximately how much the ticket would be. She asked me what it was for etc. and I explained the situation to her just like I did with the person I spoke with not even 5 minutes before her. She informed me the ticket would NOT be 75.00-120.00 but it would be between 300-400 dollars! She also said that we would have to EMAIL our ticket over and they would e-mail us a contract back. 

This is a classic example of two employees not knowing what the hell they're doing. I don't care who was right and who was wrong someone should not call into a business to get TWO completely different stories within 5 minutes of each other. The amount she quoted me wouldn't even save me any money it would actually be about the same in court if we did it on our own! I'm highly disappointed and I will NEVER be using ticket busters because it seems like they have incompetent staff.",0.0

The issue: Friend and I watched appalled as a cockroach crawled around the restaurant floor for a bit, until it made its way under our table. My friend trapped the roach between her empty glass and a menu, and politely called our waiter over. My friend very politely explained the situation to our waiter, and requested that he take care of the bug. He replied with something to the effect of, ""I don't know what you want *me* to do about it. I don't really like bugs either. I've never had a customer do this before."" We proposed multiple solutions, including getting a dustpan or taking the captive roach to the front door and releasing him. He declined both options, opting to have my friend carry the glass, roach, and menu to the door herself, while he graciously held it open for her. She sat down, even more appalled, as the waiter walked away.

After agreeing that the service was unacceptable, my friend addressed the waiter as he brought us our check, mentioning that he should taken care of the bug next time. He took the criticism with a face plastered with offense, and stumbled over his words as he seemed to hold back greater emotions: ""I... I will... Take that note and keep that in the back of my mind."" We payed our bill and left promptly.

"We went to Arribas for Christmas dinner.  There was a 30min wait even though the place was about 40% empty.  People that were waiting started seating themselves at open booths in the bar even they it wasn't open seating.  When one person complained about it they were immediately seated at another open booth.  Being the chump that I am and having a party of 6 we waiting patiently.  I ran over to CVS to get a snack for the wait.

We were finally seated new an area that was closed off and near several empty and set tables while others waiting to be seated.  Our server only had 2-3 tables but was gone from the floor for long stretches.  It took over 10 min to get our drinks (probably more like 15).  

The food took at least 45min (although the guacamole came out fairly quickly).  I had the chicken breast plate.  The chicken was nicely seasons, the rice was ok, the bean portion was very small.  My wife's fajitas were good but the veggies were incinerated.  the kids enjoyed their tacos, salsa, bean dip and guac.  I tried a couple of the house beers but they didn't impress me.  My wife had a 99c margarita and liked it.  

While my wife was using the bathroom a waitress came in crying.  I can only guess that the kitchen was understaffed so they held people back to keep from flooding it.  The food was decent and there are other things on the menu I would like to try, so we may be back again, but not at Christmas.",0.0
"Sorry, I see some ""rave"" reviews but this place was not even up to ""Dive"" standard for me.  I had been by this place, read reviews, was so excited to try it and finally got a chance to go in and eat...so excited...and then, SO DISAPPOINTED! Went there during a Diamond Back's game, no one in there except one gentleman sitting at the barstool waiting for his order.  Got in there around 1:12 p.m., and we didn't get our food until 2:20. So wanted to leave but we felt uncomfortable leaving when we had already ordered, I had waited so long to try it and we were the only one's in there for the last half hour...awkward.  We could not believe it took over an hour to get our food, AGAIN, we were the only one's in there for over a half hour! We ordered the chicken and it came with two sides and a piece of cornbread. The cornbread was so dry my 9 year old niece almost choked trying to force done a small bite.  I didn't believe her so I tried, it was so dry I put it down without finishing; note to restaurant, YOU CANNOT microwave corn bread back to life!  I will say this, I did finish it only because I was waiting over an an hour for food...it became a ""eat in hunger desperation"" thing.  

Once the food finally came, and AGAIN, still the only customers (that should have been my tipoff...UGH), it was not impressive.  The chicken was nothing special, nothing.  I make better at home.  The side of Mac n'Cheese was good and thank goodness something was good...not great, just good.  I had the green beans, again nothing worth remarking that another restaurant could not do.  I don't know if it was just because I was so hungry or whatever, I ate all my green beans and Mac.  Nothing spectacular, and nothing I will ever go back for.  

Service was horrible, they were not even ashamed of the crap service, didn't even bother to give us another piece of dry-arsed corn bread and only checked on us once.  I went, I ate and was NOT impressed.  

Go, judge for yourself.  Sadly, I know you will probably be disappointed.  You will have an appreciation for the expression ""Meh.""  They are over-priced and over hyped.  Glad I got it out of my system.  I could give them more than 1 star but that would be dishonest.",0.0

Really hoping for more as we live close and the area is in need of a nice tavern\/sports bar\/eatery but for now they are missing the mark.  For a Tavern their beer selection is lacking especially with only 4\/6 beers on draft. For a potential sports bar they should have left more in the budget for larger TV's\/sound. As far as a health conscious eatery although their paper menu offers promising options we found the healthful sides similar to the taste of garnish and would leave anyone curious about veggies to stick to the fries.,0.0

"Very disappointed with he billing staff that represent Dr. Beals. My daughter went in for her wisdom teeth to be pulled back in June. The surgery went fine and truly like the Dr. Beals bed side manners, however the billing staff follows unethical billing procedures especially when the Dr. Is a in network contracted with insurance company. 
I have 2 insurances one through me and one through my husband insurance. I only had 200.00(approximately) on my primary insurance once that's used they don't secondary bill. I paid cash 1,500 out of pocket(paid in full), however after the first 200.00 dollars were billed to my primary, my secondary become primary. Again they still didn't want to bill the secondary (even though it now my primary)so I did all work to submit to my husbands insurance. Interesting thing my ""secondary"" submitted payment directly to them even thought they were paid in full by me. They had no problem taking a secondary insurance payment that should have been paid directly to me( funny because remember ""they don't deal with secondary insurance) Dr. Beals office kept the checks and only made a payment to me 531.36. Far from the 1100 dollars my secondary insurance sent to them.( which again if they don't deal with secondary insurance why would they even cash the check that don't belong to thee first place) they are double dipping between his patients and the insurance company.  This is against his contract and insurance fraud. The office believes by them not submitting tok secondary they do not have to follow their obligation of reducing there fees to the agreed discounted contracted amount.
I called the office today after I called my insurance company and again confirmed that they are not following the contract Dr. Beals signed with them to be an in network provider.  I have one more child who needs wisdom teeth pulled and base on this experience I will never recommend anyone to use Dr. Beals. It's not worth the 6 months worth of hassle to get monies owed to me returned. Stay away from his office if you financially don't want to be ripped off. Called my insurance company were they will take over and appeal how the doctors office is misconducting there billing practices. I believe at this time, I will also be calling 3 on your side and put pressure on them from from their unethical and fraudulent bill practices.  Please  going to this office if you financially don't want to be screw by the ignorance and fraudulent billing practices. It is beyond frustrating and not worth the hassle.  This whole experience has made  me sick to my stomach and beyond frustrated.

My only reservation in awarding three, and not more, stars is in the pace of the service. I wanted my juice drink to go, and although there was only one other table occupied in the restaurant, I waited nearly a full 20 minutes for my juice to be made and me to pay. So, moral of the story, as long as you don't expect to be anywhere in a hurry, go here. You'll likely enjoy the meal. Me... I liked what I got, but I was late for my appointment because of the wait.",0.0
"We had to wait around 20 minutes for a table in the bar area which was no big deal.  The hostess says, ""We have a reservation here in about an hour and a half.  Do you think you could be out of here by then?""  My first mistake was to reply yes.  It made me and my guests feel like we were just another party to be moved along as quickly as possible.  I let it go and we sat to enjoy the nice evening.  

After about 20 minutes I was getting upset that a waiter\/waitress hadn't even said anything to us, especially since they were trying to ""move us along"".  I had to go up to the hostess and let her know that no one had even acknowledged us.  Finally the waitress came over and took our order.

"First time in Las Vegas, so we decided to give this place a try since we're staying at Stratosphere. The calamari was sub-par, the bacon wrapped shrimp was only okay. Neither offered any taste. The ribs looked amazing but it was way too sweet to swallow. The seafood fettuccini was the worst! It was so fishy to the point that it was inedible. When we asked the waiter about it, he said that the dish is normally fishy like that, which would've been nice to know before we ordered it. The shrimp scampi was probably the best dish we ordered. However, it looked like a child's meal with 4 shrimp and barely a handful of rice. The salmon fillets still had bones inside, but other than that, taste was okay. Service was great, but that was about the only positive thing I can say about this restaurant. We should've taken the hint when there were only about 5 tables there when we walked in.",0.0

"Here's the SpaceQuest Bar in a nutshell:

* A quick and easy dance floor tacked down onto the pre-existing carpet.
* A quick and easy stage cobbled together for playing music or booty dancers.
* Random, mismatched tables, chairs, and couches pulled out of storage and plopped together to make this seem like a ""lounge"".
* A quick and easy giant, temporary curtain placed to shoddily cover up the multi-million attraction that was the primary basis of this area.
* Bathrooms that still have video screens that wheeze out the original sci-fi shtick from 15 years ago, but now the voices are strained, and the videos cycle lazily out of focus when they are not going to a blank, white ""Video"" screen.

Six years ago, Star Trek: The Experience closed down, which was arguably THE biggest draw the Hilton\/LVH had outside of being adjacent to the city's Convention Center.

Since then, the place has sat like a shell-like monument to the old place.  I understand that it's a big space and needs to be filled, but since 2008, it looks and remains a cheap and temporary placeholder in its construction.  It's an odd combination of this well-detailed space theme crumbling and falling apart due to age and neglect coupled with a set-up that may as well have been constructed by a child with cardboard boxes and bedsheets covering chairs.

SpaceQuest Bar needs to figure out what to do with itself, as after six years, they still don't get it.  The place looks like a graveyard.  Either accept that the place looks like a giant space station, clean it up and run with the theme, or suck it up and remodel the place into a functional lounge that's actually nice, and not comprised of temporary and mismatched pieces.  The ""Star Trek"" vibe still runs too strongly through the place, and trying to pass it off as something else is as ridiculous as losing the attraction itself (or losing the ""Hilton"" name, for that matter).

I inquired about the type of apples on one of the salads and I'm told red and green.
I'm tired of ordering food and the employees knowing nothing about what they're selling.  No clue how many ounces in the beverages, no idea the weight of meat on a sandwich or what toppings are on it so they have to put you on 'hold"" so they can ask someone else.

It took a while for anyone to greet us when our group of 4 came in for a scheduled bridesmaid appointment on a Tuesday evening. We signed in and were told we could freely look at the dresses on the floor and someone would be by to help us out. Went through, picked out a bunch, and..no one came. Literally had to hunt someone down before we got some help and settled into the dressing rooms.

Then came the fine print as we were close to finalizing a Vera Wang option in the ~$200 range:

I offered to hold the table with a credit card, but he assured me that it was not necessary as he was placing my name on the list.

I get that things happens, but I think the problem was that the manager seemed put out by the fact that I asked her to take my plate away. I had only had one or two of the ribs on the rack and they didn't replace the plate...I assumed they'd at least take the rib dinner off the bill being that they threw majority of it in the trash. Instead I get a $5 discount with an uber tacky memo reading ""hair in pot""...I'll go to outback next time.

It began with the rep not even showing up on the day we had booked. We called the company AFTER they had missed their appointment (6pm-9pm) to find out they over booked and won't be able to come. Frustrating yes, but things happen so we rescheduled for the next day. 
When the rep arrived he had the audacity to charge the exorbitant price of $280 for the ""labour"" which consisted of the him spending approximately 20 minutes looking into the problem.(Note: I had signed an agreement of 280 labour + parts. My fiancée, who was not home at the time was told on the phone $95\/h for labour, which I found out after the fact) His conclusion from this ""thorough"" investigation was a that a part was broken and in need of replacing. He said he would call us tomorrow with a price for the part.
Tomorrow came and went without a phone call. My fiancée finally had to call back since they still had not contacted us. After finding out they wanted $900 for the replacement part, we demanded the money on the unspent labour back to which the rep told us ""Its your fault, you signed the agreement"" .

"WORST EYE VISIT EXPERIENCE EVER!!!! This staff, ran under some creepy looking Robert guy, needs all of their eyes checked. A good lesson in customer service, satisfaction and retention. First off, they'll fill any prescription but, not any frame. This was told to me, after, they drained me for a hundred dollars for a contact exam. The staff was poorly educated in eye care. They had no knowledge of a soft\/hard contact lens. The sink had no contact catcher. The lobby was filthy... I thought about walking out but, it was close to home. Bad move and I deeply regret it.

"My Parents are retired, honest seniors, that have always loved driving Hondas.  They have been saving for a while and have had their eye on the CRV.  Well the day finally came for them on 12\/5\/14.  My Dad, is a very modest man.  He's quite frugal, especially when it comes to buying a new car.  No need for all the bells and whistles! Everyone knows that Dealership Salesmen and Business Managers are pushy and pushy until they get that sale.  They treat you nice, crack jokes, the works....to get that sale.  The Business Manager makes that sale happen.  If you don't qualify by having a credit union, no worries, a Costco card works too. No worries, they will make your payment the number you want.  My Dad was asked if he wanted the extra warranty, he said ""NO"".  He was asked about a few other extras, my Dad said ""NO"".  But they will make it work! Finally...Contract signed, sealed papers delivered in hand. A few days later, my Dad is at the insurance company and notices that he after saying ""NO"" to the Vehicle Contract, was still charged $2200.00.  Also, a theft deterrent system was charged, but not installed for $995.00. That is a lot of money for my parents, even if it's broken down to monthly payments.  They are seniors on a very tight fixed budget.  I think the worst part of this is, the attitude and denial when speaking to the Business Manager, CORY CALDARAZZO and the Salesman, Michael Douglas.  I personally called to speak to Cory on the phone and told him that their had been a mistake.  He first said, "" Well, I can't make changes with you over the phone because you are not on the contract.  You can come in so that we can fix things and take care of it.""  My husband ended up leaving work early from Scottsdale, to meet my parents at the dealership and to speak with Cory.  Well, it turns out Cory is just a BULLSHITER! Their is absolutely nothing they can do at the dealership to make changes. It was just a HUGE waste of time.  What aggravates me the most, is that my Parents are in their 70's, spent the entire day worried sick, then left the dealership very upset.  That isn't the way to treat Seniors or just plain PEOPLE!  Why can't they just be HONEST from the beginning and earn their money the right way.  I'm very upset and disappointed that my parents have had the JOY of a new car ripped out from under them.

"I suppose I'm taking out my disdain on Las Vegas itself - it is certainly not for me.  Depressingly trashy and full of boring chain restaurants, I don't understand why anyone would waste vacation time here.  We were on our way to Zion and Bryce Canyon and had to fly into the hell-hole known as Las Vegas.  We initially booked two nights because we'd never been, and we were both ready to leave by the morning.  Thank God that Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam were nearby.

That being said, Treasure Island the hotel itself was nice and cheap.  They probably hate people like me, who get a $40 room and are expected to make up the difference by gambling hundreds of dollars.  No thanks.  They do up-charge for WIFI, etc.  The rooms were upscale and beds were luxuriously comfortable.  The hotel has everything that you could expect at a hotel in Vegas- robots sitting at slot machines with a lit cigarette, a cheap drink, and permanent frowns plastered on their face.  It also had cheesy places like ""Kahunaville"" and ""Senor Frogs"" in the bottom of the hotel.  Having heard glorious things about buffets in Vegas, we had to check out the one at Treasure Island.

"On 2\/3\/2014, my wife and I visited Sands Kia to purchase a 2014 Kia Rio LX with automatic transmission.  We came to the dealership with a Guaranteed Savings Certificate issued by Sands Kia that guaranteed that we would ""save at least $1,847 off a base MSRP of $15,000 on any in-stock 2014 Kia Rio Sedan LX Automatic vehicle.""   The Certificate named George Burten (gburten@sandskia.com) as the contact person and (623) 474-3344 as his telephone number.
In advance of visiting the dealership, we researched the online inventory of all Kia Rio LX's with automatic transmission, including the hatchback version.  We identified a sedan version with the color and interior we wanted but were prepared to accept other exterior colors\/interior colors based on currently available inventory.  All of the inventory was listed under separate pages so every car could be identified by its lot number and VIN number.  That page listed the MSRP and Internet Price and a button for a Sale Price.  That page also made clear that  ""All prices and payments plus tax, title, license, and $499.50 doc fee.""  In other words, there was nothing to be added to the prices shown beyond tax, title, license and doc feel.
Upon arrival, we were greeted by salesman ""AJ"" and advised that we were there to buy a Kia Rio LX Automatic and that we were to ask for George Burten.  AJ advised that George Burten was not in but that he would help us.  The first Kia Rio LX sedan that was our first choice had been sold.  We were then taken to view the existing inventory and selected a hatchback model which had VIN #: KNADM5A39E6348019 and Stock #40747.  The sticker on the vehicle showed that it matched the MSRP of the Guaranteed Savings Certificate except for the addition of floor mats, which was acceptable to us.  There were no supplemental stickers on the Kia Rio we were interested in.
When we stated that we wanted to obtain the out-the-door price so we could obtain a cashier's check from our credit union, the salesman (AJ) was shut out of the process and replaced by a supervisory or managerial employee who came back with a worksheet that added $200 for ""etch"".  We advised this employee that the car had no such item appearing on any sticker on the car.  Besides, we pointed out that the only thing the website stated would  be added  to the price were tax, title, license and doc fee and that ""etch"" were none of those.  The supervisory employee stated he could not remove the $200 charge for ""etch"" but he would talk to his manager about increasing the Guaranteed Savings by $200 to counteract this added charge.  After a wait, we were  told  that the  $200 charge for etch would not be removed.
We notified the supervisor that what he (or his manager) did was an unfair and deceptive business practice under Arizona law and that by trying to add this charge, Sands Kia was engaging in false and deceptive advertising.  The supervisor's only response was:  ""Do you want to walk away over $200?""
My answer to that supervisor and his manager is that I did not walk away over $200.  I walked away because I do not think that customers should be subjected to false promises, unfair business practices and deceptive advertising.
Note:  Neither the salesman, AJ, nor the contact person, George Burten, played any part in this scheme.  This was done intentionally solely by those higher up the management chain of Sands Kia.
I have filed a complaint with the Consumer Division of the Arizona Attorney General's Office.  I am also writing this review to warn unwary customers of these business practices.

I woke up today 12\/26\/2014 to find my water heater pouring water out of the cold water inlet. I called Old Republic who is my home warranty company and they set me up with VETERANS PLUMBING & DRAIN LLC. 

Being a Veteran myself I was happy that these guys were going to fix my problem...little did I realize.

The first issue was the tech was supposed to call me 30 minutes prior to coming, I have a 2 1\/2 year old son and two large dogs that bark if someone rings the doorbell so this is fairly important to me. While my son was napping I hear repeated rings from my doorbell which caused my dogs to bark which then woke my son up. 

Once the tech made it to the water heater he looks at it for about 20 seconds, doesn't ask what is wrong, doesn't try to diagnose the problem, NOTHING. He goes out to his truck to make a phone call and tells me that he is going to replace the tank but a few things aren't covered by my warranty, which comes to roughly $250 on top of the $60 service fee. 

After I declined paying that much he then asks me for my $60 service fee, which I inform him that I do not have to pay to him. I called up Old Republic myself to verify this and by this point he tells me ""don't worry about it, ill just write down that the customer refused to pay"" to which I agreed. 


Once the tech left I decided to get someone from Old Republic on the phone and let them know what had happened. The lady who I spoke with told me that the tech had also told them that my water heater was more than 10 years old and it needed to be replaced regardless. I informed the lady that my water heater is only 3 years old.

"Ladies, ladies, please pass on this garage. It is the stereotypical garage attempting to take advantage of  single women. January 27, 2014 I took my car in for inspection. I was told that the alternator belt would need to be replaced at a cost of $180, very expensive for alternator belt replacement. I said that sounds high, I will wait. I took my car to a different garage, Tuffy Fort Mill today, 11\/13\/14 (almost ten months later!) for an oil change. The alternator belt is still fine. Woodies-Carmel Rd. also replaced a part in my key fobs, at $56 on 1\/27\/14, and neither worked , even after returning a second time. I had to ask them to refund my $56. A very dishonest business.

First off, their pizza is good.  Especially, when you consider that out of the dozens of stand-alone pizza shops in Las Vegas, not many of them are that impressive.  This place is.

Second, their prices are decent.  We usually partake of the lunch special where you can get two slices of cheese pizza and a can of soda for $3.99.  I think that's a pretty great deal considering that the two slices are HUGE.

However, their customer service is so bad, it's non-existent.  The first time my co-workers and I went to this place, at noon, to get lunch, the open sign was off and the doors were locked.  We waited about ten minutes and somebody finally pulled up and seemed annoyed that there were people waiting to be let in.  That annoyed me.  If they happen to get an order wrong (which happens far too often as their English isn't that great) they go to EXTREME lengths to convince the customer that it was their fault and not the other way around.

"I went in there because I really needed a hair cut for school pictures the next day. The girl that checked me in didn't know how to work the computer, or the credit card machine. When I mentioned a defuser for my bleached blonde she was confused about what I was talking about!!! When she cut my long blonde hair she wet it down and then took half an inch off and re-layered it. I paid and left with it wet which was odd to me. I went grocery shopping and when I got home it was dry and my hair looked like a hack job! It was not blended and it looked like a kid at cut it. It wasn't even and you could see the obvious layers and cutting lines!!! I was pissed. I went back in to get it fixed the next day and thank God Rachel was there and she styled and fixed it. She had to take off another half inch of my hair so that it would blend, that's how bad it was cut the night before by the other girl. It took her over an hour to fix it. While I was there I watched a lady with purple hair cut three other people's hair, she washed their hair and cut it wet and didn't even dry it!! I'm sure their hair didn't turn out!

"It seems people have very low standards of what a good wrap should be. This place is all flare and presentation without any substance. Cutting corners and skimping in the most important place- the food- does not a successful business make. I have no doubt that the owners know they are getting away with packing their wraps with cheap filler (lettuce, tomato) and putting a minimal amount of meat in there.  

I had the pulled pork wrap and there was barely any pork in it- just a sliver. The volume of the wrap comes from lettuce and the pork is hardly even visible. This is a disgrace regardless of the prices they charge. My friend's chicken wrap was the same. This kind of typical short sighted approach is a cancer for any business. Owners try to save a few dollars by getting away with the minimum. It is cheap and disappointing- furthermore it takes the customer as a fool. Granted, most people are not discerning but those that have been exposed to the many options in North America  and businesses that value their customers are discriminating enough to see immediately that these wraps are a scam. They are unsubstantial and over-priced and worst of all, the owners know it and don't care because as long as people buy they don't have to offer any value. I won't be back and I'll be sure to tell everyone I know not to waste their time and money. Restaurants don't deserve success when they short change their customers and take them for idiots. Put some substance in the wraps and take some pride in your business.  I am sorry to say, places like this are a stain on the Montreal food scene. Get out and travel and you'll see you this kind of product wouldn't be acceptable anywhere else. If the owners know anything about food and have ever left Montreal, they know exactly what I am talking about but are counting on the ignorance of their customers.",0.0
"Port Authority of Allegheny County employs some very, very bad drivers.

I will call the Port Authority in a few minutes to lodge my complaint; however, I wanted to lodge it here too for two reasons. First, the complaint bears on the Port Authority's ability to keep its riders safe (because the driver almost caused an accident, which could have resulted in injuries to the riders of the bus). Second, if this driver causes an accident in the future, I hope this complaint will help injured parties make a case for negligent retention or negligent supervision against the Port Authority.",0.0

"Dear Noodle Cat,

I had such high hopes for you. Such high hopes that I kept coming back with the hope that perhaps that last time I went was a fluke. But no. This time, it was the donabe. The miso overwhelmed the entire dish. It tasted like I was drinking liquid salt. Perhaps the bland vegetables exacerbated the whole affair (zucchini--in your case very over boiled zucchini-- in miso soup is never a palatable option, in my opinion). The way your vinegar infused rice (really? I can barely stand it in maki-zushi and now I have to deal with a whole un-adorned mound on my plate?) is crammed ever so indelicately into a yunomi really didn't help the situation.

The tofu-coconut-veggie-curry...or was that spicey water? And the eggplant nasu miso, a favorite Japanese dish of mine, was utterly ruined by overcooked rice, and a very sub-par combination of miso and very badly done mushroom. 

One positive thing: your steamed buns are to die for. Every time I've had them, they've been delicious. The buns soft, chewy, the inside meat\/tofu beautifully done. The display wonderful. Perhaps you should just stick to your steamed buns.

For example, the Kung Pao Shrimp was not fried as it is supposed to be and doughy. My family always orders this dish in various locations and this was by far the worst. 

Delay and food preparations aside, what really sets me off is that I not only waited 45 min to receive my food (altogether the preparation time was well over 60min), I have received nothing from the management as an apology but plenty of negative attitude.

 Maybe I am spoiled but in every P.F. Changs I have been so far, I have received a credit on the bill or a voucher if something is off. This time I have received nothing (only a half hearted apology of the manager).

I had the pappardelle ($19).  To be honest, it kind of sucked.  The proportions were off (oddly enough, not enough pasta and too much sauce) and the sausage that they were using seemed to be high-quality, but ill suited for the dish.  It was bland when it needed to be robust.  It came with what seemed to be  a huge ball of ricotta, but it seemed to just melt in and away quickly, adding very little to the dish.  On the whole, this dish  really could have used some more flavor, if even just some more salt.

"This was our second try at eating here. This place has a great location and I love pizza so we thought we would grab some dinner after a movie. The first time was pretty bad, the woman didn't know what to do with our coupon, so it took forever to order. We had a pitcher of beer (not a good selection on tap) and waited for our pizza. About twenty minutes later she brings some wings to our table because she completely forgot about our pizza. It was nice that she brought us some complimentary wings, but when the pizza finally came out it was burned and incredibly greasy. 

We decided to give the place one more shot. The second time we got there and it was not busy at all, but it took a while before anyone came to the counter to take our order.  We ordered a couple of beers from the bottles they had on display only to find that they didn't have any and we were stuck with the two tap choices again. It took about 30 minutes to get our pizza. It looked like it was cooked well, but it was incredibly greasy again and the dough was rock hard. We will definitely not be going back.",0.0

Poor quality con queso, tastes like out of a jar.  A manager came by our table and we asked if they reduced their portion sizes.

"Not sure what all the fuss is about. I did not enjoy this place. This is a typical ""authentic"" Mexican style restaurant named after a person (you know, Roberto's, Laurita's, Pepe's, Beto's) with ""authentic"" meaning the flour tortillas are semi transparent due to being grilled in lard. I ordered a Machaca Torta, but they gave me a Jamon y Huevo Torta. The torta bread was blackened in places which did not add to the flavor - but detracted from it. The egg was too brown too. Basically, not a good sandwich at all. My wife ordered the #8 (2 Tacos) but got a #9 (Burrito and enchilada). So, it would have been nice to get what we ordered. The cheese in the enchilada was very odd, like thin spaghetti. It retained that shape even after heating. The enchilada sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The fries were plentiful and good however. Overall, I will not go there again. I think every one of this type of Mexican restaurant get the pictures of their combination plates from the same place.",0.0

Of course this place is beautiful. They spent zillions to make it so. That's not the point. You don't go to a venue to look at the walls. You go for the show.

We saw Lewis Black at the Orpheum last night, and all I can do is give honest impressions.

When we first walked in, the entire place smelled like a fart. You get used to it, but it doesn't go away.

Although the bathroom facility was clean and somewhat spacious, there is ONE MEN'S ROOM & ONE LADIES ROOM, woefully inadequate for the size of the crowd. In fact, unless you have fortunate seating or sprint to the bathroom at the intermission, the line forms so quickly, you risk not making it back to your seat for the main event. We saw several people being ushered to their seats after Lewis Black hit the stage.

$7 for a 12oz can (Yes, CAN poured into a plastic cup), of Budweiser is just ridiculous. I understand you pay a premium price for refreshments at entertainment venues, but even the D-Backs, Cardinals, and trendy Scottsdale Night Clubs don't charge that much.

We sat in the 14th row of the orchestra section, what would be considered pretty good seats by most people's standards. We probably missed out on 1\/3 of what was said due to horrible acoustics. If you know Lewis Black, you know that being able to hear him should never be a problem. Suffice to say, I have perfect hearing, and it wasn't just us. Throughout the show I could hear people asking their companions, ""what did he say?"" Only to be answered with a shoulder shrug. I don't know if they sound check an empty theatre, or at all for a comedian, and I'd bet things are different for amplified music, but it sure was frustrating struggling to hear one of my favorite comedians.

I'm glad the Orpheum is back and enjoying it's run, and things like the restroom situation can obviously never be changed (Gammage is waaaay worse, by the way), but if the sound thing isn't at least tweeked a little, they will only ever be an ""ALSO RAN"" venue in the Valley.",0.0

There are both high and low tables, as well as booths. Nice decor, sleek and relaxing. Nice looking bar. There is a divider wall to a space in the back for a more private party or a big group, or just more seats when busy. They have a good-sized patio facing Warner & there is landscaping that prevents feeling like one is sitting on the road.

Wine of the day was a nice enough Italian, enjoyed the Yelp check-in 50% off a glass of it. The manager did a good job of suggesting another glass that matched our tastes when described. Was really hoping she would continue as our server, she was great both on the phone and in person (Shannon). Alas, not to be the case...

They seem to have some nice happy hour deals, not crazy, but enough to make a dent in the bill (we didn't come during hh but the prices are on the menu alongside the regular prices).

Our waiter is a young-looking guy with big, dark hipster glasses. He was friendly, but scattered. Had to return 3 times to ask us Qs about our order, later explaining he had too many table orders in his head at the time he took ours, didn't write it down, thought he had it. We didn't care, but I was a server for a long time, and it's just ... not... good. Yes, people will judge your service based on this sort of thing. They feel more doubt that they are actually going to be looked out for during their meal... Well anyway, it made him seem inexperienced. Our water sat empty a couple of times too. He was an okay server, not amazing, but at least he was nice. 

SAD - looking forward to those rosemary sweet potato fries and they are GONE!! NO LONGER ON THE MENU! If only I hadn't seen the Yelp photo, I'd never know what we will now miss.

From the time we ordered our meal, it's a good thing we were talking and enjoying the music, because although I didn't time it, it really did take longer than what is typical. Although it didn't bother me, I recall at one point thinking, ""Okay, this is definitely outside the bounds of 'normal' wait time for food."" 

Husband got a cheeseburger (options are ""pink or no pink), I got a glazed salmon special. We both chose to substitute a side-salad for the fries & rice (respectively). He said burger was fine, nothing wrong with it. The ""side salad"" was a small enough pile of field greens on our plates with our entree that my husband asked the waiter, ""Is... this... the salad?""  He wasn't being rude or smart-ass, it really was unclear, as it was that small of a pile. It looked like a garnish.

My salmon was cooked nicely, moist. However, the rosemary-something glaze had me concerned. It was carmelized I suppose? so that when I first tried to fork into the salmon, it seemed tough. Fortunately, it was the glaze, not the fish. Maybe it was meant to be this way as some culinary twist; I didn't enjoy it & left me thinking it was a mistake. For me the glaze was too sweet without a tang or savory to balance it. I dipped it into their balsamic dressing meant for my salad & it was better. When the very nice manager asked how we liked everything, I was politely honest, I figure they could use the feedback since it was the ""special.""

As we left, we agreed that we really wanted to LOVE this place. We LIKE it. We would return during happy hour for a little nosh, or just for a glass of wine and a chat.

"This was a pretty good buffet.  We got there around 5 so just before dinner time rush.  It is a kind of weird set up where you wait in line to buy the buffet then get into another line to wait to be seated.  All in all took us 10-15 minutes to be seated.  The buffet is separated by region.  There is Italian, Mexican, soup, salad, Greek, seafood and dessert.  There was some good food and some not so good food but all in all it was tasty.  The service was pretty slow but they only had one server covering a large area. At one point a server and bus boy were having an argument and management had to come out and take care of it.  They handled everything right out on the floor which I thought was neither the time not place for that right next to our table.",0.0

"I wish there was a way to give none to negative stars. I had the most horrendous move of my life. Let me begin...
I had scheduled the movers over the phone with the owner, ""Sam"". I had explained to Sam everything that was in my small 2 bedroom apartment. Told him no stairs, and only a few heavy items (bed, dresser, TV and TV stand). I asked about if there would be any extra, or ""hidden"" charges given what I had told him and also given the fact that 90% of my apartment was going into storage first and then the rest of the items were going to be taken to a house up the street from the storage facility. He told me no. He told me the moving price would be $35 an hour plus $35 for the trip fee and then 22% of entire bill for the gas fee. NOTHING MORE. 
I agreed at those prices and set up the move for 5PM, Friday the 27th. 
5:30 rolls around the day of the move. No movers no phone call. So I called ""Sam"".  No answer. Called again. No answer so I left a message. He calls a little while later saying the movers are on the way. 6:30...7...no movers. Finally I got another phone call saying they were almost here. They finally pulled in around 7:20. I know because I checked my phone records and got the call from them saying they were almost there at 7:18pm. 
Upon coming in, one guy starts looking around. I don't know his name but it starts with M, I believe. Or so I was told, but more on that later. Anyway, he hands me the moving contract and now all of a sudden they're wanting to charge me $40\/hour + a 26% gas fee. I told him no. That's not what Sam told me the prices were. He went outside for a minute and came back with the old totals scratched out and a new total of $35.99\/hr and he said they would do the 22% gas. I reluctantly agreed and told him ok and to start. He told me ""it won't be more than $250"". I said ok. 
They finished loading the truck around 9:45ish-10pm. I actually didn't even realize they were done loading until I stopped cleaning for a second to notice I hadn't heard or seen anyone in a while. I go outside and see them sitting\/standing by the truck. I asked if they were done. Was told yes so I told them to follow me to the storage facility. 
They told me they had to stop at a gas station first to fill the take. WHAT KIND OF MOVING COMPANY DOESN'T FILL THE TRUCKS TANK BEFORE A JOB?!? So now they're taking time that I have to pay them for to do something they should have done before arriving. 
It took them almost 40 minutes to get to the storage facility that should have only been a 15-20 min trip. When I try to pull in, I realized the storage gates close at 9pm (although on my paperwork it says they're 24 hours). So now I have a truck filled with my entire life and nowhere to put it. I start freaking out and telling them had they not been 2 hours late and had they not taken 40 mins to drive there we could have made it. The guy by the name of ""M-something"" turned it on me saying it was my fault and that it takes 4 hours to load the truck (really? You started at 7:30 and was done by about 9:30...my math is a little rusty but I don't think that's 4 hours). Anyway I got really upset and started crying. The other guy with him, Anthony, said he would take the items going to the house, over to the house and if I had a lock, I could lock the truck and then they would come back in the morning. I said fine. I told them that I still wanted to talk to the owner that I booked everything with, ""Sam"". Anthony then points to ""Mr. M"" and says ""this is Sam."" At this point I'm so confused cause I heard the guy say his name earlier and it started with an M. Anthony was lying. 
They took the items to my house and left what was going to storage on the truck and told me they would meet me back at storage at 10am. 
Fast forward to next day...it's 10am. Guess who isn't there? The movers. They said they tried to call me twice, which I did see 2 missed calls but so sorry I wasn't able to immediately jump to the phone.
They finally arrived half an hour late. I let them in the gate and we get to my storage unit. ""Mr. M"" brings me the contract which is now $378. I asked what the hell was going on. He told me they charged me for shrink wrap (I didn't ask for it), they charged me also for the extra stop to the storage which I told him when I booked with ""Sam"" I specifically asked if there would be an extra charge to drop most the stuff off at storage first. I was told no and now all of a sudden it's an extra charge.  I sat there getting upset telling them they're lying about everything and I told them I wanted to speak to the owner. They kept telling me that the owner was unavailable on weekends and that there was nothing they could do and they were in charge.

"Dont waste your time or money by coming to this mall.

I used to work here as a teen, and I clearly recall how it used to be.  Very busy, every store filled with customers, an great food court with lots of tasty lunch and snack options.  All the ""big name stores"" where there, it was really the place to be, no matter your level of income

It had to be in the early 1990's when I can pinpoint when the mall began to decline.  I believe it had to do with a combination of the more affluent customers surrounding the area moved away to larger homes, and the then owner of the mall, Westcor, raised rents so high that many shops could not afford to stay in business.  Throw in the downturn in the economy, and you get this leftover of a mall.

Now, all you see are generic stores and shops geared towards hispanic clientele, like ""joyerias"" (jewerly shops) and other random budget-type of shops.  There is one wing of the mall that is completely dark and empty, it is a little creepy.  The only decent stores left are Sears, Victoria's Secret, and Macy's, which I am sure is only a matter of time before they too will close.  I was at the Victoria's Secret to use a gift card here the other day and went into the fitting room and it was filthy.  I really dont think anyone there even cares anymore.  I also asked to smell a certain type of perfume and they said if it wasnt out there, someone probably stole it.  Just shows you the type of people who go to this mall.  I was also in Macy's and while the staff there seemed nice, they just dont have anything to do except follow you around.  I dont like to feel rushed or like I'm being watched as I shop, so I just left!  Even the bigger stores that once surrounded the mall-Old Navy, Best Buy, they have also left.  Nothing left but large vacant stores.  If you've been to Fiesta Mall, I would compare it to that, but worse.

The mall did undergo a renovation in the recent past.  However, it did not produce the intended consequences, as it is still mostly empty and people are shopping at other newer centers.  The best thing that probably came out of that renovation was a new and improved city bus station that sits adjacent to the mall where all you see are the thuggish wannabes or pregnant teens hitching a bus ride to their dr. appt.  It is sad when I think back to the better days of this mall, but I guess with all things in life, nothing good lasts forever.

He was very nice & attentive. He did mention he just started working so he was kind of clueless with the cocktail menus as well as the foods but I won't hold that against him!

For the foods--  this place is at the bottom of my list of tapas foods. We ordered..
Mango chicken -- nothing special about it looked like grilled chicken in mango salsa. 
Stuffed dates -- The dates were so big! & was wrapped in a small size bacon that didn't match the portion size of the dates.
Crab cake -- this was pretty delicious but the presentation of the dish wasn't appealing. When it came out it looked like a burger patty swimming in sauce. 
Buffalo wings-- nothing to say there it's wings lol 
Ceviche -- it was pretty good. The chips looked like it came outta a bag that you buy at the super market.
Meatball sliders -- meatballs were midget size compared to the bun. Tasted bland.

Cocktails & wine-- got the job done. They weren't terrible. 

Overall, I probably will not be returning. Me and friend did have fun there but we have fun anywhere really. Lol",0.0
"Another one of those places that I would've assumed that I've reviewed... but I haven't!  There's not really much to say in terms of reviewing the only supermarket in Charlotte that has Korean food. 

The one note I wanted to drop here was for fellow shoppers - bring your own canvas grocery bags.  It's like the cashiers have a quota or something to use up as many plastic bags as possible!  No jokes - you bought eggs? Separate bag.  Oh you bought a bottle of sake?  Separate bag.  You bought packaged noodles?  Separate bag.  It's such a waste.

The last time I stayed at Caesar's a couple of years ago, we got one of their older\/non-remodeled rooms, and it was small and not so great.

"False Advertising!

I went to the store this week to take advantage of the ""Buy Two Rings, Get the Third One Free."" I read the fine print online and the only caveat was that the deal was good  in the store only. When I visited the store, they told me that the sale only applied to rings currently in stock in that store. The fine print on the marketing material in the store was written different from the online advertising, which I'm assuming was their intent to get us into the store. 

To add insult to injury, they had NO size 9 rings in the Chandler or San Tan stores. They normally have a large inventory, but it looks like there were very few rings in other sizes as well. It makes you wonder if they're hiding the inventory in the storage room in the back.

"Way over priced. Very poor service. The ribeye ""steak"" is a simple breakfast steak that is very thin and they couldn't say how many ounces it was because ""they cut them themselves"". Maybe 5 ounces at most at the price of 12. And whatever seasoning they added ruined a ribeye's natural flavor. We won't go back though we were really hoping it would be good.

"Ce petit restaurant non loin de chez moi m'intriguait. J'ai aimé découvrir la cuisine Perce, surtout avec les explications du chef lui-même. Sympathique, accueil très courtois et service chaleureux. Mon amie et moi avons pris le plat pour deux qui vient avec salade ou soupe et un thé. La nourriture était excellente. Juste une petite déception pour la soupe qui me semblait plus prometteuse en saveurs (question de goût, car mon amie a adoré). L'ambiance est apaisante et la musique est au choix du tenancier (tous les styles y jouent). Côté propreté, je n'ai rien à dire. Pour la modique somme de 45$, pourboire inclus, nous nous sommes régalés. J'espère que le menu va évoluer pour offrir plus de choix dans le futur, car on le parcourt très vite.",0.0
"This place is deceptively spacious. From the street, it looks like a small little hole-in-the-wall coffee shop, but inside the room goes on and on! 

I've come to Le Placard a number of times, because it's the nearest place to my house that's guaranteed a cheap cup of coffee and an open electrical outlet for my laptop. That said, I don't love it here. The decor is quirky antique-store chic, which I love, but the large space is somehow overly impersonal. You get a feeling like you're really all alone in there. Hard to quantify, but there you go.

The coffee is okay, often not as hot as I'd like, and the muffins were a little disappointing. I haven't been brave enough to try anything else on the menu. Service here is sort of crummy, though. It's like the place can't decide whether it's counter service or table service. They have you sit down and they come to take your order, but then good luck ever seeing a server again - not for a bill, not for a refill or a glass of water, not to ask if you want anything else. Which is too bad, because I'd like to hunker down and work in one place for a while, not wonder if I should go to the bar or try waving my arms frantically to get someone's attention.

They use Ile sans fil wifi, which works most of the time, and there are plugs everywhere, so if you're going to work, you should be ok. And an article plastered to the front window boasts, ""comme au bureau,"" so they sort of expect you to set up desk there. It's good enough for what it is, but unless it's crazy cold out, I prefer to walk a bit further for better.

"I want to like this place more.  The inside has a nice warm atmosphere.  I know a lot of chinese restauraunts are trying to cover more asian cuisine than just chinese.  I got the Pad Thai.  I also know that good Pad Thai only comes from a good Thai restaurant.  This Pad Thai was close to being really good.  It was very heavy on the noodles, I like noodles, but it was missing the crunch of the sprouts, they were very few.  It was very sweet with very little spice even though I asked for extra hot.  It was not terrible, I'm guessing Thai dishes are not the strong dishes to get.  I plan to return to try something else, probably sushi or a roll of some kind.",0.0

"Franklin House is always crowded so they must have something good to offer.
Perhaps the patio is nice, and it's good for a drink, but the patio was full and we ended up inside. It was cramped, there were only 3 or 4 other people inside, but it was terrible. We were seated off the bar, between the kitchen door and the door out to the patio. The music was so loud we could not hold a conversation. They did not have the beer I like, or my second, or even my third choice. The waitress was not overly friendly, but she was. What made this such a terrible experience aside from the atmosphere was the food. We ordered flat bread appetizer, cheese and bacon, and it was not good, no flavour, sorta dry and bland. For dinner, I ordered stuffed yorkshire pudding. What little bit of actual roast that was in there was dry, definitely reheated from frozen. The yorkshire pudding itself was gummy and tough, the vegetables tasted reheated and bland. My companion ordered a burger and fries, and the fries were awful, soggy, no seasoning, tasted like they had been fried in old oil, and the burger was dry and had no flavour. Our bill for 2 beer, and 2 meals and the flat bread was almost 60 dollars. We left and went to Burrito Boyz and got something else as we were still hungry.",0.0

First, the good: omg the baked goat cheese. OMG THE GOAT CHEESE. The cheese was warm, soft, and served swimming in tomato sauce. It was served with warm garlic bread, and my biggest joy in life is garlic bread dripping with cheese and delicious sauce. It was a little bit of nirvana for dinner. Unfortunately, it maybe set the bar a little high for the rest of the meal, because it didn't live up to the first course. 

We also had the warm brie. I love a cheese plate served with hazelnuts, so that was the high point. Unfortunately, the croutons were dry and hard. I ended up skipping the croutons it came with and eating regular bread with it, and enjoyed that more. 

I had the half portion of mussels and the frites. I didn't love the frites because they were hard and overly crunchy with no real potato in them. I dug around in the basket to see if there were better ones, but nope. All overcooked and shriveled. Even dipped in the broth from my mussels, they were a difficult, flavorless side, and I didn't eat many of them. The mussels themselves were pretty good, and it was served in a basic, lemony wine sauce. 

Mon Ami Gabi bills itself as a steakhouse, and several people in our party did get steaks and they enjoyed them. I didn't try it, so I can't speak to those, but maybe they're more proficient at their main attraction. 

We were celebrating a couple of birthdays, so they served Profiteroles with sparkler candles. They were festive, but not incredibly delicious. Then again, I always have high expectations for French pastry, and maybe that's not fair for a place sitting literally in the shadow of a replica Eiffel Tower on the Vegas strip.

"I give five stars for the food and two stars for the service which I guess averages my rating out to around three and a half, so since yelp doesn't allow half stars and the service was really an experience ruiner for us, I'm downgrading my rating to a three, which is really disappointing that bad service can ruin a delicious meal this much. 

So let me start with the food. Hub's and i had spent the last week hiking our butts off in some of the nearby national parks and wanted to treat ourselves to a delicious steak dinner and since we'd been meaning to try Cut for a number of months now and could never manage to get a reservation we decided it was time to pre-plan and give it a go. The food was mouthwatering - a choice of warm breads to start (my favorite was the pretzel bread), the appetizer, steak tartare, served with a quail egg and mustard, was so amazing we fought over who got the last bite! Our entrees, fillet mignon's for the both of us, were cooked to perfection and accompanied by creamy wild mushrooms and fingerling potatoes with large chunks of smokey bacon  - to die for!! 

Service was disappointing and at times rude and dismissive, bordering on offensive. Upon arrival (we had a reservation) the hostess ignored us, we were sat in the corner of the restaurant right next to the kitchen even though the restaurant had many empty tables and upon asking to be moved were told they could not accommodate us, our waiter was dismissive and inattentive and even forgot our order and had to return to us and ask us to repeat it, our sides were brought out quite a while before our steaks and were almost cold by the time our steaks arrived and to top it all off the table next to us was fawned over and provided very attentive service by the same server. Now, I don't expect perfect service everywhere I go but when your paying $400 for a dinner you expect the service to be at a certain level - after all, in restaurants such as this, your not just paying for the food, your paying for an experience.

Anyways, we went here a few days ago, just two adults looking for something different.  It was $10 for a wristband to get in and once we did it looked like an old deserted western town.  There were maybe 20 more people to come in after us and head to the saloon for the show.  Two staff members put on a few interactive, child friendly, old fashioned comedy skits for about an hour or so.
After the show we visited the ""petting zoo"", which is inappropriately named.  All of the animals there are caged and impossible to pet.  A few could even be heard growling and covered in flies and feces.  It really seems like this place is understaffed and underfunded, and could use some financial help and more volunteers.
The stores are full of cute old-western knick-knacks, most of which come with a lovely ""made in China"" sticker.

They informed me that since I didn't secure our reservation with a credit card that we, in fact, didn't have one.  The person I spoke with on the phone was not helpful and very rude.

Pairs that my son did like were all in the ""smooth"" leather, which are very difficult to break in.  Heck, we're both STILL trying to break in pairs of smooth leather that we got in December.  So we said no to anything in that material...at least until we're finished breaking in the ones we've already got.

The staff were sort of helpful.  They looked in their stockroom for the pewter boots, but when they didn't find his size, they did not offer to order them or find out if they even make them in the proper size.  (I found out later that they apparently don't.)  I asked for tips on breaking in smooth leather, and one person suggested we leave them in the car to get them warm, then massage the stiff areas.  

We moved on to shoe care products.  The two clerks were having a conversation, and we had to interrupt them a few times to ask our questions and make selections.  It was kind of funny that when my son mentioned he could use a new brush, they pulled out a shoe care kit that contained none of the products we mentioned we were looking for.

In the end, we didn't walk out of the store with new Docs, but we did get some new laces, and new care products that we needed.  Will we be back?   Dunno.  At this point we order our Docs from either the DM website or Amazon.  It's nice to have a store in Arizona, but it's too far out of our way, and not enough selection to go very often.",0.0
"The food here was quite medicore. The congee was watery though the fritter that came with it was quite good. The shiu mai was bland but large. The beef balls tasted funny. The rice rolls with shrimp and vegetable was awful.. it was just really bland. Lastly, the beef and black pepper buns were bland. Almost everything needed salt added to it! The only dish I fully enjoyed was the stick rice and that's really hard to get wrong. Still the service is quick and polite and the venue is somewhat classy.",0.0

"This place won't last long.  Most the food is FROZEN and just heated up or maybe battered and deep fried. The place is EMPTY all the time. The kitchen doesn't care how a customer asked for the food to be cooked (medium for example is requested and they kill it 3x over and then step on it to make sure it comes out like cardboard) and the WAIT STAFF ARGUES with the customer telling them that is how its cooked.  Well, if that is how its cooked why didn't the wait staff SAY THAT from the start when the order was placed!  BURNT pizza is BLACK and the waiter is saying that is not burnt.  HA I was there one time before and the Pizza was perfectly light golden brown - not one ounce of BURNT spots on it.  The kitchen obviously doesn't know how to monitor & cook the food correctly.
Oh BTW, the manager was not in and the Head Chef was suppose to be in charge of the place!  Not once did he come out from his hiding place (the Kitchen) to address any of the matters.

I ordered a shredded beef burrito today for lunch through the drive thru and was disgustingly surprised to find that there were 3 leaves cooked into my burrito.

Went to this store because my galaxy s3 ear speaker is no longer working. And because I have a upgrade. But what they want me to pay for my upgrade is more expensive.  Than it would be to pay my phone insurence deductible. Which I have paid for the best insurance they have which means I am supposed to get a brand new never been used phone of equal or better if they dont have my exact phone in stock. And this company. Is trying to tell me. That they will replace my phone with a used phone. I pay the best insurance to get brand new not used or reconditioned. This complaint will be sent to Verizon corporate to let them know that I am not a happy customer and that this retailer is trying to screw long and loyal customers.

"Pretty happy with the one night stay, main because of the breakfast at Denny's. It wasn't a buffet you just got a couple basic menu items, but we had to pay for coffee. So I really wouldn't consider it free, it was more like 5 dollars plus tip. If you say you have 4 people in your room then you will get 4 vouchers, so you can get a substantial breakfast, but coffee should be free regardless.

The room was really basic but no complaints there. Saw plenty of security roaming the parking lost throughout our stay, so that was good too. We stayed on a weekday and they where pretty busy, cops busted a party a block down, so I'm assuming these happen pretty often at a cheap hotel such as this.

The only thing that really bugged me was that when we got settled in I left the door open to ventilate the normal bathroom smell of death from my grandpa. To my disappointment there was a employee spay painting an ac unit right outside our door. The combination of smells made for a miserable loss of brain cells.

"If you've ever been in need of furniture in a larger city, chances are you've heard of Ashley. It's a large chain of low\/mid-range furniture for all your home decor needs. It has a very typical home furnishing story layout, which is to say, kind of confusing. They try to set it up by making mini rooms throughout the store and you end up having to wander the entire massive complex in order to see everything of one type. For example, if you are looking for a bed, you'll have to traverse the entire cosmos in order to see the offerings. I'm sure the idea behind this is that they are trying to get you to buy more than one thing but it ends up translating to wasting a lot of time.

Ashley's furniture offerings aren't especially high quality but they do look nice. They are the type of pieces that will look good while they last but you should expect to replace them in a few short years. For most people this is fine. A lot of us can't afford to drop the cash required to get high end furniture. Their ""leather"" offerings are especially low quality (don't trust me on this, go touch and smell it and then do the same thing at Arhaus or Restoration Hardware).

The salesmen are a bit pushy so I'm assuming they work on commission. If you tell them that you aren't buying and are just looking then you'll probably never see them again. I find this type of salesmanship very obnoxious and shortsighted. 

I suppose Ashley is the right kind of store for a lot of people. I have purchased a few things from them in the past... but I'll admit that I always did it with a lump in my throat. In the end, you get what you pay for.",0.0

"I went here with a group of 11 people for my friend's birthday.  They did a good job at accommodating a large group, and the food was enjoyable.  The restaurant was not very busy on this Friday night, and our waiter knew the menu very well.  What was disappointing was our waiter's reaction to the fact that we all did not want a four-course meal.  When a few of us split a variety of small plates, his reaction was blatant disappointment and almost utter-shock.  It was very obnoxious.  Every single person at the table ordered at least two appetizers to split or an entree, as well as cocktails.  After ordering, we did not see our waiter for a while. Moreover, every single person I was with works for a large corporation based in the city.  Most of us get to select or suggest restaurants for work dinners.  Needless to say, Halcyon did not make it to the top of our list.

However, today I ended up waiting 49 mins just see a nurse for seriously what seemed like a minute. I needed one preventative shot and that was it. Cost me 49 mins and walking late into work.

"I spent 6 months here, and I never really had any ""serious"" issues. I originally signed a 12 month lease, but ended up moving out earlier because my job moved me to another city.  Here were some Pros and Cons during my 6 month stay:

Pros:

- The grounds are very well kept. There were always landscapers out working, the place looked great from the outside in.

- Great location. The neighborhood is a little suspect, but everything you need is 5 minutes away. Home Depot, Petsmart, Fry's, Target, Wal-Mart. You're close to the freeway and Sky Harbor is about 10 minutes away. This is probably the most convenient location to have for a pretty reasonable price.

- The floor plans were very spacious and nicely laid out. 

- I lived in one the buildings that faced out towards McDowell Road. This road is very busy all the time, and I never really had any issues with noise. However, if I opened the windows I would hear some traffic, but it wasn't bad. They also did a nice job with tree placement - every window in my apartment was surrounded by trees and it was really beautiful.

- No bug issues! I never had a problem with bugs of any sort...ever.

Cons:

- The complex is gated, however, the gates probably worked for 1 week out of the 6 months that I lived here.

- The parking situation is terrible. Each apartment has its own covered parking spot, but there are hardly any uncovered spots for guests. Also, people parked in my covered spot ALL the time. I had a corner spot, so not only did people park there overnight, but people would double park behind me and used that area to load\/unload things. The towing policy isn't effective at all, so when people parked in my spot there was really nothing I could do about it.

- The appliances are very old. In the 6 months that I lived there my dryer broke, the garbage disposal was broken the day I moved in, the bathroom sink had to be replaced and a piece in the shower had to be replaced so I could get hot water running through it. On the plus side, the Maintenance guys were awesome, and all of my issues were resolved within a couple of days. It took about 5 days to get my dryer fixed.

When I first moved in there were always police helicopters flying overhead, but that only lasted a few months. There's definitely a lot of ""rif-raff"" hanging around the complex and living there. I lived on the second floor and I had a horrible family living below me that made a lot of noise and played music so loud every night I thought a night club was on the other side of the wall. They also parked in my spot constantly.

The walls were pretty thin in the bathroom, and I could hear the person next to me taking showers and I always heard their AC click on and at one point their pipes were leaking so I could always hear the dripping. Sometimes I could hear talking and I heard someone sneeze once. This was only when I was standing in the bathroom, though.

I never had my car broken into, and I never heard any stories of it happening to anyone else while I was there.

The fire alarm was pulled one night at around 3am and it was terrible. 

All in all I would say I didn't hate it here, but I didn't love it here either. I never used the pool or the workout facility and I hardly ever went into the office or interacted with the management staff. If I had to move back there today I probably wouldn't.",0.0

Really... closed at 11 PM on a Friday night. Luxor you need to find someway to get people to go to that area above the casino floor it seems to be wasted space.

One of the biggest things that stand out was the renovation period when they hired contractors to pull the wooden slats that decorated the patio. The slats were gone in one day, but rusted nails and splintered wood covered the balcony for DAYS. Health hazard to the extreme. Also, at one point during the stay, I ended up having to put multiple pots and buckets underneath all the sprinklers because when it rained, water would leak from them. It was also rather sketchy that security guards spent most of the time in their cars in the back of the parking lot. Not surprising that I spent many nights watching squad cars roll in and out for burglaries.",0.0

"Well first time here been looking for a good Thai place on the farther west side. At first impressions the restaurant is very clean but also empty that sometimes concerns me.

I ordered the phad Thai and pot stickers as an starter. Tea was good but I like boba I know allot don't.

Besides the drinking, the food is nothing to get excited about. I'm personally not a big German food fan, so paying a high price for food I don't like isn't so appealing. I'm still shocked that a pretzel was $14. How much does it really cost to make a pretzel?! Yes it's large, but not big enough to justify the cost. And it tasted like every other pretzel.

Terrible service and small servings that are over priced. It was our first time and will no doubt be our last. The menu doesn't describe the dishes in detail like that something comes with mushrooms so if you don't like that there is no chance to have it taken off. When asked by the waiter to have them removed it took 3 times to get him to understand I wanted my meal simply without them.

It was indeed a neat date location for a Friday night. Good vibe, neon décor, online reservations, delicious tapa style dishes and a menu of tequila tastings.

What we ate (after the complimentary bucket of corn chips): 

Food:
1. Guacamole dip - $11 for a regular (6\/10)  - hard to do guac wrong but nothing to write home about, get it if you want an excuse to eat more corn chips

2. Sopes de tinga $15 (5\/10)- this appetizer was unique but the fried, breaded cheese tart overpowered the taste of the chicken

3. Tuna Ceviche $11 (7\/10) - fresh ahi tuna in a fantastic fusion of mango and cilantro, wanted another one because the portion size was not meant to be shared

4. Pulpo carnita $16 (8\/10) - well cooked confit of octopus, not too chewy or dry, exactly what you expect from a well cooked octopus

5. Carrillera en mole negro $15 (6\/10)- extremely tender, 24 hour braised beef cheek - however the tar looking sauce definitely requires an appreciative pallet 

Drinks: 
1. Mojito Reposada $10 glass  -perfect concoction of Milagro Resposado, muddled mint, and fresh lime - not usually a mojito drinker as I find they're often too sweet or the tequila is overpowering, but this was simply delicious

2. Tequilla tasting: Vertical Flight 1.3 oz - $19 -  Avion Silver \/ Avion Reposado \/ Avion Anejo - fun addition to the meal, however I'm by no means refined in the art of tequila tasting - all I can say is that they were smooth and worth the order


3. Tequilla tasting #2 - Barrel Aged Horizontal Flight - $22 - Tromba Anejo \/ Avion Anejo \/ Cazadores Anejo- ditto to my comment above - although I enjoyed this tasting a bit more as I found the tequila to be bolder and the neutralizing sides added some spice

Rating Summary: 

Food: Average of 7\/10 for the main courses as noted above

Atmosphere: 9\/10. Fun, posh Mexican vibe - definitely feeling the vibrant décor and music 

Service: 9\/10. The Spanish speaking servers add to the atmosphere. Our server had his corn chip service in check; our chip bucket was never empty. Service was difficult at times to wave down and we would've liked the staff to be more educated in the tequila being served.

"Very pleasant surprise.  This is an older apartment building (1960's I'm guessing) that has been converted to a hotel.  It's main purpose seems to be long term stays but they will also rent daily.

What you get; A clean, well kept apartment with full kitchen & dining room for a better price than ANY basic hotel room in the area.  While the building is old and apartments are sparse, very important to stress that they are clean, well kept, and well appointed.  Location is an excellent central Dorval location convenient to pretty much everything.  

PRO:

very comfy beds with lots of pillows
extremely affordable
clean
free parking
takes pets
great location
cable tv
full kitchen
balconies
sports bar, shopping, dining in walking distance
GREAT water pressure in shower
tons of closet space
excellent free wifi

CONS: 
typical older building minor noise issues (thin walls\/floors)

"To preface this review, I'm not an actual ""client"" here. I came in to purchase a gift card as a birthday present for someone and couldn't believe how terrible the customer service was.

We walk in and see two employees sitting at the front counter. We're rudely greeted by Janae who has nothing more to say then ""Checking in?"". I let her know we were actually there to purchase a gift card and she asks if the person we're buying the card for has been there before. I tell her that I don't believe so...so she goes on to look them up and says nothing more than ""nope"". Afterwards, she quickly rambles off two prices\/cards that are available for purchase. I'm not sure if that's all they offer but at this point, I was starting to get really irritated with her very apparent attitude and just hand her my card to ring us up for what I guess is the largest one they have at $75.

Now as I mentioned, there's another employee sitting at a second computer. Maybe I'm asking too much but even if you aren't currently helping us, at least be friendly and smile when you look at me. But for whatever reason, after the girl runs my card, he grabs the receipt and a pen and slams it on the counter. I sign the receipt, she hands me the card and neither of them say a single word. I'm standing there wondering if that means we're done or if I'm supposed to get further instruction, but nothing. So, I ask her if that's it and they both just say ""Yup"" while continuing to type away at their computers. 

It's a bit hard me to express in words exactly how these two acted but all I know is I left that place actually pissed off. That never happens and I honestly just couldn't believe it. This was a clear cut definition of terrible customer service for me. No friendly hellos, goodbyes and all the interaction is between, or lack there-of was terrible. It felt as if I was an inconvenience to them and for me, that's not cool. What's done is done but I'll never step foot in this business again. Now I just have to hope that the person we bought the gift card for enjoys themselves and doesn't have to put up with crap service like that.",0.0

"I knew going in to this the service at Ciao wine bar is not the greatest. I tried to pre-order my appetizers and offered to give my credit card over the phone, but they wouldn't let me. Darn. 

I arrived at 9:30 on friday and was seated at a table for ten and waited ten minutes but nobody came to take my order. I didn't want my guests to wait to eat, so I tracked down a server on the stairs and ordered a bunch of appetizers and platters. 

We had: 
The bruschetta - good sized portion. A bit on the garlicky side. 
The Buffalo mozzarella and tomato - This was great! Huge hunk of cheese.
The cheese platter - excellent mix of sweet and savoury. 
the Salumi platter - really spicy salami, which I like. I've had better prociutto.

"Most overrated restaurant in las vegas next to all the bobby flay bs. Hired model wannabe staff who are rude and stuck up. Service sucked but what would you expect from entitled wannabes. The food is a joke of different food channel concoctions and is at best a burger joint staffed with hotties.  Only foodie wannabes and has beens rate this high.  Most people say its great because of all the hype, the tv exposure, and to make themselves feel good about the dragged out long waits they had to endure for mediocrity and the painfully outrageous prices.

Only if you have money to spend big at once and then they will kiss your ass!

And it's not even a reasonable price either. And you stood there to helped promote their club for free and you didn't even get in! If they cut off the guest list line they should at least tell you right at the time they cut off, but they let you stand there for two hours to make them look busy. It's selfish and greedy cause the times you are wasting there you could have time to think about where you can go or find out another option for them. And staffs will ignore you completely if you act like you don't wanna pay for cover. I saw some people who were so excited about their night got turned down just like that. I meant tourists want to make their memorable nights but not all of them can afford to spend 5k or more in one night for only two people or couples. But maybe they can spend $500+ from buying small drinks at the bar for their friends or ladies. They are all assholes seriously! Me and my friends then left to XS who actually welcomed us better and the staffs at XS always have the best service! We can just use the cover fee money that we supposed to pay at Hakkasan buying drinks at XS and we even spend more than that. We had a great time so good that we decided to open bottle service that very night. We are not cheap but to discriminate people like that plus treating people like that, I need to spread the news to knowledge people how they will be treated and what to expect if they want to visit this place. You can go try this out yourself, and you will understand why I am so upset over this.

"I would have given no stars if I was able to.  I was completely tricked and mislead! 
I rented a car through air miles for a vehicle from Budget Sky Harbour Phoenix.  I was told that the only charge on my credit card was going to be the taxes.  When my son & I arrived we waited about an hour and when we got to the counter the woman said we are giving you an upgrade and I said ""oh, how nice!""  After giving my credit card and being asked about insurance I was asked to sign the signature pad so I did.  After arriving home my Visa was charged an extra almost $400.  We called airmiles and they looked into this for us.  She said the reason we were charged is because we agreed to a 3 level upgrade and rental of a Satellite radio system.  There was not one mention of any price increase or satellite radio, we never agreed to either of these charges.  We were going through airmiles to save some money.  When I signed the signature pad there was nothing for me to read I just signed my name having faith that Budget was not ripping me off!  When they sent me a copy of the contract there was not even initials beside these supposed upgrades that I agreed to.  It did have my signature under some small print (that I never saw on the signature pad) saying I had agreed to these 2 charges so they completely mislead me.  Not one word about paying anything extra!  Having gone back and forth with Budget, they are not budging at all on giving me my money back.  I was completely tricked and will never use Budget again.  This is the first time I have ever written a negative review.  Budget most definitely deserves this review so just be aware before signing.

"I was very excited for this show and sadly, even more disappointed. When you walk in, it looks like it will be amazing. The architecture looks like something out of disneyland, I took my seat and could hardly wait for the show to start; then, the show started.

Several members of the cast are out of sync which is highly distracting. During almost every scene you will see the entire cast which is present at that moment just standing still while a single performer does repetitive moves that are not entertaining for excess of 5 minutes. Randomly, some porn-star Tarzan enters the storyline for no apparent reason. Several of the scenes, different members of the cast would mess up, again, it was quite distracting. The room was too hot, they need to turn up the AC. There is an impressive dragon outside of the theater entrance but sadly, no dragon ever comes into the show. Wait, no, scratch that, if you like shadow puppets, you'll see a dragon for about a minute before some horrible fight scene occurs.

Everything about this show is outdated. The music is like a bad 80's rock style opera that has enticing highs and melodic lows. Honestly, the music was the best part. I found myself checking my watch multiple times, eager to leave and call it a night after that disappointment. 

For what you get, this show is extremely over priced. Trust me, don't go and waste your time or your money.

There is a scene (probably 30 minutes into the storyline) where a bright, hot white flash occurs. It blinded me for over five minutes and gave me a headache.

"IF YOU VALUE CLEANLINESS, DO NOT EAT HERE!

So, I went there tonight with my partner to grab a couple of rotis on the way home. We ordered two Vegetarian Delights and a tall, slim guy took our order (and money) then went to the back, presumably to pass the order on to the lady who seemed to be doing the food prep. 

The first indication that something might be amiss was when, a few seconds later, we could hear the beep of microwave buttons being depressed. Not a good start.

About a minute later we'd positioned ourselves at a section of the counter where we had a clear view of the stove\/griddle area and we could see the woman in the back flipping a roti wrap back and forth with a wooden paddle to heat it up prior to rolling. No problem there. 

THEN the guy who'd taken our order shows up next to her and starts chatting with her while simultaneously, and vigorously, scratching his neck, face and scalp! I was completely taken aback to see him doing this so close to the food, but was absolutely shocked when the woman finished heating and folding the wrap and the guy PICKED IT UP and took it off, out of sight, to another part of the kitchen! I immediately called the woman over and asked her if he was the one rolling our rotis. The response was yes, so I told her that we'd just finished watching her colleagues personal itch-fest, and that he hadn't washed his hands before handling our food. ""Oh, he washed when he came in the kitchen"", she said. I pointed out that, whether or not that was true (I doubt he washed up) he'd DEFINITELY not washed up after scratching himself all over. 

Needless to say, I immediately demanded a refund, and proceeded to explain to the guy why. He seemed a tad perplexed until I put it to him that he wouldn't appreciate someone doing that if they were preparing food for him.

"These people are dishonest, rude, and most of all potential identity thieves. I will never go here again, and neither should you.

I went in there late tonight, 12\/20\/2014,  a little bit before midnight. At first I was incredibly impressed by the cleanliness and drink station offered. I went ahead and got myself a slushy, a bag of chips, and a sandwich for dinner. Then I went to the cashier, Anna Z, who, as expected asked for my I.D. for my credit card. I take no issue with this, but I certainly have a problem with what she did afterwards. She took down my license number! When I told her that was inappropriate and I felt extremely uncomfortable with her taking my license number down she shrugged and said it was corporate policy. I told her that is extremely inappropriate and I want her to remove my licence number from both her little notepad and the receipt. I also told her that she should tell her direct managers and have it passed up the chain that, because of their corporate policy, I would not be returning. She, of course refused to remove the information. I then left, extremely distressed. 

I was so bothered by this that I turned my car around a couple miles down the road to go back. At this point I walked back in the store and could not even believe what I heard. The manager, Chris (would not provide his last name), was telling the cashier, ""He punched you in the face"" in a matter of fact tone. To which I asked if they were taking about me. Anna looked at me and told her that I made her cry and was very mean to her. I asked how she felt that I was that mean to her that she cried and she didn't respond and just gave me an angry look. I asked them to take my last four digits of my license number off of the receipt and they said, ""No. It's corporate policy."" Of course, with little recourse, I took their manager's information, Tammy, and left am angry and exasperated voicemail. I also recorded Chris telling me one more time that he would not remove my license number from the receipt. 

I don't know about any of you, but I'm concerned about my identity, especially with all of the hacks - Home Depot, Target, Sony... - and the complete and utter disregard by corporations for their customers' security and personal welfare. There is no reason that they should be taking a critical piece of information like my driver's license number that can be used to run credit and steal my identity. This, in addition to the personal insult and slander that the employees were coming up with, is disturbing and I'm not even sure of my recourse. I'm awaiting a call from the manager Tammy and will update this as appropriate. For now, I'm worried about my identity, feel violated that the information was taken without permission, and am embarrassed after having been falsely accused of physically attacking another individual.",0.0
"You know those people who add salt to everything? Like, hey, look at these salt covered corn chips ... they look like they could use at least 6 more shakes of salt on them. Don't forget the salsa! It probably needs more as well. Don't want to lose any precious salt when I dip the chip into it. 

I think that is the philosophy of Pizza People. The more salt the better. That's pretty much all I tasted. The food was so salty, my friend had four glasses of water with his meal. It was so salty, that 20 minutes later, when I saw a public drinking fountain, I about pushed my boyfriend out of the way to use it. I don't think I've ever been so excited to see a public water source. 

In case you are wondering, we all got some variation of mac & cheese. My friend raved about the mac & cheese pizza. He was so into it in fact, that he declared he would not be sharing because it just wasn't worth it. How can you not be interested after a statement like that? Instead of getting it on a pizza, though, I decided to order mac & cheese the old fashioned way. I just couldn't bring myself to eat it on top of a pizza. I mean, that is some serious shit. I already like food way too much. We don't need to get Morgan addicted to mac & cheese pizza. Sadly, though, the mac & cheese was not very good. Like I said, all I tasted was salt. My friend ended up letting me have a piece of his pizza for comparison, again, it was highly salted. Just a big disappointment. Nothing is a bigger turn off than overly salted food.

These were nice, but they arrived in less than two minutes from my order being placed, it seemed odd that they were this fast, hmm, but, I figured hey, I'm pressed for time so maybe it's my lucky day.

Before I was done with the first ones, mind you I am a fast eater especially since I was alone and not talking to anyone, came rest of my order and I moved onto California and Tuna rolls, this where the ship hit the iceberg.
The fish had a very odd\/bad taste, I was actually spitting out chunks of it that tasted bad and it was uneatable.
I tried to see if I could simply take the tuna out, this is when I discovered the fish was gooey and simply like a paste was smearing onto my chopsticks. 

Then I realized how they were able to manage such quick preparation times.

"I've only gone to this place once and overall wasn't really impressed.  

The only reason I went to this restaurant was because we were meeting friends.  Upon arriving they already had 2 Rolling Rocks on tap started and we sat down and eventually ordered drinks as well.  I ordered a Rolling Rock and my friend that came with me ordered another beer.

Our two friends that were already there said there was something wrong with the beer.  Neither had really drank too much of theirs, the most missing out of one of the glasses was maybe a little less than a quarter of the glass.

Upon receiving mine I tried it immediately and noticed that yes it didn't taste proper at all.  In fact is was sickly sweet and not what it should have been.  

We basically had our server come over and asked what could be done.  We were basically looking for new beers and for them to take these bad beers away.  It took quite a while before our server returned and we didn't get a real clear answer as to what they were going to do for us.  In our minds there was absolutely no way we were going to pay for beer that was spoiled or worse but also we wanted replacement orders as soon as we could as well.  

For some unknown reason it took a really long time to get this resolved.  Here you have 3 customers at a table of 4 telling you this beer is unacceptable and it was like pulling teeth to get this resolved...  we hadn't even gotten around to ordering food yet!

Eventually the answer came back that yes they would take these beers away as if we didn't order them and then we ordered new drinks.  It to me was something very simple which was complicated needlessly for no particular reason.  

I had ordered fish and chips which was ok, nothing out of the ordinary or nothing outstanding about it.  

What killed it for me was the entire bad beer ordeal.  If a customer is telling you there is something wrong please take it away immediately.  It shouldn't take upwards of 20 minutes to get something as simple as that resolved.  To me that was unacceptable.",0.0
"*****Just stop now and sign up for internet with any other company except Centurylink*****

Since May I have had subpar service with this company. I have called about 5 times to complain that I am only getting 5mb per second on all my devices. Every time I call, the person on the other end tells me that the service looks great on their end. They don't listen when I tell them that I am getting 5Mb on 3 devices and I should not have to reset the modem every two days like they tell me too. 
No one listens to what I need and it is a bunch of lies. Today, I called to cancel and Ginger (the rep) told me that I have a 12 month commitment. Mind you that I signed up for a no-contract service. She said that I owe $20 per month for the unused months (8 months left). She said that I could only cancel within the first 30 days. I let her know that I have called 5 times about the bad service. She cannot see the notes on her end and she is not linked to notes from technical issues. How can someone in retention not be able to see the history of the account to be able to get the full picture. 
Another lie and ploy to get you to sign up and make you pay even more when you want to cancel. 
I don't want much, I just want my devices to have more than 5Mb per second. I asked to speak to a supervisor and Ginger refused to transfer me. She said she can send an email and then hung up on me. Yes, she hung up on me. That is CenturyLink in a nutshell. Pull this call, 9\/26\/2014 at about 2:10pm and the rep name is Ginger. All I want is to leave. I don't want to do business with your company because you are shady and crooked. You cannot do business like this in 2014 and I will let every last human know to stay away. You cannot put NO CONTRACT on the front page of your website and then tell me I am in a 12 month ""commitment"". 
Please make it right. Not only for me but for future customers. 
1. Ginger cannot hang up on me even though I am an angry customer. I believe I called the retention number. Not only does she not help resolve an issue I have been having for months, she hangs up on me. She should be repremanded
2.  Change the wording on your website to either say 12 month contract or truly allow customer to cancel anytime under your no contract. No Contract- Is a lie. it is not called a contract but it is a 12 month commitment. (how funny does that sound and is it different to you and I). I called to cancel and I will have to pay  $20 per month for the unused months left in my ""commitment""
2. They throttle your service. You do not have the speed that you pay for. They will slow you down to a crawl if you use your service. 
3. The modem is the cheapest. When I signed up I was told that I had to use their modem\/WIFI. If you use any devices wirelessly, stay away from Centurylink. I sold my $200 WIFI with the latest technology to go with their $39 one.  The jokes on me.
4. You will not get the service you pay for and complaining will do absolutelynothing. Don't be sold on the price they give you.

Again, I just want to leave, I am unhappy because I pay for a service that I am not getting. All I ask is for you to honor we initially agreed upon. NO CONTRACT. It is simple, COX does it, Time Warner does too. When the customer does not want the service, we just part ways.",0.0

"This is the first time I've ever had broasted chicken and it tasted alright.

The chicken itself was very tender, juicy, and the skin was crispy. 

The only problem I had was that the chicken is not seasoned at all. I would love to come back here again, but I would really hope that the chicken had some flavour in it. It just seems like the chicken is breaded and then 'broasted' and then served. Not being seasoned once.

The man running the operation is a very nice guy, he talked to me while he was preparing the chicken (which is cooked to order) and overall his restaurant is very clean. 

A little too clean though, when I went inside the restaurant I got an overwhelming scent of bleach. Not that it affects the food, but if I had decided to stay and dine in the restaurant it would've become bothersome.

"Kind of like a more expensive chain breakfast\/lunch location, I wasn't too impressed with this Vegas cuisine. Also random that they served a separate set of Vietnamese food if you don't feel like eating American. Average price seemed to be around the 15$ range, which was way more than it should have been. I split one of the omelets, and it was served with toast and a heaping of hash browns. Hash browns were alright, not that crispy, a bit mushy. Omelet was okay, but I wasn't that excited about it.

"My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.

The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3\/5.

The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2\/5.

The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2\/5.

The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3\/5.

"I booked this because it was cheap and hey, who stays in their room for the majority of their Vegas stay anyway?? Yes, it IS cheap, FOR A REASON. First off, the rooms DO NOT COME WITH A COFFEE MAKER so you have to go downstairs and pay $3+ for a coffee EVERY MORNING. It is an old hotel, I will give it that. When we checked in, they asked us if we would like to upgrade our room for an extra $20 a night. We said sure. They put us on THE TOP floor (64 I believe), for the first two nights (we were there three nights from Wed-Sat), it was fine. We had an OK view of the strip, whatever. Friday night, however, was when the issue started. The lady who checked us in failed to mention that we would be RIGHT UNDER the penthouse which OFTEN has VERY LOUD private parties, so unless you plan on staying out all night long and not sleeping, expect to hear extremely loud annoying music right above your head. My husband first called the front desk and complained, asking if we could be switched rooms. They told him they can do anything BUT THAT (as if they were booked, which they obviously were not). They agreed to wave the upgrade and resort fees, saving us $120. He said fine. About 15 minutes later after more annoying music and loud thumping, we finally had enough - sleep would have been impossible even with ear plugs. This was about 2AM. He went downstairs to actually talk to the front desk people and finally managed to wrangle us another room for the night, so about 2:30AM we had to pack up everything and move a couple floors down. I'm not sure why they couldn't have done that in the first place but hey, at least we saved $120 in the end, even though that's about how much we ended up paying for coffee (kidding).

I have a standard Ford F150 extended cab short bed and when I turn to head into the tunnel their isn't enough space for me to get onto the track without backup up. Some dumb architect didn't layout the turning radius very well because I shouldn't have to back up to get onto the conveyor. I don't have that problem at other locations.

Until ownership steps up and starts putting money into their business I don't recommend this place unless you don't care about your paint job.

"Holy hell, what happened to this place?? This had been my go-to place for beans-and-rice Mexican in Madison for the better part of two decades, and I had converted my wife into a Pedro's fan. I'd had past or present Madison residents take issue with my insistence that Pedro's was a great casual dinner place, but I took that as part and parcel of Madison's legendary disdain for anything that's not edgy\/hip\/contemporary\/iconoclastic\/whatever. And old-school American-Mexican food is certainly none of the above, plus it represents one of the the greatest societal faux-pas of our time -- *gasp!* -- cultural appropriation! 

Unfortunately, it turns out any snobbery -- incidental or otherwise -- toward Pedro's may be warranted. My wife and I stopped in for the first time in 3 or 4 years and we were both sorely disappointed with our experience. The burrito is smaller than it used to be -- I suppose that's how they've been able to hold the line on prices so the size reduction is probably justified -- but my wife's fajitas were chewy, and both dishes lacked that ""kick"" that they used to have. Our quesadilla appetizer arrived luke-warm and was nearly rock-hard within minutes.

The premises haven't changed in the nearly 20 years I've been eating there and it's starting to show its age. Service was adequate, no more no less. which would be fine if everything else up to par.  In short, Pedro's lacks that extra spark that used to make it worth a special stop when visiting or passing through town. Not to mention the Mexican cuisine options have exploded in Madison in the last 20 years, so one would think Pedro's would need to step up their game rather than rest on their laurels. Looks like we'll be checking out the newer competitors on our next visit to Madison.",0.0
"You get what you pay for!

My experience was decent and considering what a bargain it was I am inclined to use them again! But what I did pay for was a good bit of extra waiting (and luckily missing even more). 

First waiting outside (uncovered) at the off-sight rental car plaza for a second shuttle to fox car lot. This was not so bad (or long ~10min) in April but come the summer . . .  Wednesday at noon was a good arrival time. When I got to fox car there were only 6 people in line and five representatives. It would have been faster if some people didn't have issues and only two representatives were getting through customers. The lot was full so I had a big selection of cars to choose from. However, on the return there was an additional line for people waiting to get a car (lot almost empty, 1pm sunday).

"I bookmarked this place a couple of weeks ago when the other location was featured as a ROTD- this location was by an upcoming work training, so I penciled it into my schedule and grabbed lunch here today.

Prior to going, I read the reviews and perused the online menu, ultimately deciding on the chicken shwarma plate- I'm a huge fan of the dish and it seems like few places get it right. When I heard another review mention the garlic sauce this one is served with, I thought for sure I'd found a new favorite place worth the drive. And the rather-high $12 price.

When I arrived today, I was distinctly underwhelmed.
Location was hard to find from the street- drove past it twice because the Stephano's part of the roadside sign does not stand out, and it is partnered with the word GYROS rather than the actual name of the restaurant itself.

But when I got in, I was the only one there, and the guy who took my order looked like he'd rather be anywhere else but in that restaurant. Order was taken with about 5ive total words spoken total. 

Order was out quick. Food was lukewarm, but plentiful. I still had hope.
Dug into the chicken and the quality was good, but the sauce I had so been looking forward to was a little runny and chalky- not at all what I wanted. Garlic flavor was very light, and the sauce seemed more like a tzatziki than anything else.  The salad was good, the hummus was okay and portions of everything were plentiful, which justified the $12 price. Pita was soft and warm, too, but a bit flavorless. But the chicken shwarma dish is just not what I'd hoped it would be.",0.0

"Went here for my brother's birthday and was really excited because I really enjoy going to places that try to step up the level of cooking and use unique ingredients. For the evening we chose the 7 course meal and I opted to do the foie gras upgrade which if you like foie gras, it's well worth it and out of this world. 

The early dining was well worth the price, not only does it give you a significant discount in price, but my family and I were able to enjoy each other's company without having to yell or talk over people since we were the first guests of the night.  We had all of our courses come out in a timely fashion catered to the pace of how we were eating. This place has a great atmosphere and really liked the concept.

Now onto the reason I didn't give this place 5 stars....
When you're first seated they hand you a list of ingredients and ask you to mark off the ones you do not want to enjoy, ask cooking temperatures of meat and fish and leave an area to leave any comments such as allergies. I'm a big foodie so I'm willing to eat everything and didn't mark a single thing other than temps. The one item I was really excited to have were the sweetbreads, unfortunately, I didn't receive a course that had them. There were 5 in our party and we all chose to enjoy the 7 course option thinking that we all would get the same items so we could talk about how it tasted. The first course arrived and two of us received the same items while the other three enjoyed three totally different items. We ended up having to pass our plates around so that everyone could try them and because there are 7 courses, the portions sizes are very small, not so great for sharing. I was pretty disappointed about that, I wish I would have known so that I could have specifically marked which items I really wanted to try. The chocolate dessert wasn't mind blowing like my sister's buttermilk panna cotta, it almost felt like something I could go and get at a lower quality restaurant.

Overall had a great time and the food was great for the small taste I got after having to share plates with the rest of my party because we didn't all receive the same thing. A little tip......make sure you tell them which items you would really like so that you receive it because not all the ingredients on the list are used.",0.0
"I am going to come right out and admit that I'm not an expert on Indian food.  I infrequently visit Indian restaurants and the totality of my Indian cooking experience is baking a couple batches of naan bread and cobbling together a presentable chicken tikka marsla.  So if you are looking for the definitive review on the authenticity of the cuisine served at Minerva, this is not that review.

With that said, I felt my lunch buffet experience was A-OK.  I thought the quality of the food was above average by buffet standards.  The staff members were hard working and extremely cordial.

Things I liked:
* The $9.95 lunch buffet offers an abundance of options.  It took three trips to the buffet to sample everything (including the desserts).  The lamb curry, the chicken tikka marsala and Aloo Gobi were standouts for me.
* The staff was constantly replenishing the buffet trays, so the food in the buffet stayed fresh.  (It helped that the restaurant was at capacity for lunch service.)
* LOVED the caramel custard dessert - that dish alone has me jonesing for a return visit
* There always was a staff member near to the buffet to answer questions and to offer suggestions for dishes to try.  The servers were extremely diligent about keeping beverage glasses filled and clearing dirty dishes.

Things I didn't:
* The naan bread was a let down - it was too dry for my liking.  I also did not care for the watered down coconut soup.
* The Spartan interior of the restaurant is nothing to write home about.  As Corey D mentioned in his review, it definitely will not transport you across the ocean to India.  In addition, the buffet is wedged into an alcove and it was difficult to maneuver through the other diners.  
* Sitting near the front door during polar vortex season subjects you a cold breeze every time someone walks through the front door.
* For a cuisine known for its extensive use of spices, I thought the buffet food was timidly seasoned.  
* It can be hard to understand the servers

Other observations and ramblings:
* There was a line to get a table by 12:15, so come early to hit up the buffet.
* Why is an Indian restaurant named after the Roman goddess of wisdom?  Is it just me that wonders about things like that?",0.0

The restaurant is so stingy that they don't give you the appetizer dishes until your main course is completely finished cooking, all other Korean restaurants give out appetizers first thing right after you've ordered food. Also, if you are just to dine there and not going there for bbq, you will wait longer because they will serve the people who goes for bbq first, and then maybe come to you.

"*the boyfriend would like to say that he would give Salt Cafe 2 stars*

I really wanted to love Salt Cafe, like really. We passed by it a few times and it looked cute, its in a good location with the proper hip decor. Sadly, it was a bit of a let down. 

Pros: nice decor, good location, good-looking menu, nice drink options (Fentiman's ginger beer for the win!), and the best 'tempura Scottish squid' (read: calamari) I have had in a very long time. Seriously, that calamari is five stars alone. 

Cons: The service was just... weird. Confused. We walked in an it was totally full and a girl at front told us all the tables were taken and just sort of walked away. We had to flag her down again to ask if we could wait or there was some kind of list of something. We ended up just standing around the front until another girl asked if we were waiting on something and then told us there was a window seat available on the other side. We were then told we could order drinks, but we have to 'wait 5 minutes to order food'. It was super weird, but OK. 

So, after the amazing calamari we got our food - two burgers with fries. Maybe its just because Im American (?), but I am so tired of ordering burgers and getting this half beef\/half pork business. So, the patty itself was clearly a mix of meats with some other bits and bobs added in and then formed into roughly the shape of a baseball. It is then put on a sort of dry, crumbly flat bun which fell apart after the first bite. We asked for ketchup and mayo because it was all a bit dry without some sauce. The strangest thing was that it was served with a side of cole slaw (?) which was hot red cabbage with mayo. I feel like it goes without saying that red cabbage that is served hot and covered with mayo is not so appetizing. At all. Strange.

My sister and I were looking for a place to grab a drink and chat so we decided to drop by and try out La Drinkerie since it seemed to be a very happening place on a Friday night. 

It was very convenient that La Drinkerie was walking distance to her home and open late.  The ambience of the restaurant was nice very modern and urban chic.  It was very trendy in my opinion.  I decided to order a dirty martini and my sister ordered a Tipperary.  We asked the bartender if they had vermouth and green chartreuse for her drink and so she said yes.  She later came back to us saying no she did not have any vermouth or chartreuse so we changed our order to a  plain and simple Jameson soda.  Maybe it was a miscommunication or she didn't hear us since it was quite loud in the restaurant.  No big deal.  Later on the other hand, we were literally appalled when the martini came as it was given to me in a glass that was less than half full.  Apparently, the bartender insisted that is how they serve and make their martinis (gave me a look) and in return offered to make me a different drink.  It was an embarrassing experience and I probably will not go back the next time I come to Montreal to visit even though the patrons next to us ordered a charcuterie plate that looked quite delicious.",0.0

On 8\/16\/14, my family and I traveled from states away, for a visit in a new place, Cleveland.  We had planned on grabbing a bite to eat, then heading to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. On a trip to any new place, we always hope to find a neat, local, interesting place to eat. Winks was a short walk from the Hall, and had a neat outdoor patio. We found close parking, and headed into the restaurant. Our group of 5 stood at the host stand for a good 5 minutes before seeing the 'seat yourself' sign, hidden by the entrance. Both bartenders, and 2 servers walked by and made eye contact with us, and not a one of them said anything. Typically someone would have thrown us a  quick 'oh you guys can seat yourself' . Not here.

We found our way to the patio, and took a seat. I must also mention, that there were maybe 2 tables occupied inside the restaurant, 2 people seated at the bar, and 8 or so filled tables outside. Not very busy, considering the amount of servers on. After a few minutes, a smiling server said he would bring us menus. 5 minutes later a different, unsmiling server came to take our drink order. We asked for a drink menu, which he brought us a few minutes later. After deciding on drinks and food, and placing our orders, we waited a good 30 minutes for our food. Not too bad if the place was busy, but alas, it was not. When our food eventually came, it was brought by kitchen staff, and given to the wrong table, then to us, then to them, then back to us. The fries were greasy and cold. My black bean burger was soggy and bland. We didn't have napkins or utensils for the first 7 minutes of eating. I will say that they somewhat redeemed themselves with the bbq pork sandwich with coleslaw that my brother had ordered. My fiancé got the bison burger, and that wasn't half bad either.

Now, I am not complaining for the sake of complaining. I just feel that we, the diners, deserve better. A smile, a hustle, better customer service. I am way ok with slow service and quick interactions at the table, if the place is swamped and the server is running around sweaty trying to take care of everyone. This was far from the case here. We could have chosen to eat at a chain restaurant, and get the same service and the same quality of food that we get at home.

First of all the place seems to always be dirty, restrooms are disgusting. 2nd to last time I went there I ordered a pitcher and 2 cups, the cups smelled like fish. I'm not saying they smeared fish in the cups, perhaps it was the dish soap's smell when not rinsed properly. Lady barkeeper took them back with a really nasty attitude, as if it was an almost impossible request.

Last time I went there I was ignored at the bar over 2 people who arrived after me, and I can understand confusion from the bartender if the bar was full but there were only 3 people there. When I raised my voice to get some service, this is exactly what she said; ""I'm on break"" and just stood there, and looked at her phone. Which is highly unhygienic.

They make their own jam, sort of.  It was a gelled mess of a real strawberry.  I saw other people get waffles or pancakes that are huge but you only get one as a serving.  They get two stars instead of one because service was fairly good.  However, I would not return.  Too much money for nothing special.",0.0

"Coal fired pizza? Sounds pretty awesome to try and a new experience for those Italian or non-Italian food lovers who reside in the Pittsburgh area.

Pros: Awesome setting and wall decor like iconic framed photos of Marilyn Monroe to Frank Sinatra and Pittsburgh Pirates memorabilia, the food isn't just warm BUT hot enough that the cheese will automatically melt once you start to consume the pizza, friendly service and accommodating, great outdoor dining\/patio with warm torch-like poles surrounding the area, and lots of television screens for those sport fanatics to admire while devouring!

Cons: As a first time diner- the service was similar to a turtle as in I didn't get any service until 30 min later even though it wasn't a busy day or so it seems, the menu listing was much smaller and not much of a variety compared to the alcohol list which isn't very pleasing, the pizza and other meals are supposedly all cooked with a coal fired oven thus my pizza was burnt throughout the crust and the dough was a bit too thin for my liking (how is it considered a pie? my bet is as good as yours), the seating arrangement is too cluster phobic for me especially being seated next to a family with children (GR!), there are no such things as condiments such as ranch sauce since I ordered the Rosemary dry rub chicken wings and it's simply too dry for water to even help digest it down.

I don't mean to be such a tough critic, maybe as my first dine-in experience wasn't too lovely but I definitely wouldn't mind trying it again! I have tried takeout from this restaurant and it wasn't too shabby since the food was still pretty hot by the time I received it BUT as I have mentioned before, my dine-in experience could've been better. It's a great place for those seeking a different variation of an Italian classic pizza and quite a venue for watching sports or dining outside at 10 at night.",0.0
"I have always heard rumors of how amazing their biscuits were and so last night we decided to double date it out, to have a drink and indulge in biscuit madness. FACT: the biscuits were fantastic and so was the service. BUT as for my meal, I would have had a much better review if I weren't sick to my stomach right now with food poisoning. I am officially a zombie in this state. I ordered the tray of oysters as an appetizer and I regret that decision immensely at the moment. My cousin and her bf ordered the endless shrimp and crab and didn't seem to have any issues with their meals, but it must have been a bad day to pick oysters. On a positive note, the bartender was great at mixing drinks but I am now fighting to retain any bodily fluids possible so just BEWARE OF THE OYSTERS! I had to give them two measly stars for the service, biscuits and drinks but I don't think I will be going back to this location ever again.

"My wife and I purchased a deal via Living Social of $10 worth of food for $5.  She purchased two of them and according to the details printed on the voucher, it said 1 voucher per person.  We stopped for breakfast and our order came to about $26.00.  We attempted to use the vouchers and the waitress informed us that the management would only allow us to use one of the vouchers.  I pointed out the details on the voucher and was told by the management that I could ""take it up with Living Social"".  He then rudely turned away and refused to discuss it further.   My wife and I worked in the food industry for years and this persons attitude was unacceptable.  Had he had the common decency to just say, ""I am sorry but the details are incorrect and we can only accept one of these per visit"", I would have been disappointed but would have moved on.

The decor is top notch; it's easily the nicest szechuan restaurant I've ever been to.  It's a great place for a date if you don't mind getting sweaty together before all the action starts.

The food itself is definitely authentic szechuan food, with real peppercorns and szechuan peppercorn oil in the dishes.  The dishes are decent, and are good enough to satisfy any szechuan cravings.  A-Ok on most everything; some were a lil above average, some were slightly below. I tried a bunch of the authentic dishes; from tony's chicken with 3-chili to boiled beef tenderloin in spicy szechuan sauce to the dan dan noodles.

"What can possibly go wrong with a combination of beer and mussels, really nothing if you have extensive beer list and huge mussel flavor options. The problem is the mussels in this pub are a little bit hit and miss the way they are prepared, they are either not cooked enough or not the best quality, difficult to determine. I'd rather have small quantity of good mussels then one kilo of whatever you are served. The French fries are not something to rave about either. Nevertheless the menu offers many more food options and nice table d'hôte choices. 

The ambiance is charming, beautiful salon with old wooden windows and mirrors, rather classic than old fashioned. I can only complain about the grey paint on the walls, so much not in place. Besides that the service is really nice, you will find attention when you need it and will be left alone when you wish.

The beers on tap are limited, but this is compensated by the bottled ones. Finding beers from less known or hardly known, or famous breweries in Quebec is always such a pleasure, besides the enormous import list.

"SETTING:
Nice environment that was able to cater to groups of all sizes, from small parties to even an ugly sweater party (this really happened!). Kind of dresses itself up to be a nice sit-down place, but unfortunately, the food was not on the same level.

FOOD:
For appetizers, I shared the Calamari with my friend and for the main entree, I got the recommended Pasta Trio. 

First off, I love calamari. A lot. I've definitely had better at similar quality establishments. The calamari was very bland and did not taste fresh. The batter was not crisp and crunchy. The sauce tasted watered down. The recommended ""Pasta Trio"" (3 types of pastas and ""all you can eat"") was a bit below average. For a recommendation, I expected more. Overall, the food was underwhelming. 

My friend always cleans her plate. So clean, that it looks like she was served only the plate. This was the first time that she did not finish her dish (Chicken Cacciatore). She is not super picky, so this really meant she did not like it.

The type of food here is comparable to Olive Garden in terms of American-Italian fare, but I would rather eat at Olive Garden anyday. OG just tastes better and is way cheaper.

SERVICE:
Mediocre at best. The waters were not kept filled. Not a huge deal for me since I drink slowly, but some of my friends kept looking for the water and it clearly distracted them from their dining experience. The Pasta Trio is ""all you can eat"" and they come back to refill your plate. A few of us were waiting on the third round...and we never got it. Even though the food was not the tastiest, we were hungry and still needed to be fed. The wait staff didn't even ask if we wanted a third serving, and just took our plates quickly without giving us a chance. A few of us were still left a little bit hungry...it was a grumpy ride home :(

The biscuits and gravy were a little bland, so I had to add quite a bit of salt. The Philly burrito was good, but like I said, nothing worth driving to the other side of town for.

*CELIAC ALERT*

Most disconcerting is the fact that the staff believe that their entire menu is gluten free. Shockingly (because they work in the food industry), they think that 'gluten' only refers to Asian mock meat gluten, and have no clue that gluten is in wheat. They actually have wheat noodles on the menu, and many of their dishes contain soy sauce made from fermented soy and wheat. Also, as I'm familiar with the products they use (like the soy drumsticks), I'm fairly certain that all of their soy based mock meat has gluten in it, too. 

The staff at Jean's seem very sweet, but I'm sure they have inadvertently made a lot of very trusting people very sick.

I went for the cheese and tomato mini-bruschetta-pizza thing with the spaghetti carbonara. There was a huge amount of bacon with the carbonara, which was a really pleasant surprise. The sauce was decent and not too heavy. The bruschetta\/pizza was a tad on the soggy side, and very heavy on the cheese.  I'm glad I didn't order a full pizza, as I saw one going past and the crust seemed really thick, with, again, excessive amounts of cheese.

Not me. Want already moldy strawberries at a premium price? Head to Publix! The organic clam shells of greens like spinach are always so close to expiring that I can't buy them and use them before they go bad. Same with yogurt, it's often either already expired or about to. The Greenwise organic whole milk is a good price and I'd like to buy more of it, but so often they only have 1 or 2 gallons stocked.

She says that when I get back, ""We will fill the tank up at a rate of $3.11"", which is cheaper than the street. I agree. There's no price quote before they run my card. I get a long folded receipt, my mistake was in not trying to hold up the line, knowing what my daily rate was, I didn't look at it. I get home and look at the receipt...WAIT A MINUTE!!
I was charged for a vehicle upgrade, SiriusXM radio and $60 bucks for gas prepay. 
I call the Hertz center where I got the car from, explain to them what the discrepancy was. 
This  ""CHICK"" on the phone says ""well why did you leave if it was wrong?""
I try to explain to this ""BIRD"" that I reserved what I thought was a Nissan Altima, Or comparable car, a standard vehicle. I received a Chevy Malibu which as far as I am concerned was a standard vehicle. It doesn't list anywhere on the vehicle what class it's considered nor does it list upgraded features. On top of that, you don't get the detailed billing statement until you're two(2) tires off the lot!! 
She ask me to hold, I get transferred to their corporate office. The individual says she doesn't know why they transferred me there but she will have the supervisor from the location call me. I wait about an hour, then drive back to Hertz. I explain again!! I was very clear in what was wrong. The attendant says ""well, the system says this is what it is"". I tell him that I don't care what your system says. I have an emailed confirmation with all the terms I agreed to. He asks to see email. I show him and he says o.k. Makes changes to the system and gives me another long folded receipt. I go through it and I see he did take off for the SiriusXM radio but not the vehicle upgrade. I approach again and explain that my confirmation was at a very specific daily rate for a standard car. He asks to see email again and says well you have a full size car which is more $$. I say ""then give me the standard vehicle at the rate I originally agreed to"". Needless to say, I kept the same car at the lower rate. This was more of a pain in the butt than I care to write.

   Upon returning the car, just knowing that the tank was about $15 - $20 bucks shy of being filled that I would get the difference back @ a rate of $3.11 per gallon.
 Wrong again!! Now I was explained the add'l $60 deposit differently, Now it is for the convenience of them filling it up, no matter where the tank was. When I questioned it, the attendant starts talking about.. because you went over 100 miles a day, so forth, and so on, just jargon! I explain that I had unlimited mileage. I get more jargon.

  It cost me an add'l $60 bucks for the ""Gas Tank Riddle"" when I could have filled it up just outside the airport for no more than $20 bucks. This is after the hurdles I already had to jump through to get the price I was originally quoted.

  Overall, it was not a good experience!! After reserving at a specific daily rate, I was left feeling like I just played poker at the casino... and only my money was on the table.",0.0
"This DQ is right by our house, but we haven't eaten here in over 7 years. My boys wanted to go tonight, so we went with the expectation of getting something decent to eat, with dessert after. Huge problems: the food was terrible - markedly smaller portions than the other comparable chains and served lukewarm to almost cold. The bun on my burger was stale, and the cheese on top was hard and cold.  You have to have the temperature right when you serve stuff: cold just does not cut it. I can say that even though the service was just average, the kids who worked there were pleasant enough. The dining area also appeared to be clean, for the most part. My sons both had a Blizzard, and were happy with those. My advice is to only go here for dessert. If you want a decent meal, go to Culver's or Freddy's, as the food was almost inedible here.

"So, I came to have my cracked screen replaced and here's my review:

The quality of their screen is WAY better than Desert Wireless, because with Desert I had to replace the crack that I made on my phone, in which they replace, but then the screen started cracking on it's own. Too afraid to go back and have them subtly accuse me of cracking it myself I didn't bother. My point is, I've learned that the quality of screens they use to replace your cracked screen is very different, and trust me you can tell the difference. You can feel the better quality here. The glass is a lot thicker and it's way more in tact (mine from Desert started coming off from the sides). 

To assure you, they provide you with a 90 day warranty in which if something is wrong within the 90 days that is not cause by you and caused by the service itself, they will fix for free. Props, because other locations don't guarantee that.

They also have multiple locations so that says a lot. They have a fun little facility with people wear ""doctor"" uniforms, and they ""diagnose and relieve"" your poor sick device. So props to them for that.

Whether or not this person is out to severely bash your business on purpose or not, I don't think it's proper business, customer service, or marketing ethics to call him out on it publicly. This then makes me think, if I come back...upset and irate about a service given to me (regardless if it was my fault or not) will you condescend me like you did the review below? We as a Las Vegas community all know we appreciate good small, local business just like any other, but it also comes from the relationship you have with that business..so if that is how you speak to a person who reviews, how do you speak to a regular walk in guest? are you going to inferiorate me for not knowing any better?",0.0

I personally found the waitresses to be nice and friendly and the beer is cold.

"This company makes me HATE unions and I know that may not be fair but man...if this is how all unions are, then I have no idea why unions are necessary other than to destroy entrepreneurship and business.

Just finished the ISSE Beauy Show in Long Beach and had the worst experience with these people. My company was just completely violated by the lady that was walking regulating their mandatory setup labor policy. I have an exhibit booth that I purposely designed to not require a single tool so as to avoid union labor. However, she STILL made us use union labor while threatening to shut down our setup if we didn't. I paid $600 for a guy that took 2 30 minute breaks and chatted up a storm (distracting my employees) while ""working"" as slow as humanly possible.

When the show was over and my crew began dismantling the booth, the same lady walks around and reminds me that I need to hire union labor AGAIN to dismantle. In the time it took her to go put in a work order and have the guy come to our booth, we were already done dismantling. He saw that we were already done so he went back. The lady comes to our booth and has the nerve to say the following: ""you are supposed to wait for the union labor to arrive before dismantling. My guy is going to help you pack up."" WHAT?!!!!! The ridiculousness of what she said still makes me shake my head. I told her that there is no way her guy is going to touch our stuff and I walked away. She didn't bother any of the booths around us who were openly dismantling their large booths, ONLY US. This is blatant targeting and bullying.

We ordered 2 main courses, 1 appetizer, 4 small glasses of wine for 125$, they were stingy with their food portions, and wine.

When I explained to them my schedule and asked if they could help, all they said was ""no"" there was so solution, no help... It was a simple ""no"".

As we were getting if the sphere I was trying to figure out how to get her out safe she had pretty high heels and her balance was not all there. I was waiting for what it seemed to be the drop off point were there is carpet so she would not slip as she was getting out. A male attendant told us to get off when I hasitated and told him I was waiting for the carpet he raised his town and restated what he said with a firm voice Step Out now, then as I waited a little more less then a second he repeated come on out. It seemed he had no concern of what was going on. I get by the time we were done it was pretty much closing time, let me tell you if she would have fallen and trip or something happened he would have stayed there longer than 2 am...

Personally, I expected it to be more like a restaurant that you did not have to scream across the table in order for your friend to hear you. But it was an experience, so we stuck it out. On Thursday night Martinis are $6.99, so I got a watermelon one because I love Watermelon. I am really not a fan of cocktails, so I really don't know why I got one. There was nothing special about it, but then again, I don't care for cocktails. In terms of food, I ordered the pulled pork poutine with sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries ($2 extra). My friend ordered the onion rings and a sandwich (can't remember which one). The best part of my friend's meal was the aioli, which I tried and really liked as well, so I got one for myself. The poutine itself was ok. What I did not like about my poutine were the overcooked fries, and the thick and chunky gravy. The portion was good and I did like the actual pulled pork.

"I have been using Yelp for a while to research things, but I have specifically signed up so I could write this review and warn everyone to steer clear of this company.

"We found a great deal on plane tickets from Cleveland to Japan on an online travel search engine. It was for vacation and we am not super rich, so we flew coach. However, since the deal seemed so good, we sprung for the premium seats with a bit more leg room. The flight took us to Chicago and then from Chicago to Tokyo. About 13 hours.

Ok finally glass comes out with original guy saying oh didn't think it was a hurry on the glass
Okay you did say would be ready today right
Oh was getting ready to call you
NOT,  since was now 530....
Was going to ask if you could wait another day dt being so busy....
NOT or you wouldn't have been cruising across the street to mess with Xmas lites while 4 others in store are standing around....
I was literally only person in store, cashier with no customer, other lady with no customer, 2 guys that blew me off earlier with no customer and said original guy walking across street looking at Xmas lites
NICE JOB LOCAL BUSINESS
I remind original guy that didn't you say it would be ready today
Oh yeah...guess he forgot about that....
SO IF YOU WANT THIS KIND OF SERVICE THEN GO LOCAL
Otherwise Lowes and Home Depot are right down the street
If I attemot to grace their doors again I hope someone hits me in the face with a hammer...

"The food today was all good ..we had chicken Alfredo ,kids ravioli , the new wings , risotto balls and the soup and salad , they were all tasty I really enjoyed the wings. The service was however pretty terrible the appetizers arrived after our meal we think they forgot that part of the order . the bread sticks showed up finally as we were done . I will say the manager did give us the appetizers for free without us ever having to complain so that was a plus ..",0.0

"Take-home Message:  The VIP tickets are NOT worth it. 

I recently arrived at this theater to see the movie we'd researched online.  It turned out that the time we'd chosen was showing in the ""VIP"" Theater.  Well, the VIP theater turns out to be about the size of a 1960's porn cabaret complete with what looks like a velvet curtain.

The VIP theater is an extra $7 over the normal price of the movie (so $20).

The GOOD:  The theater is licensed, so you can order drinks and have them delivered to your seat.  The prices are on the high end of normal, so not that bad. 

The BAD:  I've seen home theaters (OK, pretty nice home theaters) that are larger than this venue.  It's the size of a closet (see the attached photos).  Older sound technology...not industry standard even.  The seats seem to have been replaced from the appalling photos, but they're still not especially comfortable or VIP.

Basically, I really resent being scammed into the VIP theater.  So folks at home:
1) Double-check with the theater website itself that your showing is not VIP (Google won't tell you).
2) Don't go to the VIP showing unless you really want to drink during your show.    
3) VIP is 19+ if for some reason you do go for it.
4) There's a Dollarama with a huge candy selection on Yonge.  Coincidence, I think not!

The next time a few years later the dish was off the menu but they made for me anyways and I was seriously happy. So yesterday when we were in the area again we had to go.  The dish I was told was popular but not on the menu and also told it was a special on the menu this summer. Had the lamb kabobs it was o.k but nothing special. Why not make the customer happy or offer another sauce ? My point is there is no reason to go back again. Why get ride of something that made them unique and special?

"Excellent prices, nice staff, and good food, but Donatelli's is a little chaotic and cramped. I love the small neighborhood vibe and the biscotti is delicious, but we've found cheese in the cheese section with expired dates (by well over a month), and it just doesn't feel like the cleanest operation to be handling, making, and selling food. Of course, as people who shop the Strip District, etc., we're not going to get too hung up on that. Just be certain to keep an eye on what they're stocking and make sure it's fresh!

The prepared foods are good, and the deli has a decent selection...not to mention their absurdly-affordable sandwiches. It's generally cheaper than the other Italian market nearby, Groceria Italiana (ex. the same half-gallon of milk was 30 cents cheaper at Donatelli's), and has more in terms of general grocery items, coffee (they sell Nicholas Coffee!), and snacks, so if you're looking to do a more extensive shopping trip, Donatelli's is probably recommended.

"Stopped here never reading reviews or anything about the place... It looked nice and classy so I figured it would be awesome. Our waitress, Sharon just wasn't pleasant at all... She slammed our drinks and plates down. Then we asked for more bread and she said ""well I'll have to charge you"" so that is fine but when she gave us the basket it only had two small pieces in it, which before each basket had about 4, so that was kinda crappy. Then one of us ordered another beer and she poured it and just let it over flow all onto the table and didn't even say a word.  The crab in the stuffed mushroom app and the stuffed shrimp dinner has mostly imitation crab in it, which for the price is just unacceptable. I had just plain fettuccine Alfredo and it was great I ate the whole thing....  The lighting is just so bright and it's around dinner so I don't want to be under a heat lamp during dinner...

"I came here because the Feseejan is only $6.99. That's the cheapest I've seen anywhere. Super Khorak (SK) has it for $8.99 and so does Taftan. So I got that. My friend got the Vaziri.

I've tried tons of kebob places and frankly, most of them are VERY similar. I think Altona's Vaziri is good, just like almost everywhere else. The Feseejan is noticeably worse than what I had at Taftan.  I guess I get what I paid for. It was still delicious but just more watery than I'd like. It also didn't have a lot of meat. The best Feseejan I had was at Pomegranate Restaurant on College street. That one is hard to beat.

Like in most places, your meal comes with a can of pop. Altona is not the cheapest place and definitely not the most expensive. It's comparable to SK but maybe $1 more or less here and there. Meals come with surmac, rice, tomato. Portion seems about right. 

If I consider their menu selection, I'd prefer SK. SK has a much more complete Iranian menu. Besides, I like going to SK to buy some barbary bread. But if you happened to be in this plaza, it's a fine choice for Iranian food. Besides, this place actually has space for sitting. At SK, it feels a little awkward to eat with all the grocery shoppers walking by you.",0.0
"Disclaimer: first time to the salon and it was packed.

Service was slow and greeters were disorganized. I was told the wait would be 10 minutes, and it was 15 in the front and then another 25 with my feet in water. I selected a nail color that another associate took and then promptly lost while I was waiting, and I had to settle for a similar color without the sparklies I was hoping for. 

The place can service lots of people at one time, but the space as a result is a little cramped. Not certain if the door opening let in the desert heat today, but it was easily 80+ degrees in the salon... Which isn't great when your feet are in a hot bath.

First rule in the industry, make sure everyone has a drink to keep them happy.  Not so much!

My husband wanted to try this place out.  We went through the drive-thru.  He order a avocado burger w\/ cheese & bacon.  It took awhile to get through the drive-thru (service kind of slow).  Then once we got to the window you can smell the funk coming from inside the place.  Omg it smelled horrible!  I have heard of it being a funky smell inside but man I never was prepared for that type of smell. (That was the main reason why I personally didn't want any food from there). So we received his food and there was no cheese on his burger. He gave them the burger back and then they told us to pull around to the front so they can remake the burger. Why they have to remake the burger and just put cheese on it not too sure.  And why we had to pull up to the front when there no vehicles in the drive-thru not too sure about that one either.

After last visit to this location a regional manager promised to make it right by sending me a coupon for future cut at another better salon they own, but I never did receive it.

I recommend that guys go to a good experienced barber or if using a hair cut chain, go to one w better training or more experienced staff.",0.0
The Panda Express of Filipino fast food. I been coming here since high school. they have more selections than the comparable Filipino restaurants around. I love coming here for breakfast because everything is fresh! I just wish they renovate the place or maintain it. Food is good but I'm just skeptic about what goes on in the back and overall cleanliness of the place. I'm from the Philippines tho so I don't mind much but for American standards it's something to think about.,0.0
"Casanova is a cute little Italian restaurant in the Venetian. Unfortunately, I didn't know how small it was. I had a table reservation for 13 people and was seated outside the actual restaurant which was really the middle of the walkway of the Grand Canal Shoppes. It was extremely loud, especially since there is a bar not 10 feet away. It's also right before the food court so there was a ton of food traffic throughout dinner. I would definitely reccommend this place if you were in a small group, up to 4 at the most. They would most likely seat you inside where it is very adorably decorated.

For an Italian restaurant at The Venetian, the food was extremely affordable. I got the Timballo which is basically penne in a creamy pesto sauce baked with parmesan on top. It was so flavorful and very filling; I wasn't able to finish my plate. The bread they serve you is so good too and delightfully roasted and warm. 

If you want good Italian at a reasonable cost, I definitely suggest Casanova.",0.0

I WILL NOT BE BACK.
No actual website should have been my first clue, and only having a menu available via Facebook is even worse.
Guess what? Not everyone on the planet has a  Facebook account!
I went in the ""store"" to place an order, and as soon as I walked in, I noticed NO other customers inside.
It doesn't even seem like a business to me, more like a failed experiment, and someplace to bring in the workers family, and friends, and kids.
I ordered anyway, hoping that the food would be good, and when I handed my card to the man that took my order, he raised his voice at the woman next to him ""Where's my phone?""
Weird? Yes. 
She brings him his phone, and swipes my card with his Square reader, and hands me my card, and tell me that my food would be ready shortly.
As for Square, I did not sign anything,or provide my PIN, nor was I given the option to.
OK. I sit. I wait.........................

The cheese steak was mediocre at best, greasy, and the bread was soggy.
Maybe because I am not ""Straight from Philly"" I was not impressed with the food.

"We would have given this four stars, but we had a terrible customer service experience. 

We were seated right away on Friday night. The beer list was great, and we ordered two beers that were very tasty. A little too much time passed before our server asked about our food order. We asked about the cheese plate, and our server seemed only slightly knowledgeable. We ordered it anyway ($22), and also ordered the mushroom risotto and octopus. 

The mushroom risotto was excellent, and the octopus was very good. The cheese plate was also good, except there wasn't enough bread. This is where the bad customer service came in. 

We asked for more bread, the server told us it would be $5. We balked, and said ""we've ordered cheese all over the world and have never been charged for more bread. We want to talk to a manager."" 

Our server went away for a while and came back and said, ""my mistake, it's $3"". We said, ""how about $1"", he said he would get a manager. 

Some woman came over, although she didn't identify her job title. We asked for more bread, gratis. She said, ""$3"". We suggested that she sell us the bread for the reasonable price of $1, or else she should suggest something else to make us satisfied. She had no suggestions. She said she would talk to the chef, and that she didn't have the right ""pull"". We said, ""we want to talk to someone with pull."" At this point, our check was around $100. They really wanted that $3 more than for us to have a positive experience, I guess. 

After several minutes, ""Chris"" came by, who seemed to have the necessary 'pull' to get us our darn bread we needed to finish eating our $22 cheese. However, rather than try to make us satisfied customers, he acted defensive.

Note to restauranteurs: if folks on $100 checks want bread to enjoy their cheese, don't try to squeeze $3 out of them. A satisfied customer is worth much more than that. We will not be back.",0.0

"What a disappointment! After reading all the wonderful reviews and having eaten at the Phoenix location, I have to say this Chandler location is lacking. Had the Jade and Jerk chicken with jerk fried rice. Jade chicken wasn't horribly bad. It has an OK flavor but expected it to be 'more' I guess. The jerk chicken you can taste the spices and overall was ok. Neither will make me come back. The jerk fried rice was kinda hard. Maybe I got the last of a batch. My husband had the machaca and carnitas plate with refried beans and fried rice. DO NOT get the beans! I think the canned ones I had had more flavor than those. The machaca and carnitas were ok. May be good for a burrito or tacos, sadly we won't know as we won't go back. The snickernoodle cookie was good. I give it 2 stars for effort and because 2 out of the 2 meats we tried were Ok.

About 10 minutes later I arrived and waited at the counter for about 15 minutes before anyone even comes out of the back. It's a female employee and she's glaring at me like she wants to kill me. Thankfully the drinks were ready (although messy and dripping everywhere) and the transaction was conducted without a single word being said by her. Where was the other employee? Who knows.

"Since moving in, we had great feedback and great experiences with the front management. Literally in the pass 3 months it has went sour. Their staff is uneducated, unhelpful and all around useless. Literally there is DAYS when rent is posted after it's paid on time. Also getting notices for other apartment tenets that have nothing to do with myself or my girlfriend. Which is a huge issue of privacy. 

Since having gates in, which is great, literally in one day, an entrance and exit has turned into an exit only. This is extremely frustrating to us who live on the end of the Tropicana side. What's the point of a remote?

Yes she answered. Not even offering a condolence or an answer. IT WAS NOT COMMUNICATED THIS WAS EXIT ONLY. THIS IS HUGELY DECEITFUL AND UNPROFESSIONAL!!! 

 When I said that this was a major inconvenience  and a HUGE congestion issue for one who works a normal 6-3 and a girlfriend who works a 8-5.  This is NOT safe.  The women brushed it off.

I arrived at 6pm for my reservation for 4 people this evening. In addition to us at this time, there were two other parties of 2 inside the restaurant (4 in total). Our server took our order, repeated everything back to us before leaving - one steamwhistle to drink, and to eat: falafel salad, cauliflower, kefta, snapper and shrimp entrees to share.

By the time our salad came out, the beer still had not arrived as I watched the bar staff - they had clearly not gotten the order so I reminded our waiter of the drink. Halfway through our appetizer, we wanted a second beer and as our waiter walked by, we tried to grab his attention - my father tried to give a friendly and obvious call (because he is loud) but I felt it was ignored to the point that the manager on duty had to come address our request.

When we finished our salad, I thought that the cauliflower would be next, or that it would come with the entrees because it was a hot mezze...... that never made it to our table. The mains came and the food did not disappoint. Everything was flavourful, tickling all my tastebuds and the spreads gave variety with each bite. But the service was extremely disappointing despite the fact that the restaurant was 3 \/ 4 empty when we sat down for our meals.

We sat at the the front round table by the open window and a party of two was seated right beside us.

"I've usually had a great experience with Hertz, and although my experience wasn't bad, I wasn't fully satisfied, and it was mainly due to the maintenance of the vehicles.

I had to switch my vehicle twice, and ended up driving 3 different vehicles within a span of two days. The first vehicle, a 2012 Ford Focus, wasn't cleaned and it showed in the dirty exterior and interior. It also smelled like cigarettes inside. I ended up getting a Nissan Versa afterwards, but there was a problem with the E-Brake as it would constantly think it was engaged so it would let off an annoying beeping noise as your drove. Finally, I got a Chevy Sonic which drove great.

My logic in trying an entrée that wasn't wildly challenging was that $12.95 is a lot to risk on a complete unknown -- but if I tried something somewhat familiar and liked it, then I'd feel confidence in branching out into more challenging dishes next time, and could thus gradually expand my horizons. (This is after determining that genuine Chinese dishes I'd had elsewhere weren't available, possibly because my faves are not Szechwan. I did try. I rather wanted certain oyster or hot-pot dishes of yore.)

Nope.

The taste has remained constant in the past year, however I noticed the cake I received yesterday was smaller than usual. In a way it actually benefited me as I had one less person eating the cake compared to last year, but considering we paid the same price as last year I was also disappointed the size shrunk.

I have never seen a restaurant that dirty before, I've done food inspections in another state. I would recommend they should close down this restaurant for several health violations.

As we sat down with the table still being dirty, I overheard a women at another table stating that she ordered her food 45 minutes ago and still hadn't received it yet.

The room we sat in kind of looked like a down on its luck red lobster.  Yes it's underground so I wouldn't expect a view but it was just dark....I think I was expecting it to be brick or stone.

Once the plate came out I was excited to dig into my sandwich. Although simple, I love grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches, and figured no one can mess this up. Right?.... Wrong. 

After I took a bite, I noticed they forgot the tomato. I told the waitress and instead of bringing my sandwich back to actually grill a tomato and cheese sandwich, she brought me a bowl of 4 tomatoes. :-\/... Now, my sandwich is grilled. So I had to pry apart the gooey cheese filled sandwich so I can stick a cold slice of tomato in. Smh.

Then! My fruit. How can sliced fruit be bad? Well I'll tell you... It was warm. Why is my fruit warm??? The watermelon looked old, like they gave me the leftovers and they barely gave me any pineapple, which looked old as well. At least the two slices of orange I had were just okay...

"This was probably the worst experience we've had at a restaurant in a long, long time. 

It started off pretty well. We had just finished up picking pumpkins and were pretty hungry for an early dinner and decided on Outback because we know they're a family friendly place. As soon as we sat down, Husband ordered our son a cheeseburger and explained we'd like that FIRST THING to cut down on fussy baby times. And you know we had to have that onion blossom and some beers. We were in a good mood.

A little bit later and we've decided what we'd like to eat, but our server disappeared. When he came back, he had our onion blossom (extra crispy, as requested!) and said he'd be back with some bread and butter. Excuse me, where's the cheeseburger? And could we get some silverware and napkins? Oh yes, I'll be right back. Time passes and we were all lucky that the kiddo was entertaining himself by flinging around the kid's menu. When his burger comes out, we were relieved. And by the time we realized we still haven't ordered our OWN meals yet, the server was gone again. Finally, we were able to grab him and insist that we'd like to order. This was the moment that we probably should have just been happy that the baby was eating, asked for our bill, paid, and left. 

Instead, I ordered a bowl of tortilla soup and he ordered a chicken sandwich. And then we waited. And waited. Our beers were empty. The baby was done sitting. WE were done sitting. Our good mood had dissipated. 

The boys went out front to get out some energy. I asked about our food, which our sever apologized for the wait and said would be right out. But it wasn't. A runner finally brought out the chicken sandwich to me. Did you also have a soup?, I asked. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh, maybe? I told him to box up the chicken sandwich when he ran away to check on the soup, as we could no longer eat there. He came back with soup and apologized. The bowl of clam chowder had a gross skin across the top that broke when I dipped my spoon in. Annoyed, but hungry, I took a bite. Why did I even order this? And then it dawned on me. I didn't. I ordered the tortilla soup. So I asked for the manager. 

Guess what I did? Waited some more. The server even came by to apologize about how long the manager was taking to come by. My table neighbors even noticed the whole thing and took pity on me and told me how wrong the ordeal has been. When the manager finally swooped in, she introduced herself by saying to my empty beer bottle, ""Well, first I need to change that to a bottle and not a draft. What do you need."" No smile. No solemnity. No understanding or care. She looked exasperated. Taken aback, I tried to explain my meal. She said she'd see what she could do and disappeared. When she came back, my tortilla soup was in a to go container and half of the meal was comped. Table neighbors shook their heads.

"If I could give them no stars I would! I bought their groupon, and called them several times to schedule an appointment. They never returned my calls. Then when I finally got an appointment scheduled they cancelled it the day of only two hours before the appointment time. The only day that they could do it was the day before we were moving out of state. They came, did the car, I tipped him $20 and then I never looked inside until after my car got shipped to WA. When I saw the job he did I was furious! It was disgusting! The interior that he had wiped down had soap scum, he hadn't moved any of the seats to clean around them or under them, and the cup holders were filthy!

When I called the owner to ask for a partial refund he was curt and said that we should have inspected it, and he wasn't responsible. I told him that I thought that it was ridiculous that he as a professional detailer and business owner should have to be told how to do their job. He said that I was just bitching over dirty cup holders and insinuated that I was just being cheap. Long story short, the job was terrible, and the customer service was even worse. Luckily, Groupon refunded my account for it. I have a feeling, though, that karma is going to hurt this company! Save your time and money and DO NOT use this company!

She offered me a complimentary dessert, I declined. & then complimentary drink, I graciously declined as I needed to get to my gate to catch my flight.  I appreciated her effort, i hadn't complained, until it dawned on me that it wasn't a good sandwich. The service was thankfully very good, 'my' sandwich, the absolute worst $17 sandwich to date.

"Ive been here a few times and I keep giving them chances because the location is super convenient and the nurse I saw, Donna, was fantastic, and Dr Sink was OK.  However, the front office is ridiculously rude and unapologetically incompetent.  My first visit, they kept me waiting in the exam room for 75 minutes after my appointment time before someone came in and took my vitals, and another 15 minutes before the doctor came in.  After I switched insurance, I made a specific trip there to give them my new card so things would go smoothly, then got a bill from them and had to go back and explain that they billed the old insurance.  I work in medicine & know shit happens, so I went in there not really bothered, but when I walked to the front desk and said hi, the receptionist made an annoyed face and kept typing for another 10 seconds before asking what I needed.  I was furious at that point and asked to speak to the office manager, and she just slapped a piece of paper on the counter and said I needed to write my complaint down (I'm guessing from that, they're used to complaints).  When I ignored the form and explained my bill, she said they had billed my insurance right, and then someone who was likely the manager materialized, apologized, and said they would rebill my new insurance.  Last visit, I told the receptionist I had an appointment to get to & could I just get in and get my prescription really quick?  She shrugged in a bored way and said she didn't know how long it would take.  When 25 minutes past my appointment went by and I was thinking of leaving, the nurse came up and said she thought I had no-showed and she happened to find my file.  Front office clearly can't communicate and no one is holding them to doing their job competently.  The nurse was great and got my prescription as fast as she could, but there is absolutely no reason for her to sweat and stress because someone else can't do their job right.  The only reason at all they get one more chance is because it's super close to me and the nurse had a fantastic attitude.  It's a hassle to find someplace else, but if you're looking for a doctor, I'd suggest passing these guys up.

"Staff with an Attitude

The only reason for giving this place two stars is that in the past we have generally had good service at this location. Don't know what happened but that was not the case this time.

My wife made arrangement to pick up a small SUV on Christmas Eve to drive to Pittsburgh to visit her daughter, husband and three granddaughter's.  Only requirement she had was she preferred all wheel drive first and if that was not availabbe, then front wheel drive. Weather forecast was good but with Pittsburgh weather, in changes by the minute an you never know.

She arrived a bit before the appointed time.  She asked if the vehicle was either all wheel or front wheel drive and the young lady checking her in and made it clear she did not know and was not going to go to any length to find our.  The gentleman present finally did go out and confirm it was front wheel.  Not knowing your inventory is rather poor.

When we rent a car, we customarily do a walk through with the rental agency to make sure all deficencies are noted up front so that there are no surprised when the vehicle is returned. She walked out a noted that the seats and upholstery were dirty and stained and there were numerous dings to the paint on the outside.  She went back in to report this and because it was raining, they did not go to the trouble of confirming her observations.

In the end, they also accussed my wife of having an attitude because she was asking for things that any practical vehicle renter should ask for up front.

"STAY AWAY""---SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE MCDONALDS that is there in the parking lot instead. First time going, will not be back.  My wife and I and our young son stopped in on a Sunday morning.  For being the only restaurant any where close except for McD's for b'fast we decided to give it a try.  At 8:00am no one was there, was not a good sign and we soon discovered why.  I ordered the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good.  The gravy had pieces of sausage in it and was also good.  The eggs were fluffy and light.  But the potatoes were sliced home fires style that appeared to have been re-warmed, possibly from the day before and just barely warm and was tough and chewy.  Not good at all.  The meal did not come with biscuits and gravy as a chicken fried streak should, not even toast was included.  Disappointed.  My wife had an omelet that only came with toast, nothing else.  Disappointed again.  My son ordered pancake on a stick with scrambled eggs.  The pancake on the stick was burnt and should not have been served to a customer.  I showed it to the waitress when she placed it on the table and she did not offer to replace it.  Disappointed for the third time.  After all the disappointments the bill was still nearly $30.00.  The place has so much potential of being a gold mine with the location but as the lack of people that was not there should have warned us to stay away.  WE WILL NOT BE BACK...",0.0

"The best thing about this place is the product.  I know that when buying a Honda, I will receive a good quality car: good on gas, trouble free and safe.  showcase however is as shifty as an auto dealer gets.  They pump up the prices, then knock them down to make it seem you're getting some kind of deal.  

 In order to get me a good interest rate, they required I purchase all the extra warranties and service contracts that I didn't want.  All along the way they kept begging  me to give them a positive survey because if I didn't, it would cost the salesperson a part of his commission.  I was told this four times at the dealer, and again in a follow up call.  

The cherry on top was when they asked me to come back and re sign new documents for my loan.  It seems I agreed to such an inflated price, it was more than the bank was willing to finance, so they had to knock a few thousand bucks off after the fact.  Again, I'd have preferred to just take the cheaper loan payment, but the only way they would do it was if I signed up for the platinum package, which netted out almost the same payment as before.  I'll pay cash for used cars on craigslist before I would buy there again.

I have edited this entry to say that this business has repeatedly called me to sell me another car, despite my specific request to be added to their do not call registry.

Chicken roti for $8.50 and $2 for each additional flat bread - really small portion but very tasty and still pretty good value for the $8.50. I still thought the sauce was missing a little something. Maybe a little spiciness would have given it some extra kick.

Pad Thai for $8 - nice decent size shrimps. The sauce had a sweet flavor to it and once again dish is on the smaller size but good value for $8.

"I visited Alan's Butcher Shop yesterday afternoon with the intention of purchasing some steaks for a yummy dinner. As a first-time customer (an avid foodie!), I was happily surprised on my first visit to see such a wide variety of meats and offerings. Upon selecting three striploins at the meat counter, I proceeded to take in the culinary delights the rest of the store had to offer. A glass cabinet of prepared sausage rolls and steak pies (among other things) caught my eye. With my smartphone in hand, I attempted to take a photo of the pies with hopes of sharing my tasty discovery with friends. 

""What are we doing?!"" yelled a voice. Not realizing that the question was intended for me, I carried on with my task of capturing the beautiful steak pies.

I explained that I was simply trying to take a photo of the pies. ""Not without my permission,"" he replied.

Shocked and humiliated I adhered to his request and headed to the cash register to pay for my steaks (and a rub!).

I appreciate that the shop is a privately owned business with its own set of rules and policies. However, speaking to your customers in that manner is unacceptable and unprofessional.

I have been going to this place for a while and I would have given it a little more stars but I just can't because the experience that I had yesterday was awful. The technician was nice but the way she did my eyebrows omg is all I can say. Her name is Anabell and I can say that she is the worst technician there. She basically cut off my whole eyebrows and I am ashamed to go out like this. I specifically told her that I do not want to have thin eyebrows but not only did she make them thin she also made them look awful. I didn't realize it was this bad until I removed my makeup last night and because she filled my eyebrows with the powder I couldn't tell that she messed them up.  She didn't show me my eyebrows until she already filled them in. This morning I went on amazon.com and ordered eyebrow growth enhancer because it is that awful.

When I'm craving for Chinese food I always go to Cheng's Express.  I don't know how many times they changed management but recently I had this horrible experience.  I have ordered catering for my guests for a total of $200+. This was done over the telephone.  Well, listen to this, they took all my information to charge it to my debit, my name, address, card number, expiration and including the security code.  April 29, this kid delivered all my orders and asked for my information, including that he sees my debit card and ID.  So he did this manually, by tracing my credit card with a pen so the number will reflect in the credit card form, I TRUSTED HIM, gave him a $20 tip.  The next day I checked my statement online and there was these UNAUTHORIZED transactions amounting to $520 in total.  First thing that came to my mind is Cheng's Express is involved, and I'm positive that this delivery guy took advantage of my debit card, or anyone working there.

The upload speed is 1 MB. 10Mb and above is now considered high speed. There's a reason why the majority of places no longer charge for Internet.

"The ambiance was great and it seemed like it would be a good dining experience, but it was not a good experience. We ordered the steak for two to share. The menu says a 45 minute wait, and we were okay with this. It took 1.5 hours for the steak to come, we ordered medium rare and it was medium. If you love steak like us, medium and medium rare are two very different ways. After coming for dinner at 915pm, we ate at 1130pm. We asked for the rest to be packed up. They actually left out the bone piece that had significant meat on it, but somehow packed up the fat that we cut off our steak. How incredibly rude are you to pick and choose what you pack up for your customers?!?! Especially since we waited over 2 hours to eat our meal. The wait staff was only nice when we flagged them down to remind them that we still haven't eaten; they showed little to no care of our presence, and we had to get their attention to top off our drinks.

I would say the dish as a whole was great.  sauce was good, lots of seafood and large scallops.  only problem was the mussels were horrific.  they were spoiled rotten or something.  they smelled like poop.

"Allgemein
Mein Kollege und ich sind am Feierabend in Carls Brauhaus essen gewesen.
Obwohl das Restaurant gut besucht war bekamen wir schnell einen Platz an der Sonne mit Blick auf den Schlossplatz von Stuttgart.
Der erste positive Eindruck war allerdings sehr schnell verflogen. Meine Bewertung fällt dementsprechend negativ aus.
Bedienung
Nach 10 Minuten warten und nachdem die Bedienung mehrmals, ohne eine Bestellung aufzunehmen, an uns vorbei ging, beschlossen wir, uns aktiv zu machen, um wenigstens eine Bestellung abgeben zu können. Endlich nach 15 Minuten warten war es dann so weit. Wir konnten unsere Bestellung aufgeben. Trotz schwächelndem WLAN bei der Aufnahme der Bestellung geling uns das ganz gut Die Getränke kamen relativ zeitnah, jedoch wurde mir das falsche Bier gebracht. Ich erklärte, dass ich etwas anderes bestellt hatte. Die Bedienung wendete sich ab, mit dem Kommentar, dass dies ein Kommunitkationsfehler meinerseits war. Nicht die Aussage, die man erwartet, oder? Ich hätte mir eine Entschuldigung und ein Angebot gewünscht, ob man mir das bestellte Getränk bringen dürfte. Aber keine Anzeichen einer solchen Reaktion. Am Nachbartisch haben gleich mehrere Bedienungen die Bestellung nicht aufgenommen mit der Aussage, dass gleichzeitig 500 Gäste bedient werden müssen. Meine Meinung heißt hier klar: Wenn ich ein Restaurant für 500 Gäste eröffne, dann habe ich auch für Stoßzeiten ausreichend Bedienungen vorhanden.
Das Essen
Wir hatten Flammkuchen gegessen, den mein Kollege schon besser gegessen hatte und das Bauernschnitzel. Das Schnitzel für ca. 11€ war durchwachsen und trocken. Die dazugereichten Pommes waren extrem fettig. Ein kleiner Beilagensalat hat mir bei dem trockenen Schnitzel gefehlt. Zitrone war ca. 2€-Durchmesser groß und reichte gerade mal für einen Hauch von Zitronenduft. Gefallen hat mir das in einem Kunststofftöpfchen beigelegte Ketchup-Schälchen. Immerhin war das Essen warm.
Das Ambiente
Ambiente ist toll. Innen sehr modern und dennoch kommt Gemütlichkeit auf. Auf den Außentischen sehr toll. Die Abendsonne scheint die Gäste an und der Blick auf den Schlossplatz bringt schon fast Biergartenlaune. Das Ambiente hat definitiv Potenzial zum erfolgreichen Restaurant. Nach dem heutigen Tag reicht es meiner Meinung nach nur für ein Feierabendbier ohne Essen.

We didn't even eat them so it was obvious!!! Not to mention, they charge you for sides, the price on the sandwiches are expensive, then add an additional charge for a side. They ask you what side you want without mentioning it will be extra, you would assume the sandwiches would come with a side since the prices are high.

"We love prime rib, so we thought , hey, why not partake when we were in Vegas.  We arrived on-time for our reservation, and were apologetically told that they were running 10 minutes late.  No problem with us.  

However after 25 minutes, we checked back and were immediately seated. And there we sat at our table, another 25 minutes, until a manager walked by and inquired as to why we were not eating our warm sourdough bread.  We explained, no waitress, no food, no nothing.  The manager kindly found us bread, opened our bottle of wine, and probably goosed our waitress to get in action.  Once we had the attention of the waitress, she was pleasant and helpful.

"While I find this to be such a cute, quaint coffee shop, the coffee in my opinion is so so. The service is great and they do have a variety of coffee here, I am just not a huge fan of the coffee. It doesn't have a bold, robust taste to it in my opinion. 

I also find it frustrating that parking can be difficult. You would think that since it is on a side street it would be easier to find parking but Southside is just so overcrowded that it is impossible.  

The setup and interior of the shop is really neat. It has a warm, comforting feel to it. It has that old Southside building charm with ornate architecture but made modern with a rustic chic interior design and color palette. They also have a very small outside patio area that is relaxing.

"Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand, so we tried the door next to the one we entered. This ended up leading to a private party. Can you say awkward?

We went back in the main door, clearly confused. The bartender looked at us but kept pouring drinks (rude!). Not even sure how we discovered it, but the host stand was in the BACK of the restaurant. How were we supposed to know this? We were seated, and had to wait awhile for service.

Finally, the server came and took our drink orders and suggested a very strong drink for me. He was obviously trying to get me drunk (and succeeded). Caution: The Vesper is a strong *ss gin martini that is just okay. You pay 11 bucks to drink a shot of gin slowly from a fancy glass. 

He then took our order...and did not think to write any of the 8 requests down. Yep, you guessed it. He screwed up our orders and bills, then proceeded to be rude about the situation. 

The buffalo chicken dip is awesome, but be prepared, there is no chicken. We had one chunk in the two orders. The deep fried pita chips taste like donuts and are muy excellente.

"There was a swarm of bees under the roof of my house between the eves cover and the roof.  I called the BeeKeeper at 4:00 pm.  They said they would be out within 1 hour and a 2 story house would be no problem.  They quoted a price of $155.00.  I instructed them to come right out.  BeeKeeper arrived approximately one hour later, so far so good.  The serviceman was clean, friendly and presentable.  He confirmed the extermination price of $155.00 saying there would be an additional charge for removal and repair.  I gave him the go ahead.  He sprayed the nest area that is obscured by the soffet covering.  When he was finished spraying, the BIG up-sale began.  He said there would be a charge for hive removal and house repair.  The quoted price was $490.00 for removal AND $490.00 for repair.  These outrageous prices could have been disclosed during the confirmation period.  I asked whether there was a warranty and what would happen if I left the hive as is.  He said there is NO warranty without removal and that the bees could return if no hive removal.  I obviously said NO to his quote saying I could pay for many bee exterminations at the up-sale price.  I recommended just sealing the access area to the bees but that was not of interest to him.  I plan to use simple screening to close off this access and save myself a Grand ($1000.00).  To sum it up, the foot in the door moves were graded and ""A"", however the up-sale tactics failed the overall experience.  I suspect this is a common tactic with many of these businesses so my best advice is to not act hastily and make an informed decision.",0.0

The strawberry pancakes were the only saving grace. There was a nice helping of fresh strawberries, but the pancakes were nothing special. I can make better pancakes at home.

We went to this pub for my birthday. We seated ourselves, and ordered. 
Here is what was wrong:
The service was abysmal. The waitress must have been new to everything. She didn't tell us exactly what the specials were, she had no idea how to take a drink order, she did not deliver our drinks before our appetizers arrived, she took forever to bring us the bill. 

The food. The appetizer, chicken wings, were actually good. Our mains, well, here is a big problem. I don't eat pork. The waitress did not say that the stuffed chicken that they had on special was wrapped in bacon, however she felt it very important to tell me twice that it had a white wine sauce. 

I though that it tasted a bit off, but I thought that was because I went from the chicken wing flavour to a white wine flavour. Nope. It was off because it was something i never eat. I stopped eating, but since I had shared some with my partner (to see if he thought it was strange), too much was eaten for me to send it back. (Not that the waitress was anywhere to be seen). By the way, the white wine sauce was actually a thick cream white wine sauce that coated the entire piece of meat wrapped in pig, that covered the pig and made the whole thing just look like a regular piece of chicken with a few sauce lumps on it. I also asked for extra vegetables with this dish and no potatoes. They loaded on some par-cooked carrots and turnips, not really what I was looking for.
  
My partner got the steak and fries (it was menu - low grade stead and standard fries). The ketchup that was delivered to our table was unopened and still had the interior safety lid on it. We removed this one, and the one on the ketchup of the table next to us. The waitress had no idea how to get the protective cover off the ketchup (or that there was a protective cover on ketchup).

We did not order dessert because by this time I was so fed up with the service and the terrible food I just wanted to leave.

"My mother had accounts with Summit for 30+ years, going back to the days when they were the State Capitol Employee Credit Union. Through the years she was a loyal customer and had her mortgages, car loans, credit cards, savings accounts and checking accounts there. She really believed in the credit union philosophy and wouldn't have dreamed about banking anywhere else.

When she died she had an insolvent estate (was in debt), including an underwater mortgage at Summit (owed more on the mortgage than the house was worth). We surviving children attempted to work with the credit union so we could buy the house and keep it in the family, but they were unwilling work with us. They ultimately foreclosed on the house. 

Throughout the entire time the credit union and its attorneys treated us with arrogance, disdain, and contempt. They treated us like deadbeats who purposely incurred debt and who were refusing to pay it off. (I'm sure that my mother would have preferred to live and continue paying her mortgage at Summit Credit Union.)

In the end they dragged us through the mud at our worst hour. We had to hire an attorney to deal Summit which cost us $1000s.  And as if that weren't enough, in the end Summit sold the house at the sheriff's sale for less than 2\/3 of the outstanding mortgage amount. At that price we could have bought the house and kept it in the family. And all the money we spent on attorneys fees could have gone towards buying the house too.

I know they aren't running a charity, but they actually went out of their way so that we couldn't keep the house, and took a loss anyway with the purchase price they accepted at the sheriff's sale and all the attorneys fees they had to pay on their end. What they did just didn't make sense. 

I'm sure if my mother had known this is how they would have treated her estate and her children when she died, she would have chosen to bank somewhere else all those years.

Honestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren't too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it's ""Kobe"" Sure didn't taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants.

"I went to the brick to look at dishwashers. I was approached by an employee who made a deal with me and my wife for an LG dishwasher. This same dishwasher was almost $150 more at all the other stores so I was quite happy.
I was told at the time of purchase that there were 8 dishwashers in stock and the I could expect delivery on Wednesday (5 days after purchase). This was confirmed when I went to customer service who again confirmed that shipping would be Wednesday and that someone would call between 8 am and 11 am to ask if I was home.
Wednesday morning and afternoon passed. I had a technician which I called at 1pm. Since no dishwasher came he wasnt able to set it up. I ended up loosing $50 for his service fee.
When I went back to the brick to find out what happened they said that it was due to deliver a month later and that they had never told me it would deliver Wednesday. They said that the item had been out of stock for a while and a new shipment was due in a month.
After asking to see the manager the customer service rep. made a few calls and out of thin air found a unit that could be shipped Saturday.
The manager came around and showed me the bill of sale which had nothing filled out under delivery date. 
The manager then proceeded to blame us for not checking this and said that the protocol is to make a confirmation of delivery call 3 days before delivery. The customer service rep. then corrected him and said it was 5 days before delivery (which was when we bought the product).
We spent over an hour at the store during which we simply asked for $50 for the technician fees that we incurred. Again the manager blamed us and said he could do nothing but apologize.

"I'm a Vegas native and 5 guys is good but not fantastic. It's a very good thing that you can add any toppings for no additional charge but I feel like they need to season the hamburger meat. So far every time I have been here the meat has been very bland and tasteless. I NEVER get onions on anything, but yet I was very turned off because everything on my burger tasted like a raw onion and come to find out there was one on there so I had to throw the rest away because I can't get past that taste.  The fries were very over done and burned on the ends but at least it was fresh oil unlike other food places I have been to.

The menu was very interesting and it was hard to make a choice.
My opinion of what I ordered
- the Pastor Street Tacos (2 for $6):  The quality was great but they seemed smaller than street tacos which made me question the price.  Seemed very over priced to me, but yummy none the less
- the Green Tea Cocktail ($9): refreshing but wasn't really strong either
- the Pork Belly Ramen ($16):  This was fantastic.  Large portion, tons of pork belly, and just very well made.  I would absolutely order this again if I happen to come here again.

My friends ordered:
- Shishito Peppers: pepper roulette she called them.  Some where hot and some weren't.  I don't typically order these but that is the norm for this type of dish, so I learned something new.  I tried one and it was very tasty.
- Seasonal Mushrooms: Very yummy
- Tuna Tacos:  FYI the taco is deep fried and not soft like typical street tacos.  Also very small like mine.
- Bacon wrapped dates: there were about 6, maybe 8 dates in the dish.  My friend liked them.

"Came here today for brunch with my 6 year old and husband. Horrible food and horrible service. I don't think they were fully staffed because it took forever to get any service at all. The food was soaked in grease, the fries were limp and greasy and inedible. My husband's meatloaf sandwich had enough grease to lube a car and it tasted awful! Thankfully, my daughter's pancakes were good.

So much for a 4 star hotel and casino. I've stayed in better second rate hotels in Los Angeles. Where  do I start. Well if you like the drain in your showers to work when you clean your self think again. If you're  looking  for  safety... nope Dec.7  2014 police crime scene as soon as you get out of the elevator  in the morning. Wanna book your room in advance to save some money? Nope!! I paid close to $80 when I booked over 2 months in advance. Well if I would have waited I would have paid $45 at the desk. But that's not it there's an awesome $100 deposit and $25 per-night Resort fee!!! So what started as a $160 stay turned into $300 stay where it wasn't even safe to walk around in the Casino\/hotel. Sorry but this place is a pass honestly. You're better off finding somewhere else to stay.,0.0

"First time I went to eat at Angry Crab Shack was with my family. Of course I didn't know what to expect since I've never experience a messy eating type of food place.  Overall, the food was good and service was decent. 

Just a month ago I went to Cali  with some friends and for the first time ate at Boiling Crab. I didn't want to compare Angry Crab Shack to Boiling Crab but I never realized how different it was after coming back a second time to Angry Crab Shack. I went to dinner at Angry Crab Shack and went with friends this time but It wasn't as great as the first since now I know what to expect. The wait is always going to take forever but when we were finally getting ready to be seated we noticed that they were out of a few selection of food. So, that sucks. We ordered 1lb of Trifecta- king crab legs, blue  crab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, and cajun fries. 

When we got our food we couldn't help but notice how oily and flavorless the sauce was. And yes, since we live in the desert I guess its a given that seafood are not as fresh as we want it to be. 
We didn't get lime + pepper&salt till a little later on after we got some of the food we ordered. It took almost till we were done eating with everything else before the fries was brought to the table. We were told that one of their fryers were broken and that's why it took a little longer for the fries to come out and that there were others who are waiting for it too. Yet, the people next to our table that was sat a little later after us got their fries in time before their main food was brought out. Hmmm, wonder how that happened. 

The waitresses were nice and service was okay but it could have been better. I know at places like this its expected for it to be a really busy environment but it felt a little too chaotic and unorganized I think. If you're going to wait for an hour or more at least make the food worth the wait.

"A very strong three stars that I expect to upgrade at some point. This is a great concept that's pretty well executed. The dogs themselves are excellent, though I wish they had natural casings. The sauces are creative and tasty. The fresh cut fries were good, but needed a bit more crisping. The slaw was inoffensive but bland. Given the name, I wish they had more whiskeys available, and a few more local brews on tap would be nice to see. All those quibbles aside, I really like the place and I'll return for more tubular delights soon.",0.0

"Unfortunately this Pizza Hut was our favorite... And I stress ""was""!  My kids loved the pan and thin cheese... Always perfect under the past manager.  But the last few months since that managers transfer it's just been horrible!  First if all the employees just don't seem to care if the customer is happy and they don't want to hear requests like ""light sauce"" or ""please don't over cook"".  My kids have Sensory issues and cannot handle hard burnt crusts or 4x the sauce.

Since I'm a working mom to two sets of twins my husband is sometimes in charge of dinner time.  Normally this means it's a Pizza Hut dinner for the kids.  So He tried again last Saturday night 9\/27\/14 and ordered our two favorite cheese pizzas... They were both over cooked and the thin crust cheese pizza looked like it was made the week prior; cheese all dried up &\/or burnt.  So he kindly asked then to remake only the thin crust; even though both should have been redone.  Well the staff got our whole family back and our remade thin crust pizza wasn't hardly cooked; it looked almost all white. My husband felt bad to complain a 2nd time so he brought it home.  Needless to say I still had to make a late dinner for the kids since they were starving after NOT eating the pizza my husband brought home; I wish he would have done the same.

He had a few slices of the uncooked pizza and spent the night passed out in the bathroom... Yep; Food poisoning!!!

"I appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the atmosphere very much, but this style of pizza is not really my thing. It's the very thin NY style, greasy, the cheese and toppings wanna slide right off. And though tasty, we got double pepperoni, which in my mind means the pepperonis should be pretty much covering the pizza and YES I realize that they were under the cheese but just not enough. Waiting for the pizza to cool down helped the topping slide problem a bit, but yeah not a big fan of crust this thin. For NY style though, they got it down pat, so that's why the 3 stars. Plus I respect this joint a lot. :)",0.0
"This is a great place for shopping if you want trendy, cheap clothes (that will be out of style in a few seasons). But for selling, DO NOT GO HERE. I brought over the majority of my closet, which includes Anthropologie, Charlotte Russe, Hollister, etc. And all I was offered was $6 for three shirts and a pair of flats. One of the shirts was Anthro, so I kept that and the shoes, and ""sold"" the other two items for $3. Ironically, I had tie-dyed one of them (and they accepted that but not all of my other stuff). The reason behind most of my items being declined was because they were too ""old,"" even though the high-end items had been purchased within a year, and the rest were basics that would fit any season. In addition, the sales associates threw my clothes on the dirty floor as if they were trash, and then placed my used (read: dirty) shoes on top of them. I was paid $3 to drive half an hour and back, and watch my great quality stuff be treated like garbage. I understand doing business, but that was plain disrespectful and unnecessary. The ladies who helped me were very nice, but that paled in comparison to the rest of my trip.",0.0
"It's places like these that make me realize Yelp is full shit. I've been here twice, first I went vegetarian simply because I don't trust the meat at a lot of places, I got a rice bowl, with beans, some weird mushroom mixture, rice, salsa and lettuce. It was flavorless and stomach churning. Got chips and guacamole, again flavorless.  I decided, it's just another shitty mexican joint that I will drive past and ignore, like most. 

A couple months go by, I hear they are opening multiple locations, I decided I must have missed something, so I went back for lunch this last weekend.  My wife and I got 2 Street corn on the cobs with ""butter"", chili powder and lime. Butter has quotes around it cause what they use, that shit is not butter. I got a pastor burrito and my wife got a rice bowl. We also got chips and guacamole and I got a coke. 

First, the corn was forgettable, makes you appreciate the dude selling it on the street. My burrito was God awful, the pork tastes like it's seasoned with kool-aid packets, I took 2 bite and lost 100% of my appetite. One of the worst meals I had ever had. Chips were stale and guacamole taste like it was left over from last time I was there. No salsa bar. My wife's bowl was nothing more than OK. My coke was spectacular. 

As I said, my food was terrible, but also, their ordering system is terrible, welcome to America, learn our procedures. With a normal ordering system you might be able to cut down on the 3 extra employees standing around checking their Facebook.

The basic: The potatoes didn't really have any flavor and the chopped onions sprinkled through them were raw (ew to raw onions), eggs were a little under easy and runny, the biscuit was hard and broke into pieces and there were so many chunks of peach\/apricot that it was hard to spread the jelly...but the chicken sausage was pretty good.

Had they kept more on hand we each would have purchased a few more pairs. 

When I first called the shop a rather rude man answered but luckily a helpful young lady was there when we arrived and was quite nice. I did have to hunt here down though because the selling floor was void of any employees!! She counseled me into a different type of shoe which was a great suggestion for me. My partner purchased a very suitable pair too.

"I rarely write reviews online. However, the dish they served today was just beyond acceptable. The dish's name was spicy incense pot. 

First, instead of using chilli, the dish used chilli seeds to create spicy flavor. The dish was covered with hundreds or thousands of chilli seeds. This choice was just surprising. I lived in China for more than twenty years and had been to many Sichuan and Hunan restaurants. None of them use chilli seeds only in their dishes. This definitely cut their cost but it created a very bad feeling when chewing the dish.

Second, the majority of the dish is green pepper, potato, and oinion. Are you kidding? Potato is the only valid material for spicy incense pot. The rest two can never taste good in spicy incense pot. Again, they probably just want to cut the cost.

Third, I found two or three shrimps and a few squid rolls, which constituted all the meat in the dish. However, the shrimps were not fresh at all. I can't tell the quality of those squid rolls. 

All in all, I ordered a dish that has become very popular in Chinese restaurants in the last few years, expecting some spicy food of average quality. However, the dish I ate today was really disappointing. In fact, I could not even finish the dish because of tons of chilli seeds all over every piece of potato, green pepper, and onion.

Food:
- The Cuban Sandwich - don't bother.  No flavor, despite pepperjack cheese and flavored mayo (?)

- The Chili is the best - highly recommend.  Thick, juicy, great tang to it, just the right amount of heat

Our room on the 12th floor stank of mildew, the net curtains had holes them and the carpet had black spots all over. The balcony door was permanently sealed shut (presumably to stop people escaping) and the mattress was more like a hammock - a thin one. No bed bugs, as far as we could tell, but the sheets (while washed) were dingy and stained.

Did prison room with 2 ppl and bunker with 4 ppl. Both rooms very small as advertised so found 2 ppl is good otherwise you're bumping into each other and in the way of clues. Also both rooms(and only those 2 of all rooms) were dimly lit(1 was atmosphere and other had reason + atmosphere). 
It's a converted old house, so keep that in mind as well. 

Found all clues ok, some associations a bit random, one clue wasn't marked well as the team before us rubbed it off so that ate up way too much time figuring what it was supposed to spell\/# out. This is where I feel they lost stars.

"Came for lunch. Atmosphere is great and service was very good. My lunch consisted of some lettuce, dressing, a sliver of grapefruit and 2 scallops all for $17. When the server asked, I did mention the small portion and he was sympathetic but took no action. So I was disappointed overall.",0.0
"Perhaps no other eating establishment has such a wide swing in reviews as a buffet does.  And this is to be expected:  buffets rarely serve the best quality food; the spicing has to be near neutral to accommodate every taste and -- very important, but almost never considered -- we tend to appreciate and savor food less, when we have an unlimited amount of it and a huge variety.

That said, Jasmine Tokyo is no better or no worse than any other decent buffet, with the exception of providing more variety than most; having a very large amount of space, comfortably decorated; and not having that assembly-line feeling many buffets can't seem to avoid having.

Reading the reviews on Yelp, I can fully understand and agree with almost every opinion expressed from the 1-star reviews to the 5-star.  While it's absolutely true that this place probably has one of the best buffets in the Valley and has a much larger selection of Japanese food than Chinese, it is also true that most of the food won't blow you away.  The sushi is good, but not outstanding; the Chinese food is typical of almost every Chinese buffet; the desserts, the same decently acceptable food you can find in almost every cheap restaurant.  The big exception is the ice cream, which, while also not fantastic, is much better than you'd usually find in a buffet and -- MOST IMPORTANT -- is served to you by an employee behind the counter.  This might be inconvenient to people, who like to serve themselves or who might feel embarrassed about asking for seconds; but it's a very welcome change from the borderline, let's-be-closed-down-by-the-Board-of-Health policy of letting little kids with filthy hands and questionable hygiene scoop their own ice cream out of a communal bucket  (that, of course, doesn't apply to YOUR kids, dear reader ... everyone ELSE'S kids are slobs; yours, of course, aren't).

Service is fast, friendly and efficient.  

So, in conclusion, this really is one of the best buffets I've been to in Arizona; that does not mean, however, that you should expect a lot for what you're paying.  It may be, that some people will not consider a visit here cheap.  Perhaps.  But considering the variety in selection and the fact that I saw a number of people in there with stretch pants and wearing striped shirts they should have thought twice about wearing, it can't be denied, that this place is a good value for the money.",0.0

"More of a bombastic novelty tourist attraction, rather than a restaurant, I was expecting more.  This place is very gimmicky and could be a turn off for some. I seen a lot of this restaurant in the news and with all of the controversy surrounding this place I had to satisfy my morbid curiosity.  I had the Quadruple Bi-pass burger with bacon.  I consider myself a world class eater, but this behemoth gave me a challenge, I finished the meaty mound at probably the gain of 5 pounds and a cost of 10 years off of my life.  On the ride back to my hotel I felt my hand shaking, heart racing and my soul escaping from my body.  The burger was cooked well done and there was no option to have the burger cooked any other style.  The flavor was ok I guess, but you can dip dry wall in butter fat and it would taste good. My beef with this place (pun intended)  is how hokey the whole thing  feels, people get spanked, there is yelling and screaming, and it feels like a forced circus that is just trying a little too hard. This is definitely not feel good food. but if you want to see what all the fuss is about then go for it,  its not going to hurt your wallet only your waist line and arteries.",0.0

"Half baked cookie? Try raw and my fries,....microwaved. 


I use to love this place but my last few visits have been less than pleasant. That's probably being nice. 

They are quite pricy but it use to be worth it as the food was that good but this last year something has dropped. My first issue with this restaurant came on a game night, now I have been here many times before but never on a game night. A few of us decided to go out and I recommended Saddle Ranch. It was happy hour but due to game night they did not honor those prices,
I was unaware of that but we stayed. My drink was massively watered down. Normally their drinks are quite strong but that night barley tasted any alcohol in my drink. My friend got nachos and was asked if he wanted to upgrade it with steak and avocado, he said yes. Needless to say ended up being $30 worth of nachos with a handful of steak bits and maybe a tablespoon of avocado, very disappointing. I felt bad for recommending it and blamed it on being a game night.

Brings me to tonight all I wanted was a side of fries and a half a cookie which is my favorite. I called in the order and went to pick it up so I don't have to wait there. I got home started to eat the fries,....they were mushy and crispy on the ends like they had been sitting there all day and were put in the microwave. When I moved on to the cookie it wasn't half-baked it was raw. A pile of cookie dough in a box. When I called the restaurant to complain and asked for a manager I could not get a hold of anyone. Two phone calls later finally got someone on the line, I asked for a manager and was transferred to the Event Coordinator. Called for the fourth time finally got a hold of the manager and let him know what was going on, he offered to make me a new one if I came back which I did not want to do since I was already home. $18 for fries and a cookie and both were awful. He took my name and number and said he would have the corporate office call me back so we will see how that goes. In conclusion this restaurant has gone downhill and every time I go food gets worse. I should have gone to Walmart and got cookie dough and a bag of fries and it would have been better than what I got.",0.0

"I've been here twice, first time was last week with a coworker. I was happy to see a well displayed $6 lunch for 2 slices and a drink...Pizza was OK, edible, not great but different, I like things mixed up a little, so different is good for me.
When my coworker sat down, she was surprised by the bill, (it was her turn to buy) because we had both bought the $6 lunch deal and we shared some zuccini sticks, but the bill was nearly $25. The zucchini was NOT $12, so what was the problem? The girl behind the counter said we had gotten a couple of premium slices, so OK.
Well today I was in the area and it sounded good, so I dropped in. I asked the girl behind the counter which slices of the several types of pizza displayed were included in the $6 lunch deal for 2 slices and a drink. She said just pick a couple and we discount it. So I picked a couple, jalapeño and pepperoni and the other was ham and pineapple..... Good to go right? Nope.... Nearly $9 at the register....
I asked what was up and she said they discounted the items I selected.... Bottom line, they could not show me any pizza that qualifies for the $6 lunch, so essentially THERE IS NO $6 LUNCH DEAL AT THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Do not rent from Payless!   We rented from them due to price but when we checked in at Sky Harbor in Phoenix they kept adding charges - paid for a second driver which I have not done before with other companies - and charged basic, they said, for comprehensive insurance.  It may have been our fault to take the insurance as we usually depend on AAA.  Very convincing young man pushed the insurance and the fact that he could upgrade us without any cost since we paid for two drivers.  When we were through almost doubled the cost of the car that was originally quoted to us.  The car was filthy.  The gas tank lid was broken and their was a pit in the windshield.  None of which had been noted and we had to call it to their attention.  In Phoenix it is very dark when you are examining the car so we missed the windshield and had to return to the airport pickup to have them note it.  Also they noted that the gas tank was full but really only 3\/4 full.  Had to have that corrected as well.  Kept that car as it was a hassle to exchange and we needed to be on our way.  We eventually had the car washed in a car wash ourselves so we could drive it with clean windows.  We had intended to charge the car to our AMEX card but were told that the AMEX was not working at the time but they could swap to our MasterCard upon our return of the car.  It was not.  Upon returning the car, we asked for a receipt and at first was not to be given one but after insisting they relented and printed for us.   They also charged $250 to the charge card on top on the car rentals charges at the time of pickup to cover any cost  for us not returning the car at the stated time.  That was to cover time that was not already charged in case we were late.  When returning the car at the end of our stay in Phoenix,  Payless told us that the $250 credit was put through and told it would take time for the credit card company to get off the card.

"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. It's in the same shopping complex as Lotus of Siam so I could never hit it up as long as Lotus was open. Last Sunday night, it was on.

We were in the mood for some serious meat pie and my husband ordered the Meat and Cheese pasty which has pork, sausage, cheddar and swiss cheeses. I went with the Cheese Steak pasty. We ordered a side of mushy peas but they were out. Out of mushy peas?! Sacrilege! They must bake the items to order because the wait for our food felt pretty long. Definitely longer than 20 minutes. When the food finally arrived, I was surprised by how large the portions were. The steak in my pasty was flavorful and the pie was piping hot. The crust was dense enough to hold all the filling yet flaky on the outside.

We decided to end our meal with tea and dessert. We ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. The toffee pudding was the undisputed winner of the two and we should've gotten two of that instead.

"Visually appealing and nice idea, this was described in a local review and a Mexican food Benihana. Menus were bulky and difficult to read in such a close seating arrangement (go there, you'll see what I mean). Food was bland, though my wife described the green sauce on the enchiladas as very good. Rice was undercooked (it's not supposed to crunch like that), and the server looked at us like we were from another planet when we asked for a spoon for the charro beans. Service was clumsy at best as staff seemed unfamiliar with the tablets and card readers used for ordering and billing. While my server got it on the first try, I saw another server at an adjacent table scan a patron's card at least a half a dozen times. When presented with the check, I saw that my entrée was $2 less than the price on the menu, but I was charged $18 for a $10 quesadilla. I pointed those errors out to my server who corrected one and let me keep the $2 discount. I imagine these are issues that will resolve themselves as staff become more familiar with their equipment.

We hired Mr. Maid and they came to our home 3 times and we were very happy with the overall job that they did.

I was polite to them and even told them that I was very happy with their cleaning job.  I told many people about them and made many recommendations for them.  The owners seemed to be reluctant to lower the cost.  They did finally drop the cost a little bit, and I was fine with that.  Then, for some reason, they called and told me the cleaner that was at our house quit and they had nobody else to cover at the time.  They siad they were actively trying to hire a new person.  Weeks went by and I heard nothing from them.  I contacted them a few times and asked when they would show up to clean.  They gave me the same response.

Nevertheless, the server served him one of his plates with a huge slab of bread on top of the food. ""Oh, gluten-free bread?"" He asked the server. ""No,"" she replied, staring at him. ""Umm, I'm allergic to gluten,"" he reminded her. She took the plate away, and yet still another of the items he ordered was served containing gluten-contaminated food (from the deep-fryer). We suspected the deep-fryer was contaminated, and asked her about it, at which point she confirmed it wasn't gluten-free.

We gave the server our contact info, along with a request that the chef\/owner get in touch so we could help him make his gluten-free menu items truly gluten-free. We heard nothing for weeks. We then emailed the restaurant and heard back by email from the (very defensive and unwilling-to-modify-the-restaurant's-practices) owner. He eventually offered to send us a gift certificate so we could give the restaurant another try. The gift certificate never arrived, even after a gentle reminder. It's just as well.

Based on our experience, I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone who has a true gluten intolerance. I'm sad about this, because otherwise the menu is fun (especially the cocktails) and the ambiance is cool too. But most of all I want my husband not to be poisoned, so we will not be back.",0.0

Everything was dry, kinda burnt and saltless. Servers were ok, but looked very miserable.  Im not greek, but ive worked in greek restaurants before, believe me this is not what good greek food tastes like.  I hope im wrong, or may be it was my luck.

 I had an appointment to get my depo shot (which literally takes him 1 minute to do) at 2pm on a Monday afternoon. Upon my arrival i was told he was out on lunch and wouldnt be back until 2:30. First off I had an appointment. Why was I being forced to wait on him? He should have planned his day better and been back for his appointments. I waited until 3 and he still hadnt shown up and receptions call to him went to his voicemail. I left mad and reschedule for the next day. I did make sure to tell reception that if he was going to be more then 15 minutes late in the future to call me so i can reschedule\/replan when i should arrive. 

Next afternoon comes around and I make it early to my appointment at 3. No biggie. At least he was in. I have my baby with me this time. It took over an hour from my appointment time before he even saw me! My baby was screaming the last 15 minutes or so and no body cared. I brought up my displeasure when he finally saw me and his reply was ""Well things happen."" No apology.

I also went with half sweet potato chips and fries. The fries has no seasoning and needed to be cooked a couple more minutes to make them a little crispy. The sweet potato chips were ok, but again no salt and pepper. My fiancé ordered the onion rings, and of course there was not a single grain of salt on those onion rings. The food was disappointing to say the least.

"There's nothing so good on a cold winter night like some pho.  I've tried it at two other restaurants in Las Vegas and I find it very enjoyable.  There was only one other person eating in this small restaurant when I came in about 5:15 PM.  I was shown to a two top near the kitchen doors.  I was surprised how bright and modern the place was.  I expected it to be like some of the other places in the area, small mom and pop places that have a lot of wear and tear.

With the Yelp check in, you get two free egg rolls.  However, I wanted spring rolls so I let the free ones go to order the spring rolls.  I also ordered a combo pho which the menu describes as their pho bomb soup with beef meatballs, tripe, rare beef, well cooked beef and tendon.  The woman who served me soon brought a bottle of water and a cup.  I needed that later.

First up were the spring rolls.  They were good.  The peanut sauce didn't have a rich peanut flavor but it was OK.

Soon the soup came and it was very hot with steam rising from the large bowl.  Before putting any of the vegetables in it, I tasted the broth and it was nice and rich with beef flavor.  The rare beef was rare and there were a number of meatball pieces visible.  The broth also had some spice.  The pho also had some cilantro, white onion slices, and some scallion pieces.  

I tore the spicy Thai basil in pieces and added it to the pho along with all the jalapeño slices, and half of the bean sprouts.  I added some of their house hot sauce to give the broth more kick.  Now I was ready for my eyes to water as I ate this good soup.  I finished the bowl by picking it up and dumping the last into my mouth.  I didn't want to leave any behind.  The meatball slices were very good, the tripe was tasty but few in pieces, and the rare beef was rare.  The tendon was--well tendon.

I had an expired Groupon and this through my server.  She ended up calling her boss and they told her, I'm assuming, to take it at its face value not the double value which is what's supposed to be done.  When the check came, it totaled $4 and some cents.  I paid and left knowing that I have to eat more pho during these cold months.

First, when we walked in, the hostess looked straight at me, acknowledging me but not smiling, then turned away and kept doing whatever she was doing. About a minute later she finally came over to seat my mom and I. She brought us to our booth and literally threw the menus onto the table and just walked away. The waitress was a little friendlier, but not much. Not only was the service horrible, but the food was not good either. Hash browns tasted frozen.

This place is fairly cheap, but then again, for a place that charges as much as any other popular wing place (i.e. Wild Wings) could probably do a better job. 

FOOD
Despite the name, they do offer mild wings. Some of the menus have an added sticker that say ""New Flavor - Butter Chicken"" ... Piqued my interest and that's what I ordered; definitely not worth it. They came dry, unsaucy, with a wierd curry masala taste.

"Exceptional property, poor service.  I do love this property and I come regularly, but I'm always amazed at how bad the service is.  I often get a Casita or Fairmont Gold room and am always shocked that it takes me 1\/2 hour to 40 minutes to check in.  Check out is a joke.  This time I tried to check out on TV, which was broken...so I called the front desk to ask if they could have a receipt ready for me, but the operator said they front desk was ""too busy"" to take my call.  I explained I was just trying to check out and the TV option was broken and if I couldn't talk to the front desk, how do I get a receipt.  They offered to put me through to technical support to try and fix the TV.  I explained that I was not interested in working to solve their issues, i just needed to check out and catch a flight.  The lady actually yelled at me ""well, everyone else wants to check out too right now so you'll just have to go to the front desk and wait in line"".  There were 30 people in line to checkout at the front and 2 people working.  Crazy bad service.  
     So that was last week and I came back this week, only to wait in a line of 12 for one person checking people in.  There was another person standing there and so I asked him...""are you busy?  Can you check some people in?"", to which he replied he was just leaving for a break.  So, again, we all stood there scratching our heads at the bad service.
      Since I was only checking in ""quickly"", I asked Valet to just hold my car up as I'd drive over to the Casita.  With the long checkin time, when I came out, they had parked it.  Then the guy tried to tell me i need to pay $40 for Valet because I was there longer than 15 minutes.  We argued and I won and after 15 minutes, I did get my car back.

The next nurse wrenched my arm in the air  until i screamed in pain and told her to let go. i was there for shoulder surgery. She then said 'wow, it feels like its dislocated'. I said it probably is now.  She then blew out the vein in my hand but continued to dig around with the needle trying to 'get it'. After several minutes of unsuccessful attempts and me writhing in pain, she finally decided to move up top for the IV. The anesthesiologist had the personality of a rock. They finally took me in for surgery. I woke up in excruciating pain. The recovery nurse told me shoulder surgery was one of the toughest to have. I was literally moaning and crying from the pain. She asked what my pain level was and i told her at least an 8! She said she couldn't give me any more demerol, and did I want her to get my husband. I told her no, my little boy is with him and I'm in too much pain. I asked what time it was and she said 10:10. She gave me a Vicodin and left.  She came back and asked me if she could get my husband again. I asked what time it was and she said 10:25 and how about if she helped me get dressed. I gave in and said sure.

Service was good though as the manager there offered to take off the beef stroganoff because it wasn't good. We went to another restaurant after spending a short time there.",0.0
"I award two stars because the bread is, indeed, fantastic.  Other than that, I was underwhelmed by the pretentiousness.  The decor is painfully cute.  No, this is not what casual but sophisticated places look like in Europe, although communal tables are common overseas.  The menu is very limited and each dish seems designed to wow with an ingredient one wouldn't expect.  Why not just make something that tastes good?  Why does it have to be ""different"" just to be ""different""?  

I had the chicken salad.  The chicken was good but there wasn't much of it.  It was somewhat overwhelmed by mustard and the rest of the salad consisted of a pile of arugula and dates.  Forgive me if I sound like a rube for never experiencing dates with mustard before.  But I won't be doing it again.  If the pizzas available at Pizzeria Bianco are also made here, that wasn't clear from the menu the day I visited.  There was a pizza of the day, again with some unusual addition designed to turn heads.  I'm sure the ingredients such as the fresh herbs and house-made mozzarella are superb here as they are in Bianco's other establishments, but they SHOULD BE given the prices.  

Get the bread to go.  Otherwise the main reason to dine here is to be seen somewhere that Phoenicians who never leave the Southwest think is European.",0.0
The bartender was vey unpleasant. The bar was empty with only one other couple in the bar and she acted as if we were interrupting her. I asked the prices of there draft beer and I got an extremely rude response. Both of out orders came out missing part of the meal and I didn't notice until about halfway threw the meal and when I brought to our bartenders attention she rudely replied that I could have said something before I ate half of it.  The burrito was mostly beans with barley any meet.,0.0
"I signed on in August for a year contract and paid $69.00 a month for this service.  I got transferred to California in November.  When I tried to cancel they said my contract was for a year.  I understand I signed a contract, but why would I want to have a house sprayed when I don't life there. They are charging me $100 to cancel! I don't recommend them.  I never recieved a call after I tried to cancel, just a letter saying I would be charged $100.  Poor customer service.",0.0

"The location is convenient for us, so we decided to give it a try, as we are on the hunt of an excellent brunch place in Ballintyne.  Also noted all the good reviews Toast had received, so we were optimistic. The restaurant was busy when we got there, but we were still able to get seated right away.  It has a casual family friendly atmosphere and is very clean.

Our breakfast started off well. The coffee was good and so was the cornbread they brought out for the table.  But the rest of our meals was substandard. The waffle came out soggy, and the batter had too much of an egg batter flavor. It was as if they mixed up the crepe batter for waffle batter. The sausage patties were on the watered down bland side. My eggs Benedict were over cooked, and the hollandaise sauce was over the top with dill, and underachieved in zest. I don't think they do much scratch cooking in the kitchen. At least it didn't taste like it, and I didn't smell anything yummy coming from the kitchen.  And our table was close enough to the kitchen doors to have had smelled some food aromas - but there were none.  

The manager took the waffle back to the kitchen and took it off the bill, and that was appreciated. Our waiter was attentive and our coffee mugs stayed warm and filled.  So those are the positives.  We may give it another shot, just to see if we caught them on a bad morning.  But if the quality is that of packaged reheated food, we will cross it off our list.",0.0
"I love pho and all sorts of soups in general. I usually order the hot soy milk, #14 pho, spring rolls or regular fried egg rolls. It all taste yummy as just like the first original location on Spring mountain in China town. Unfortunately, I'm a shame to same I still constantly come here bcos it is the closest pho restaurant near me (I live in Henderson). They have the worst service. Every time I come here, they either give me water after my food, or they never refill my water. When my family and I order other drinks or smoothies, it takes so long to come out. Like, it comes out after we are done eating and we just take the drinks to go. Also, I always ask for extra lime and sauté. 19 out of 20 times, they forget. Not to mention, these mistakes happen whether it is slow or busy.

"I've always loved hash house, great food and bloody Mary's. However last night watching the beyond poor customer service was sad. A young lady walked in very intoxicated ordered then passed out w\/ her head on the table. No one tried to wake her get her water, make sure she was ok, or get her out. the waiter dropped off her food w\/o saying a word, countless wait staff walked by her as she slept for 45 minutes before a manager came out, he tried to wake her then just left.. Customers were asking if she was ok if she needed help. Finally after almost an hour the young lady embarrassed got up and left. I asked the hostess what there policy was for leaving people like that she just shrugged and walked off.  Yes we're in Vegas and yes she was drunk but who's to say she didn't have a medical condition?? Also it's sad that customers were more concerned about her safety then the people who worked there.",0.0
"I was not that impressed with Wicked Spoon.  First off, the buffet is located in an obscure corner of the building (a little bit of hike if you coming off the Strip).  The decor is nice (probably because it's one of the newer buffets).  While the presentation of the food (in the small little pans and pots) is impressive, the quality of the food is just OK.  There is a good variety but I found most of the dishes somewhat bland in flavor.  Also, prepping the food in the pots and pans has it's drawbacks.  Many of the dishes were kept warm with heat lamps and we found that that tended to dry out the top of many of the dishes.  Also, if you just wanted to have a tasting, you had to take the whole serving dish.  We felt like we wasted a lot of food.  Service, like most other LV buffets, is very good.   

We went for weekend brunch.  At $40\/pp, it's a little on the pricier side and I was expecting a little more.  IMO, The Buffet at the Wynn is still my favorite LV buffet, better selection and better quality food.",0.0
"Very poor customer service.  I went to the trouble of sending a photograph and detailed description of the restoration work that I wanted done.  Mr. Marble made the supreme effort of emailing me back to tell me that I needed to come to his business in person in order to receive a quote!  When I pointed out the obvious fact, from my prior email, that I lived out of state and requested some additional information, he failed to show the common courtesy of even replying.

Fortunately I was able to find several other restoration services with people who actually demonstrate professionalism.  Too bad this business can't take lessons from them.",0.0
"We were fortunate enough to get a table for three outside on a stunningly gorgeous summer evening, but I cannot (will not?) get used to the pervasive smoking. Cortijo loses a star (like all smoking German restaurants\/bars) for their smoking environment. One might think, ""how can you be bothered by smoking OUTSIDE?!"" Well, if everyone around you is chain-smoking and it wafts into every lung full of air you breathe, you might be irritated, too (unless you're one of the aforementioned chain smokers)! I really don't give a shit if you smoke, but please have the courtesy to do it somewhere else while people eat.",0.0
"Horrible customer service, cheap product.
I first stumbled upon them through Kijiji, and purchase a bed. I confirmed with them many times if the bed was solid wood, and they said yes every time. The bed turned out to be MDF. Second, they had scheduled delivery on a Wednesday and said they would confirm with me Monday or Tuesday, I called and left voicemail and nothing in return. Finally I called again on Wednesday and they said they had to reschedule
To Friday, no apologies nothing. I let it slide again, as I was in the midst of moving and didn't have time to argue. They came on Friday and delivered and installed the bed, everything seemed fine, however upon sleeping once on the bed, it seems shaky, and the front legs don't fully touch the ground. Again, I'm not one to complain and I didn't because I was thinking I paid only $250 for everything(delivery and installation included), which may be a lot for some people. I've been on the hunt for a white bench, and I came across their website again and saw that they carried it. Paul, the owner of Dibros promised to give me a discount on the chairs, when I decide to order, as they didn't have the one I initially wanted when I ordered the bed. Upon trying to reach their telephone for two days, their line wasn't working, so I emailed them asking about the specific piece of furniture. I received a response shortly with a different contact number, and when I asked about the product and if I would receive additional discount, not only did they refuse the discount, they also said the price of the bench now went up to $72. It was $56 two hours ago, seems like they read my email and changed the price on their website immediately to make some more cash. I told him I had a screenshot of a different price from two hours ago, and he said it wasn't up to them and the price automatically changes. It was all nonsense, I have my own business and my own website, regardless of the price change from manufacturers I have to manually change my own websites pricing, and theirs isn't connected to their manufacturers in any way. Regardless, if the price did magically change, they should have honoured it for the customer. Overall, it was horrible work ethics and poor customer service. Save your money and go order from a more reputable company that wouldn't try to suck the money out of you when you show interest in one of their products.",0.0

"The show was very entertaining. The performers are top notch.  

 I want to let folks know the possibility that you will be seated behind one of three very large columns in the theater.  Why a theater would be designed like this is ridiculous.  The posts\/columns I am talking about are around 18""x24"", and they have seating behind them.  You cant see squat from these seats.  The ushers hurry you there point to the row and run off, because they know the post is there.  When you begin entering the row you realize the post is there.  This happened to my party of six.  Two of us were behind the post.  We shouted back to the usher and told him it was unacceptable and moved ourselves to the next row down.  Three of us were in 'kitchen chairs'.  They didn't seem to care, I'm sure they have the same issue every show, it's not their fault its like this.  I'd say the management of the place is lousy.  After the show started they kept bringing more people in.  They started putting kitchen chairs in the aisles (seems like something you'd see in some third world country). I'm fairly certain there is a fire code against this.  I'll be finding out and perhaps the theater management will be too, I'm notifying the Las Vegas Fire Marshals office.  (I have photos of the chairs in the aisles we took as the show finished, people had to stumble around them to leave-can you imagine if you'd have to evacuate quickly, perhaps because of a fire?)",0.0
This place has the worst service compared to two other Indian restaurants beside it. Took the server 20 mins to give us menu after which it only got worst. Our drinks and food arrived 40 minutes after we ordered and after few bits I found a hair in my naan. We pointed out to the service and they didn't do anything about - not even replacement for the food we found the hair in! Showed that they are failing at every level from service to setting to Hygiene. I wonder how filthy their kitchen might be inside. I wouldn't be surprised if people get food poisoning here. Their standards are lowest and food is disgusting. I would never step in there again and I recommend the other restaurants over this one.,0.0

"We were in the mood for something sweet so we decided to try a cupcake at Mind Over Batter. The place was empty. The cashier was friendly. I decided to go with the Pink Cadillac as strawberry and vanilla sounded really good! They won't give out cups of water, you have to buy a small bottle. Which I did not as Arrowhead gives me a headache. The cupcake was super sweet but didn't even have a hint of strawberry flavor which left me disappointed. It was moist and heavy and there was plenty of frosting. All in all, I wouldn't visit them again as I wasn't all that impressed with my cupcake.",0.0

"We got 4 tickets through Groupon, and then called the box office to upgrade to the Splatter Zone for a Saturday night show. This was a big mistake in hindsight because they positioned the speakers in such a way that it hits the main audience but not the Splatter Zone. The whole show was a muffled mess. 

But even if I could hear clearly, I was pretty disappointed. I saw this show in New York, and I loved it, but it's been altered so much that it really lost most of the charm it once had. The show just goes through the basic set up of the plot, then it is just people turning into deadites one at a time with songs in-between. Two people in the group had never seen the movies, and they were completely lost. The New York one actually had a story to follow. 

The Splatter Zone was not worth the extra money. I was expecting the show to be creative about getting blood on the audience, but 90% of it was one guy walking back and forth spraying us, even in intermission. 

This show falls on the shoulders of the actor playing Ash, and all 4 of us agreed he didn't do a good job. He seemed really stiff and nervous through the first half and only started loosening up near the end. 

The reason I'm giving this a 2 out of 5 rating instead of a 1 is that the theater staff and cast were really friendly. The guy I spoke with on the phone at the box office was very accommodating, and the people who take your tickets\/show you to your section\/etc. were nice and enthusiastic. So essentially the people were great, but the show was boring and an audio mess.",0.0
"Overpriced, bad service and we went really late after 9 p.m. so no excuse for crap service when four waiters just stood around. Waitress was rude and impatient when I asked her which pizza's better between a couple of choices I was debating on, as she was abrupt and only recommended a spicy one when I kept telling her spicy doesn't matter.  She brought my friend's wine in little glass vase and reached over dishes to pour it quickly into her wine glass already on table then walked off...She didn't pickup the glass and didn't ask my friend to taste it, which is not the norm at other places I've been to.  Pizza had very tiny slivers of prosciutto, lots of cheese and sauce. Flavours weren't bad and I realized it was too salty because of the anchovies so not their fault, but I much prefer other Neapolitan pizza joints.  When we left, an old big woman whom appeared to be an owner at the front didn't say bye and only stared at us rudely.  I'm not impressed and for a $16 pizza before tax so $21 after tax and tip, I don't think it's worth it.",0.0

I admit that I have not tried anything except their croissant. It was good, but not my favorite. I think it comes down to a matter of personal taste. Their croissant is very buttery, so if you like that, this is the best croissant for you. It was so buttery that the half I heated up in my toaster oven started to ooze butter droplets.
