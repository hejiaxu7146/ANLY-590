"I am so glad my son said he was craving Greek!  We found this place because it was on YelpEats as closest to our house.  

The gyros were great!  Packed full of meat that was fresh and moist. The Feta fries were very flavorful and had the perfect amount of feta. 

I thought I had ordered Lebni but got extra Tzatziki which was fine.  I think next time I will try their hummus or babaganoush.

We also ordered Sarma - like  dolma rolls - cabbage, meat, rice in a lemon olive oil - oh YUM!  

We will eat here in the future!",1.0
This is their second location and it defiantly does not disappoint! Not only are the beers Fantastic (which i expected since we love their downtown location) but the atmosphere is awesome!! East Mesa needed something like this bad you can watch planes land and take off and see the beautiful mountains. The food here is done by their neighbors at Steak and Stone with many yummy bar foods to choose from! This location also has a FULL bar which their downtown location does not so for those who are not beer drinkers there is plenty options for you as well! Would recommend this place to everybody!!!!,1.0
"Some cuisines are hit and miss for me.  Take Indian food for example.  I've had Indian food that runs the gamut from amazing to awful.  Same goes for Vietnamese cuisine.  I've been to valley Vietnamese staples like Rice Paper & Da Vang, as well as spots outside the Phoenix area with decidedly mixed results.  Which partly explains why I probably avoided Pho Thanh as long as I have.  I just wasn't super confident I'd have a good experience here.  But with an empty fridge on Sunday and Pho Thanh still being bookmarked on my Yelp account forever, I got up the nerve to give Pho Thanh a try for lunch.

Set right on the light rail on the northwest corner of 17th Ave and Camelback, Pho Thanh occupies a surprisingly large space in a small Asian strip center.  The restaurant is pretty humble looking both inside and out, but I was almost immediately taken aback by how large the interior was, with seating for upwards of 200 at a time.  The tables are numbered for reasons I'll explain later and the place was super busy, but fortunately the waitress guided me to one of the few available small tables in the corner (Table 4, for the record).

The menu, as the Yelp reviews and photos have accurately depicted, is vast.  With tons of apps, sides, soups, sandwiches, and house specialities to choose from.  Yet with all the choices available, the very first appetizer menu item immediately caught my eye.  The Goi Cuon is a pair of rice paper spring rolls with all kinds of goodies.  Pork, shrimp, lettuce, cilantro, mint, sprouts, and vermicelli noodles.  Served with a nice light peanut sauce on the side.  Admittedly I'm more of a fried roll kind of guy moreso than rice paper, but the interior of the roll was fabulous.  The mint and cilantro elements really tingle your tongue and give it more depth than just the meat and peanut sauce alone.  As for my entree, I went with one of the house specialities.  The Bo Luc Lac is a relatively simple dish in the grand scheme of things.  Meat, white rice, and salad.  But the meat in this case is cubes of filet mignon that are cooked until they're sizzling hot and the meat comes out to your table still sizzling and bubbling much as you would see a steak fajita tray fresh off the burner.  The sauce on the meat is a mixture of soy and a couple of other elements I couldn't quite put my finger on.  But the jasmine rice soaked up that sauce superbly and the salad served as a lovely palate cleanser.  Really solid lunch.

Two other aspects that stand out about Pho Thanh are the remarkable efficiency of their staff and of course the prices.  From the moment I stepped in the door, the staff were incredibly quick to get me seated, get me a water, take my order, and brought out both my app and entree in rapid fire succession.  This despite well over 100 other patrons in the restaurant for lunch.  Back to that table numbering thing.  At the end of your meal, they don't bring your check out to you.  Instead you walk up to the register, tell them your table number and pay there on the spot.  As for the prices, yeah they're cheap.  Accessible to virtually anyone of any income level.  I got one of the more expensive entrees at $11, but the overwhelming plurality of the menu is less than $10, with many being less than $5. 

Total cost for my app and entree plus tax and tip came to $18.  A great meal with great flavors, great staff, in a humble (but spacious) neighborhood friendly spot.  I'll be back for some Pho and perhaps a Banh Mi sandwich before long.  Vietnamese food remains hit or miss for me, but this CenPho Vietnamese restaurant definitely nails it.",1.0
"Went here two days in a row and seriously considered ordering one of everything because I brought 5 people with me the second day. Everyone was happy with the bakery items such as the Zaatar Manousheh, as well as the individual plates we ordered of various pita wraps and Shawarma plates. We got the fresh made lemonade and strawberry lemonade that my 6 year old absolutely loved! Before we left we ordered cappuccinos and a LARGE to-go order for friends that couldn't come with us. Going on Friday for breakfast! Lunch menu can accommodate for Vegetarians, Vegans and children. So very sad we are going back home to New Orleans, can't wait to return!

"We hit gold finding Dr. Feldman's practice! My son felt immediately at ease with his staff. They're encouraging  and offer the kids fun incentives to keep them on task with their end of treatment.  There was no hard sell of treatment plans, we were presented with plans for both now and delayed future treatment. Dr. Feldman took the time to explain and answer all of our questions so we could make an informed choice for our son. Our confidence was only further cemented in this practice because of it.  Finally, this entire office is the most mindful office I've ever come across when it comes to your time. All of our regular scheduled and emergency appointments have had my son called back to chairs in minutes. This office is a finely tuned machine with heart. I enjoy seeing all their social media posts of their patients sharing their beautiful new smiles but truly behind that there's whole families wearing those smiles having selected Dr. Feldman and his staff.",1.0
"Graffiti is an unassuming building that's really easy to miss unless you're looking for it. We went tonight with our dog in tow.  Any place that allows me to bring my puppy daughter is automatically good by me!The back patio is so relaxing and pretty, definitely a good hangout spot. It wasn't too hot, and the patio was just right for a June night. 

The food was probably one of the best I have had yet in cleveland. We ordered the Ruben ribs to start. They were the only forgettable part of the meal. The meat fell off the bone but there wasn't much flavoring to them. Hubs ordered the Battery Park hot dog which he described as incredible. I didn't try it, but he said he really enjoyed it. I ordered the Graffiti burger. Holyyyyyyy wow. The best burger I've had in my life. Whoever decided to put goat cheese and a fried green tomato on a burger deserves all the high fives. Burgers are never my go to meal choice and I never finish a whole one. But this was incredible. I will be back and I will order that dang burger again. The fries were pretty good too. Perfectly seasoned and fresh as hell, yes please.

The reason I simply cannot give Graffiti 5 stars was because of the service. Our waitress was very nice and did a great job but this place was S L O W. Maybe it was an off night? Maybe it's just how they operate. But even our drinks took at least 15 minutes. And we sat there without water forever. Definitely not a place to go and have a quick meal that's for sure. There were also plenty of open spots on the patio so they weren't even super busy. Also, they were out of the beer my husband wanted to order and like 3 others. I ordered their sangria of the day which was the perfect summer drink, but they ran out after my serving. When I asked for Chardonnay, they were also out of Chardonnay. On Saturday night. Anyways, the food was worth it and the patio is so cute. I do recommend!!",1.0
"My fiancé and I are preparing for our wedding and we've been looking for ways to capture our best selves in our wedding pics. After a quick Google search, i came across whiten up today.

"I came to Friday Night Live at the ROM last week and had a really good time. The experience is great when you go with friends whose company you can enjoy while waiting in line. Immediately upon arriving there were two lines. One was for people who did not have tickets and the other was for people who purchased their tickets online. If you didn't have a ticket, you had to wait in line to buy it and then move to the next line with people who bought them online. The line for people who purchased their ticket online took about 10-15 minutes to get through.  Upon entering the ROM there was another line for coat check but I didn't bother waiting, since my friends were already inside. I caught up with them and they were in the line to purchase food and drink tickets. The line was also long but I don't know how long they waited to get to the front.

We first made our way to the upstairs lounge\/bar where we all ordered drinks. They had nothing fancy but were able to mix fruit juice, alcohol and soda. We then walked around to check out some of the exhibits, food vendors and DJ's. It was fun to have live music wherever we went. We then decided to wait in line to see the new whale exhibit. The line took about 30 minutes.  The exhibit was really good and we got to see it the night before it opened to the public. They even had an exhibit where you could dress up as a krill. We convinced one of our friends to dress up in the costume and that was fun.

After checking out the whale exhibit we tried some of the food provided by the different vendors. Once again, the lines were kind of long but there were some options that were both gluten and lactose  free.  We then walked around and viewed the dinosaurs and the natural stones exhibit. 

Allover it was a really fun event and it only cost $15.00, which is definitely a bargain. If you go during the day, you need to be quiet and it would cost $30.00 to attend. I would definitely attend Friday Night Live at the ROM again.",1.0
"I was very happy with Tesla Service in Las Vegas. Curtis Ado helped my wife and I though our decisions of leasing a Model S. There were no pressure from anyone there, and the car pretty much speaks for itself. Christian, Curtis, and Leah helped us all the way up to driving the New Model S off the Tesla Lot.
I was so impressed by these people that I sent them a Large Gift Basket. I have bought Lexus, and three Mercedes and never felt like sending them even a Thank You. The last two New Cars I leased in 2013 and the Tesla in 2016. There is no going back to the other dealerships, I have never been treated so well, and not looked at as an admirer wasting time and wishing, but felt like family and a future customer. So when my Lease is up, I will buy my next Tesla.",1.0

"Best Hawaiian restaurant in town. Their food is tasty and the portion is huge! I can get three meals out of one entree haha. Love the kalbi here; very flavorful. They give you nice cut kalbi too. Their kalua pork is good as well. Very tender and juicy. Even their macaroni salad tastes better than other places. Their prices are very reasonable. Most entrees are around $9. They get real busy during lunch or dinner hours, so try to get there earlier to secure a table or be prepare to wait. Friendly service all around. They also have another location on eastern and pebble. A must try if you love the island flavor! ;)",1.0

"When I first went to Banh Mi Bistro, I could not believe that a Banh Mi cost $6-8. Growing up, the sandwich was $2-4, so the steep price difference baffled me. But with the great reviews, I was willing to try it and I am so glad I did. Since that first time I have been back too many times to count.

I usually order #7 Shaken Beef Banh Mi. The beef has always been tender and flavorful and the bread toasty and light. The sandwich is the size of two regular banh mi put together, so it is worth the cost. 

The Lotus Root Salad and Green Papya Salad are both refreshing and light. And the Noodle Salad Bowls with grilled pork or grilled chicken is also tasty and filling. Banh Mi Bistro also has a stamp card so after 10 sandwich you can get one free.

The pita was sooooo delicious and those roasted potatoes amazing as well. I poured the Marsala sauce on my rice and it gave a special touch to my meal even though I was supposed to pour it on to my steak. 
The lemon pepper chicken is like a explosion of flavors in to your month. However I would give you a tip, if you order it ask them to put the sauce aside so you can pour it as you wish, the sauce can be overwhelming for some people but nothing that would mess up your meal.

"The restaurant was founded in 1968 by namesake Carolina Valenzuela, who still presides over the kitchen.   It was first at 105 W. Hilton Ave. and later at 1519 E. Mohave St.   Since 1986, it has been at 1202 E. Mohave in a building that also has housed a coin-operated laundry and a grocery store.
   
   No one is bothered by Carolina's vague pricing.   People just order what they want with the understanding that their tab, including a large, refillable drink, likely won't exceed $5.
   
   The tortillas, which are available by the dozen for takeout, are churned out by a crew of workers who stand before a bank of hot griddles, deftly flipping the paper thin rounds of dough and piling them up for packaging. 

   I am particularly partial to the soft-shell machaca taco.   It's a simple affair with a warm corn tortilla wrapped around a generous portion of the subtly spiced shredded beef filling.   It's a perfect starter before tackling the main course --- one of Carolina's incredible burros wrapped in a homemade flour tortilla.
   The plain bean burro is majestic; the green chile burro, marvelous; the red chile burro, legendary; but the Oaxaca special with beans, chorizo, potatoes and cheese is pure heaven.
   The rich, piquant flavor of the chorizo is enhanced by the cheese and potatoes and tempered by the beans and the chewy tortilla wrap.
   Carolina's burros can be ordered enchilada-style with red or green sauce, lettuce and cheese, or deep-fried like a chimichanga.

"How to find it: street level, around the corner from Planet Hollywood, just past Buffalo Wild Wings. We had the fiesta nachos and they did not disappoint. It's a mountain of nachos that's easily enough for two hungry (and slightly drunk) people. Our server, Ryan, was awesome. Check in on Yelp for a free margarita - pretty great considering the steep drink prices on the Strip.",1.0
"Mad respect for new exec chef Justin who brings a lot of talent and passion to Atomic.  His rustic refined cooking is something that has been sorely missing from Vegas for a long time.  Haven't had a chance to work through much of the menu yet, but Kingsley Wing is great, harrissa carrots a classic  (coriander cream, yum), and the Cuban is a flavor bomb of porky goodness.  Chef is also a madman, already putting out fantastic specials nonstop.  The chicken livers with mushroom ravioli and greens was amazing.

Drinks are also fantastic.  Should sell the Glass Onion as an aromatic mist to be enjoyed throughout the day.    And be careful you don't get so loaded your inner fat kid starts crushing bread pudding at the bar ""to sober up.",1.0

My favorite part about Sol is the patio...they have lights strung across and there is an enclosed fire pit area with plenty of seating.

"If you are tired of not finding the ""right"" suit, you can design it yourself. Basically every part is customizable and then tailored to your measurements.

I have super sensitive eyes that would water so much at the other threading places I've gone to, but I never have that problem here.

"My mother and I came here for a day of relaxation and used the wonderful spa\/treatment services Laya has to offer. After a bit of confusion at the beginning, the treatments itself were just what we needed. If you're looking for truly unique and invigorating treatments, this is the right place. 

However, what sticks with a client when recommending to a friend\/family is that little extra, which here was lacking. My mother customized her treatment package from head-to-toe (literally) and was happy to pay the price tag that came with it. Five Laya Spa packages serve a light lunch, but because my mother customized her package, this extra is not usually included. My mother was at Laya from early afternoon till evening, paid $500, and even after I requested lunch for her, I was told they would not include it. I paid $24 extra (for a salad bowl) so that she wouldn't go through the day hungry. This does not leave a good lasting impression on clients, nor warrants for that 5-star rating.",1.0

Excellent displays from Rock and Roll's start out of Gospel and blues all the way to the modern sync pop of today. Wonderful wardrobes from performers like Nick Jagger, Jemi Hendrix, David Bowie and Lady Gaga. Also, they have displays of pioneers like the inventor of the electric guitar (Led Paul) and other devices that have modernized today's music. They have a nice cafeteria to grab a bite to eat and a drink, but it is a tad expensive. Really fun and energetic staff that wants you to have the best experience possible. In addition, they have a really nice gift shop with a music section containing CDs and LPs from most types of music.",1.0

"Updated review for the new location. 

Same awesome food, same reasonable prices, same great service. Ambiance still comfortable and mostly unpretentious -- the new building is much bigger, with pool tables and much more seating, plus bonus high ceilings with exposed ductwork for extra hipster cred. 

The only downside is the parking. I was a HUGE fan of the old location in the unpretentious, crummy-fabulous Commerical Center; this new spot is a slight bitch if you're driving a car. There is street parking in the Arts District, which depending on day\/time might be free....and there's a big free lot across Charleston, by the Arts Factory. But you can't just park out front and walk in, like at the old place. (Tip: there is a back entrance, so if you do park in the Arts district, you can come in thru the rear alley instead of walking all the way around the block to the front.) Also, there is no bike rack...but we locked our bikes to the iron railing next door, which seemed to be OK.

But the parking inconveniences are made up for by the improved people-watching: big plate-glass windows up front offer a primo view of the crazy pedestrian traffic on Charleston. 

I have probably tried 75% of the menu so far, and it has all been excellent! I will definitely be back.",1.0

"We arrived at B & B Ristorante and were seated after a short wait. 

I chose the restaurant because it was my friend's birthday, Mario Batali is one of her favorite chef's and I wanted her day to be special. Yes, I know he's not there but he picked the chef so it's almost the same as having Mario make the meal.

I have to say the service is impeccable and you're definitely made to feel special during your dining experience, which stands to reason based on the prices, good thing nothing's  to good for my BFF.

Once seated, our server came over immediately and welcomed us. We were given time to look at the menu after our drink order.

Omg, can I say the Blood Orange Cosmo 
I've seen Mario mix on the chew and my drink of choice for the evening was the best Cosmo I've had to date.

The bread was good and the olive oil & balsamic vinegar mixture made it so much better.

We had to try the pasta while here because not doing so would've been a crime. We ordered the Paglia e Fieno and I have to say, having spent 3 weeks in Italy and indulging in the finest pasta, this dish brought me back to Italy, it was exceptional, we enjoyed every glorious bite.

Now for our main course we ordered the B&B Dry Aged Ribeye for Two with Roasted Potatoes, it took 45 minutes to cook and while it was tasty, in my opinion, it should've been much more tender and easier to chew. The olive oil & balsamic vinegar gave the steak that extra special touch that made it really good.

The potatoes & zucchini were good too, definitely a meal to remember.

I'm happy my friend finally used the word delicious instead of ok when saying how she enjoyed her meal.

If you have $300 to spare, try B & B, I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience too!

"For a sandwich shop that is tucked away in an inconspicuous space in front of Scotiabank Theatre, it may be easy to miss.  However, after one visit, you'll say it has its own swagger.  The first thing you'll be doing is eyeing the stylelized graphics in  its tiny 200 sq ft space. Food and art collide here, and I'm not talking about the kind of art with cute, humanoid foods donning faces.  I'm talking about street art, as demonstrated by the graffiti of a large sammie  scrawled on the back wall.  Also, you'll enjoy a lively chat with the owner who passionately discusses about his cooking and who will, as a result, make you salivate even more while you wait for your order.  Coupled with the cooking shows\/videos playing in the background, you'll be on the edge of your seat from hunger.  My gosh, the hunger pangs hurt even more when the owner drips the meat jus onto your porchetta sandwich in front of you!  However, just keep in mind that with patience you'll be generously rewarded with a hefty sandwich exploding with meaty flavour and a great balance of textures.  The porchetta sammie I ordered for Mealpal was a show stopper for me. It was juicy, soft, crispy, super-sized, and in all fairness a gastric journey for a discounted price of 5 dollars.  It was a million tiers above Subways and Mr.Sub. Just be mindful of the price, as its regular costs outside of Mealpal may bring it down a notch for you. Yeah, these sammies got style.",1.0

"With very little time (4 months) to get my wedding together, there were no engagement photos, and I almost skipped a photographer for the wedding.  I came across 3 Oceans Entertainment by chance and boy am I glad I did!  I emailed them through Yelp and got a response within days of reaching out.  I was so glad they were able to ""pencil me in"" with such short notice and at such a reasonable price!
After an email or two, including the contract signing, it was all set up and payments were being scheduled.  They made everything super easy (which makes for less stress and a happy bride).  Robbie texted me when we both needed some clarification or had questions for each other.  They emailed me invoices that were payable through Paypal and they were flexible when necessary.
The day of the wedding, I couldn't have asked for a better tag team than Cameron and Robbie.  They were patient and easy to work with.  They were put under a bit of a time crunch that brought on some stress (mostly from me) but they rolled with it and everything I asked for was done.  They didn't let up on their fun attitudes and professionalism as needed.  I will look back on my wedding day and remember how both were a big part of me not losing my head from the problems that arose.  I cannot thank them enough.
Should I ever have photography needs in the future, I won't ever have to search again.  They are easy to get along with and really listen to questions and concerns.  Best people for the best price with the best attitude and results.",1.0

Overall a great dining experience with one caveat.  Started our Gallagher's experience at the exterior bar waiting for friends and the staff there could not have been better.  Had two ""Sand In Your Toes"" cocktails which got the party started.  The staff were pleasant and attentive.  

For dinner the Cowboy rib-eye steak was perfect.  20oz of aged beef on the bone was perfect to share with the wife.  In fact, the wait staff split the starter caesar salad and steak at our table without making a big deal about it like other restaurants.  Loaded mashed potatoes and colossal baked potato were great sides as well.  

Now on to the 1 downer.  Checked in 15 minutes early to the hostess and was told harshly ""just come back when your whole party shows up.""  Um...okay, just wanted to let you know, but I digress.  Friends showed up and we went back to the hostess station with everyone and was told ""would you like a booth, we had one open up and it will be ready in just a minute.""  OK.  10 minutes later, it's going to be just 5 minutes.  10 more minutes, it's going to be just a few more minutes.  5 more minutes go by.  I don't mind waiting for a great experience, but I do mind waiting 30 minutes past my reservation when half of the restaurant is empty.  If you're short staffed or don't know how to clean a table just tell me because I'm a grown up and can take the truth.  I'm standing 5 feet away from the two useless hostesses who have no problem talking and gossiping, but can't properly explain to me why we're standing in front of a half-empty restaurant with a useless reservation time. 

Gallagher's deserves it's #1 rating on Yelp because it's that good.  Great food and great service.

I almost walked away because of it and I'm sure others have too.",1.0

They do not carry the inventory of a bigger Walmart.  They have the basics and a few other items but that is it. I enjoy my trips to the Waterworks Walmart.

"Last Friday, my team from work went to Emerald for dim sum for lunch. I drove three of my colleagues over to the restaurant. My other colleague took two others. 

I decided to go against Google Maps. Sometimes, I wonder how useful it is to do a u-turn instead of turning left at the intersection. 

This plaza gets busy. We got there just before noon, so we were fine. 

We got a round table. There were seven of us. We got tea while we waited for the dim sum carts to cycle. 

We ordered a whack load of dishes during our first five minutes of being there! So much for pacing how much we eat. 

The dim sum was delicious. Some of my favourites are the following:
- Crab claw balls (so good, especially the meat in the claw)
- Har gow
- Sticky rice in fragrant leaves
- Rice rolls (shrimp and barbeque)

I had so much protein that I enjoyed the gai lan with fish. I ate more greens than the one sliver of fish. 

We split the bill. Each person ended up paying $22, which included the tip. I was good with it. My boss said that it was expensive. This restaurant accepts credit, debit, and cash. 

The dim sum quality was amazing. This restaurant houses a ton of people. At one point, a tour bus full of tourists came in. I would guess that it easily seats 200 people. 

I'd come back here again. It's fully licensed, which is another reason why I need to come back.

"Downtown for First Friday and was meeting friends at Desoto. I ordered from Adobo because they had an interesting menu. They were having a happy hour for First Friday so I ordered a bao. Had no idea what that was but when I asked the server said the veggie version was vegan. Ordered it and it was so good. It was a mini sandwich with sautéed veggies and mushrooms. The veggies were really well seasoned and the best part was the sandwich bread was steamed. It was puffy and light and the sandwich tasted super fresh. The restaurant is in an in door marketplace and you order at the counter. It's like a fancy food court. There is seating inside, outside and inside there are two levels of seating. This is a great spot for meeting up with a large groups and if people have different things they want to want to eat. When I came it was busier than usual because there was also a crafts market going on. They had jewelry, clothes, and stalls selling baklava to support Syrian refugees.

"You will find me here many weekends. I visit here for the dog park. It is bit even the closest dog park to me and I make the drive. My dog loves it here.  Lots of space for your dog to run around and lots of fur friends to play with. Maybe too many sometimes that even my dog can get a little overwhelmed. They have two lots. One designed for 20 lbs and over and another for smaller dogs.  

Two main items I want to point out:
- the dog park is not the easiest to find. You drive to the back and once when you make the turn to park you will see s trail that leads down into the woods Or you will see another path if you walk down the path left of the basketball court. Maybe the signs could be more clear. Have had other visitors ask how to get to the dog park as we were leaving.

"I've been here at least four times. The service is always really nice, and I actually was referred this place by a friend. I like the chic atmosphere. Make an appointment! This place is so busy and you don't want to waste your time waiting! There's a T.V. you can watch. They play Pop music. Their massage chairs work (not like some other places in town).",1.0
"I highly recommended this hotel. It's off the strip which is a huge plus because you don't have crowds of random people who are just gambling running around.
My husband and I stayed in the HRH tower which has the nicest rooms you can get at the Hard Rock but the furniture is pretty beat up. You can tell they have had some crazy parties in there. 
Also they have snacks in your room you could purchase. They had an intimacy kit and head phones that were $40-$50 each. I was picking up everything trying the find the headphones I couldn't see. I was making sure they were there so I wouldn't get charged. Just so you know, once you pickup the item you are immediately charged. So be careful.",1.0
This place is yummy! Food is so good and fresh. Cooked to perfection. The staff is very friendly and I believe family owned. I see the reviews of when they first opened and believe like any starting business they just needed to work the kinks out. I highly recommend this place.,1.0
"Came here for a Biag of donuts, ended up with an entire Box. The tragedy is that most people in Cleveland have never been here, whereas I detour hours out of my way, and even sleep in my car with an alarm set for 4am, so I can wake up right when they're open and the Crulers are piping hot and gooey, and get a ton of them, and in 1 minute and 41 seconds, ruin all the efforts put in during my workouts for the last 4 weeks. How does Cleveland not know about these? OK, some do, but there should be 500 reviews. Is it because they are out of the way? Well my b***hole is out of the way but it doesn't stop people messing with it during foreplay, amirite?

What to get: Crulers
Just Crulers: Yes. I was going to keep them a secret, but that would be Cruler than anything.

But you have to try them when they're hot. Which means you have to come at 4am. Are you willing to do that for a donut? Once you try it hot you will thank me. It's not the same microwaved. It's just nottttttt. You may even agree once you try it fresh from its mother donut's womb. Come here and rob the cradle. Do the donut equivalent of Spanish Suckling Pig. You damn well motherf***ing know you want to you donut-obsessed donut sl**. Oh you like that donut do you? Oh you like it a bit too much don't you. Mmmhmm.

A-hem. Where was I.

A movie was filmed here. ""Cruler Intentions."" If you're wondering where to put your Cruler, if it tastes this good... you can put it anywhere.

So these Crulers. Easily the best I've ever had. Always come around 4am for them (or whenever they are fresh out of the oven, sometimes a little earlier or later than that), because when these babies are hot and gooey, they will be one of the best things you ever tasted.

I come here a lot in the summers when I visit Cleveland. It's a Cruler summer, leaving me here eating donuts.

Located far in the distant East Burbs of Cleveland, who knew you'd find one of the best things in food history. Their coffee is good too, and some of their other donuts are not bad. But oh, those heavenly Crulers, hot and gooey, the greatest in the world. They taste like clouds. Bonus points for good service and not minding me sleeping in their parking lot.

And Demi Lovato loves these too (although you wouldn't know it to look at her lately). That's why she did a song about them: ""Cruler For The Summer.""

If you didn't already get the hint... get to Biagios AT 4AM and not any other time, and try them when they're hot.

Donut go anywhere near NE Ohio without trying the Crulers when hot. Inspired the Jamaican Donut-laden Bobsled movie: Cruler Runnings.",1.0

"This place is a hidden gem! Omg! Staff was friendly, samples were delicious, history lessons were hard to follow after a few samples, and the ginger-lemon vinegar was awesome! The sangria was amazing and the treats they left out for sampling was amazing. I bought the Lime Liquor which was my fav! And I couldn't leave there without a bottle! Also, you're able to reuse the bottles for oil or vinegar which is a great concept for recycling! Love this gem! I'll definitely be back! I'm so happy I stopped in when I did!

"Whiskey Rose is my new favorite hang out at Westgate. It fills two items on my checklist which are: Good food and quick service. Plus it's literally steps away from the entrance to Gila River Arena.

There is more to Whiskey Rose though. It's got some character and they clearly support a variety of sports and teams, including the Coyotes. Plus there is a great patio for enjoying the weather in the fall. The downside is you're competing with the joints on either side who believe 'loud' equals 'atmosphere'.

The menu is still new to me, but I saw plenty I would like to try on my next visit, particularly the 1\/2 lb. BLT. And even though there wasn't a lot of BBQ sauce on my grilled chicken sandwich, I could tell the sauce was pretty good. Plus, the jalapeño cornbread was amazing!

Because of the convenience, the above average menu and the great service provided by Kiley, I predict that me and my hockey ensemble will be frequenting Whiskey Rose in the near future.",1.0

"Kids portions are HUGE! Food is always served hot and fresh. 

I have had great servers but seems service support is sometimes a step behind, which causes the server to get unnecessarily weeded and the table to not get essentials: waiting almost 5 minutes after being seated to get a highchair (which we requested when checking in with the host stand), the bread basket not being dropped off until requested and after our entree hit the table) or water refills...

I still give it 5 stars for my servers always being pleasant, helpful and friendly and because the food has always been on point.",1.0
"Shopped here for many-a-present for my wife. Quality and uniqueness of their goods  is impressive.  The staff are also very friendly and helpful in making a selection. The only thing preventing me from providing five stars is their very strict return policy, they really need to revisit this.",1.0

Je n'ai pas pris rendez-vous pour une épilation au fil des sourcils, ce n'est pas nécessaire apparement, il faut juste prendre rendez-vous pour les services un peu plus long, comme un facial.

"Stopped at a few other Nail Salons, and found this Salon to be everything I was looking for and more. The Husband Wife team were so cute, I regret not getting her name, but knowing the location is enough. It is a family owned business and you get real good energy when you walk in.

"In Vegas for a conference and was dying to get away from the casino's and the overpriced crap. My sister, a Las Vegas local, told me we were getting Thai and picked me up. Just down the street from where I'm staying, the price was cheap, the portions were large and the food was fantastic. It's a very small spot and kind of unassuming as it's tucked on the side of one of the shopping centers but if you get a chance I highly recommend you seek it out. Panang was fantastic, the heats still making my face red.",1.0
"I came here 6 days after their grand opening to celebrate my work place achievement and we were very pleased with quality of food we had for lunch.

I was looking for some nice lunch place to take my team, and knew it had to be somewhere to satisfy foodie colleagues, I thought this newly opened place will be perfect.

Inside this restaurant is very gorgeous. I thought this place will be ideal for after work get together. 

Since our server and actually everyone else is new, I would say server was still learning about their restaurant. He knew about the menu but not to the level I asked. I did end up talking to both chefs at the end and food served made sense. A main chef is from Thai and another is originally from Korea. Based on menu availability, that was my guess and we ordered accordingly. All the food we ordered was really tasty and well flavored. 

Fried rice made by Korean chef tasted like real fried rice should taste, curry had authentic curry flavor, poke had good taste and fish was fresh. Curry came with small serving of rice, we ended up with extra curry sauce and was told later by the chef that I should have asked for more rice... 

Portion size was rather small for the price you pay. In fact, everything was a tad pricey. If not for that special occasion, it won't be my regular lunch place. I guess we pay for the ambiance? 

I really liked their food. Although server was slow but it was shortly after grand opening. I would wait just bit more before coming back to try some of their interesting menu options.",1.0
"What a beautiful space, tucked away in the lucky dragon hotel. Our server was lovely and we came at an off time and had the place to ourselves. The seating was comfortablel. 
Our tea ceremony was lovely, and our server took time to have us smell the tea and explain what she was doing every step of the way. One pot was easily shared among two people, and they offer sake drinks as well, and some small fruit and sweet nuts to snack on. All in all a fantastic experience.",1.0
"This is a good place. Lot of offerings. Sushi was my fav incl fresh seaweed salad. A wow 4 shelf of desserts. Brisket was meh, good seafood but simply made. Did not try breakfast stuff or italian. Korean was too salty. Latin has some nice peppers

Place is quite big. My fav approach, go and take my time, reading a book and making it a multi course meal.",1.0
"Friendly, helpful staff with a variety of quality DME products.  They even had some stuff that I didn't know existed but really has proved helpful.",1.0
"Soco is a cute spot connected to the Delta Hotel. I liked that the menu was quite simple. I tried the mac and cheese with braised beef and a friend had the burger with fries. After 10pm, the dinner menu turns into a late night snack menu, where portions are smaller, but prices remain the same. Before going to Soco, I've read many reviews and had high expectations for their award-winning mac and cheese. I was not disappointed. I think adding the braised beef makes the dish sooo much better. The mac and cheese is REALLY heavy and cheesy. And thats why I would not complain about the portion size being smaller than their drink glass. Adding a fresh element or even a tiny side salad would help cut the amount of fat you can literally feel yourself consuming. (Not complaining, this dish would satisfy any mac and cheese craving for months!)
The burger and fries were a big portion. The burger came with 2 beef patties and they were huge. Fries had a nice crunch to it. Service was fine and staff were accommodating.",1.0

"I came into Smith Bros for their Thursday special. This steakhouse is located in a big box plaza in Scarborough, it has a decent warehouse like vibe for a rather uneventful location that is in the land of the car.

The $30 special comes with a drink, appetizer and an entree. They call it ""three course"" but I really don't feel a drink is a course.

I got their own beer, it was actually quite good, and I would consider buying it at Beer Store if they sell it there. I got some beef soup that was decent. The main course was a steak and fries. It was nicely grilled and comes with shoestring fries. I think the steak was made from sous vide and then it was grilled afterwards. I didn't think it was amazing, but the steak itself was quite good, it was one of the better steak experiences I've had.

The service was exceptional. Would come again for a special occasion.",1.0

"Holy cow. This place is legit! 

Being a snooty foodie in Southwest Las Vegas is tough... there really aren't any upscale restaurants with good food. Pier 215 is probably the closest thing we have to upscale but the food is just A-OK. 

I saw The Black Sheep when I was on a Skinny Fats food run and thought I'd look it up... after seeing the photos and reviews, my boyfriend and I came in for a happy hour to give it a try and  holy shiitake mushrooms was the food incredible!!

The Vietnamese Imperial rolls-- absolutely incredible. Tasty crispy outside with a warm delicious inside.

West Coast Oysters-- Not big weird oysters... succulent smaller treats that are buttery and flavorful with no fishy flavor. (Only $1 for happy hour, score!)

Bao Sliders-- Orgasmic. Don't be afraid of the quail egg, it's just like a regular egg, only smaller. These little sliders have so much flavor it's incredible. One of the best sliders I've ever had. An absolute must try!

Watermelon, Burrata, and Tomato salad-- this too was incredible. Tasty frisee and delicious fresh tomatos. The watermelon... perfect. They could have given a bit more burrata, but I'm kind of a sucker for cheese! Delicious.

Hanger Steak-- Now I've never been a fan of skirt steaks or hanger steaks. TBH, I've always thought they were inferior cuts of meat being peddled as hip, new cuts to try. This hanger steak is the best think to happen to me in EONS! The steak was incredible! Juicy, tender... perfect might not be too strong of a word lol. The sweet corn was also incredible.

I was greeted by everyone behind the counter with reassurance I had chosen the right place.  Welcoming smiles across the board.  I opted for the ""well Fed"" meal which gives you 4 portions of meats and two sides.  I added a point of chicken as well.  While the chicken which was tossed in a mustard base sauce was tasty I won't mess around again and will go straight for the brisket.  My kids called it 'bacon like meat'. Probably not the most appetizing description but the taste was out of this world!
The collards are tasty with a nice kick and the beans are insanely good!!  Did I mention how good the brisket is?!  I mean it doesn't even need sauce good!

"Auf unserer Rundreise haben wir häufig die Restaurantkette In-n-Out Burger besucht, die mit dem Versprechen ""Quality You Can Taste"" wirbt. In Las Vegas , an der Sahara Avenue, sind wir eingekehrt, da die Filiale am Strip total überlaufen ist. Im Internet konnte ich nachlesen, dass es das Unternehmen bereits seit 1948 gibt und es mittlerweile ca. 300 Restaurants im Westen der USA und Texas gibt.

Am späten Abend war hier der Andrang nur mittelmäßig. Die Auswahl war einfach, da es nur drei verschiedene Burger und Pommes zur Auswahl gibt. Wenn man es dann zur Bestellung geschafft hat, bekommt man eine Nummer, die dann aufgerufen wird sobald die Bestellung fertig ist.

Auf die Burger kommt nur gekühltes und kein gefrorenes Frischfleisch, das von der eigenen Fleischfabrik innerhalb von 24 Stunden geliefert wird. Die Kartoffeln für die Pommes werden im Restaurant aus frischen Kartoffeln hergestellt. Ich konnte es selber in der offenen Küche sehen, wie ein Mitarbeiter die Kartoffeln geschält und gewürfelt hat.

Preislich bewegt man sich trotzdem weit unten, da man auf eine umfangreiche Auswahl verzichtet. Wenn man mit mehreren Leuten hier einkehrt, sollten die anderen ein Plätzchen im Restaurant sichern, da diese zu den Stoßzeiten ebenfalls rar sind.

Vor den meisten Läden findet man zwei gepflanzte Palmen, die gekreuzt wachsen und eine Anspielung auf den Lieblingsfilm des Inhabers ""Eine total, total verrückte Welt"" sein sollen. Eine weitere Marotte sind angedruckte Bibelstellen auf den Unterseiten der Getränkebecher.

From the smooth check-in and onwards, we had the pleasure of Lori's company the entire time. Lori was very high energy and extremely engaged in our group's activities. She coached us for each of the three we chose: knives, axes, and archery. She was definitely a huge component of the awesome time my group had there! Lori made sure we had the opportunity to choose music, and further customize the experience. She had extra lanes opened since we were the only group there, and offered fun activities for us. She even brought out her own knives and axes for us to try! 

I will definitely return to this location, just for Lori. We didn't interact with many of the other staff, but they were friendly as well.

A simple but homemade menu with excellent service and a cozy environment.  Fresh sandwiches, soup, and baked goods are what you can expect to find at the small café. The owners are very kind and personable.  They clearly care about their café, their customers, and community. After ordering I noticed a small hand written sign at the counter indicating that anyone who will be spending Thanksgiving alone is welcome to come and join them for dinner at the café which they will provide at no charge (donations accepted but not required)- that shows care and commitment to the community.  My first visit was great and I will be back.",1.0

"For my first review of 2017, I want to start off with a 5 star provider that helped make my Christmas holidays stress free. As the holidays approached, it became apparent that I was going to be travelling out of the province for an extended time and my normal cat sitting friends weren't going to be available.
I looked online and narrowed down my potential cat sitting services to 3 companies. Despite there being a lower Yelp review count than I typically lean too, I'm so happy I settled on PetsGo. Let me tell you why...

1) Professionalism
From the first visit to the Petsgo website, including being one of the few cat sitters with a mobile friendly website, integrated logos and youtube content, I could see that this company was investing into being a credible and professional business. 
Throw in quick response time to inquiries, a client portal for booking appointments and inputting pet info, and clear indications of insurance and animal association involvement, I had a good feeling right out of the gates. Payment is also easily workable through email money transfer or credit card online.

2) Trust
From the first time meeting Sarah and her husband Jake during the introductory meeting where they met my cat and we signed some forms, I had good vibes from them. You could see right from the first visit that they are animal people. My cat instantly took to them, which naturally gave me good peace of mind when I was officially giving them access to my house with all my possessions and my favourite non-human creature.

3) Communication
Despite having a few weeks between when I needed to have them start cat sitting, any inquiries or discussion points we had between those times were easily communicated during that time. More importantly, during every day I was gone they send daily update emails that included a summary of the days play time and pictures. Seeing pictures of your animal being happy while you're gone certainly gives a feeling of freedom to go about my travels without concerns.

I could go on, but the bottom line is that my vacation was awesome and this was way better than the times I've simply left my friends to cat sit, hoping during that time that everything is going according to plan. 
While I can't personally speak to their other services, I will encourage any west enders in need of various cat sitting\/dog walking\/puppy visits to give PetsGo a try, as it was nothing but good things to say from my own experience.",1.0

"Marigold Madison is probably my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area. The lunch thali platters are amazing! Each one comes with a bread, thin crackers, and different assortments of small dishes such as lentil soup, curry, salad, chickpeas, and rice pudding.

"My boyfriend and I decided on a gender reveal in July. Unfortunately, since we're still brand new to the Vegas we wouldn't be able to get a scheduled Ultrasound visit through our OB\/GYN in time for our party. 
That's when we decided to check out Miracles in Progress. They have an awesome Yelp deal so definitely put it to use. 
Upon arriving the lady at the front desk greeted me and had me fill at a form. My package came with a CD of what was seen on my ultrasound along with a choice of music to choose from. The waiting room was beautifully set up. I maybe waited around for 5 minutes or so before they called me back into the ultrasound room. Now these rooms aren't like your typical doctors offices. It was a very LARGE room with sofas, dimmed lights, and a 60"" (or more) screen TV which we would be viewing our ultrasound on. And the bed I laid on was very comfortable. My ultrasound tech was very nice and every once in awhile would lightly push on my tummy to get baby awake and moving. You should've seen! Baby was hopping and jumping around like crazy! It was very entertaining! Once it was time to check out the gender she would turn off the TV to keep it a surprise, printed out the ultrasound picture with the gender and placed it in an envelope. She then turned the TV back on and continued on with out appointment. I would say we were in the room for a good 15-20 minutes. Not too sure what the other reviews meant by being felt ""rushed""? 
We returned back in the waiting room and a few minutes later my CD and pictures were ready for me to take home. I absolutely loved how they came out! The silhouette of my baby was very pronounced and I could even see my baby's little nose and ears. Again, I'm kinda confused with the other reviews saying that they had horrible quality photos. I mean, your baby is still developing. The pictures aren't gonna turn out looking like Mona Lisa. These photos are strictly for ENTERTAINMENT purposes. 
Anyways, I'll definitely be returning. Maybe closer to the ending of my pregnancy.",1.0

"In the past, I have had a hard time finding an automotive repair shop that I can trust to do the job properly, explain all costs upfront and perform the repair at a price I can afford.

I called on a Monday, explained my situation and the friendly staff let me know they could get it looked at on Tuesday. I dropped my car off in the morning on Tuesday and they were done by 3pm the same day.

The staff was amazing at diagnosing and inspecting my the vehicle. They gave me extremely detailed information that was actually useful and easy to understand.  As an amateur mechanic I had some idea what was wrong, but seeing the report and pictures of the issue I knew with confidence that they were professionals that prided themselves in their work.

I will definitely be giving them my business when there are repairs that I can not handle!

"My family was hungry for pizza Saturday night and we looked on Yelp to help us find somewhere new for us,  The reviews for Pizza My Dear were great so we figured to give them a shot.  When we arrived we weren't aware there were only two tables as this is a mainly pick up and delivery location but the staff was extremely accommodating.  We grabbed a couple of menus and decided on Jalapeno poppers, a small Hawaii 5-O, and a large New York style with Pepperoni, Mushrooms (HUGE), Green Peppers, and Garlic.  We also ordered a six pack of Pepsi for $4.99 that saved us a ton compared to going to a sit-down place at $3 per drink.  Everything came out hot as we were right there and it was fantastic!  Thanks to the great staff who checked on us and gave us a wonderful experience.",1.0

"At Hollywood Gelato, I have ""been there done that"" for their gelato many times for at least 7 years. During this time, I have also eaten the gelato at the nearby competition and other gelato shops in the GTA. I have learned how different gelato shops make their ice creams. To this day, I still find Hollywood Gelato the best gelato shop in its area. One of their nearby competitors, years ago, once said that they don't make real Italian gelato. I guess that meant I was eating Canadian Italian gelato.

I am giving Hollywood Gelato a rating of 3.5 stars instead of 4 stars since they still don't offer a gelato stamp card while they have offered a coffee stamp card for years. Gelato customers spend just as much money as coffee customers!

I have eaten most of the gelato and sorbet flavours offered at Hollywood Gelato. My favourite gelato flavours in no particular order are: cappuccino, coconut cream pie, hazelnut, key lime pie, Sicilian pistachio, pumpkin pie (available at Thanksgiving). I am lactose intolerant, but my stomach can handle the gelato. I didn't list any chocolate flavours even though I love chocolate as I satisfied with eating chocolate ice cream bought from supermarkets. I want gelato and sorbet experiences where the flavour cannot be bought from supermarket ice cream. My favourite sorbet flavours in no particular order are: lemon, wild forest berries, mango, and raspberry. The sorbets are lactose free.

I decided to pig out today, February 19th, since my last visit was around last Thanksgiving Day. I ordered mango sorbet, strawberry sorbet, Skor gelato and Reese peanut butter gelato for $7.50 including tax. I loved the mango sorbet. You get the real taste of mangoes and it is not too sweet. I made a mistake ordering strawberry sorbet. I meant to order raspberry gelato, but the server already scooped the strawberry gelato. The strawberry gelato lacked a strong taste. Is it because they used U.S. strawberries instead of better tasting, sweet Ontario strawberries when they are in season. Order the raspberry sorbet instead of the strawberry sorbet. The Skor gelato and Reese peanut butter gelato were OK. I usually don't order chocolate flavoured gelatos for the reason given above.

Not feeling totally satisfied with my gelato experience today, I ordered 2 more scoops. I got key lime pie gelato and Sicilian pistachio gelato in a cup for $5.50 including tax. There was a definite bite of real lime juice in the key lime pie. Also, I could tell there was pie crust in the key lime pie as I chewed. The Sicilian pistachio had a rich flavour, which I liked. These are 2 of my favourite flavours at Hollywood Gelato.

I like Hollywood Gelato so much that I bought gift certificates for myself as a Christmas present in previous years lol. It was a good deal.

I read the Yelp good and bad reviews for Hollywood Gelato. Other customers may have experienced rude customer service, but in the 7 plus years of being a Hollywood Gelato customer I have never had an issue with their customer service. I have been there when it's very busy and when it's empty and there were no problems. Yelp is a popular social media app to make compliants about customer service, but what about making compliants about customers. During my latest visit, I observed a rude customer yell, ""There's no one to take my money!"". Instead, she could have said, ""Hello"" or ""Excuse me"". Was it really that necessary to be so nasty?

Otherwise, I left Hollywood Gelato :-), but a bit full.",1.0
Stinky's is just all around amazing!! I definitely be using them from now and highly recommend them to everyone! I am a new jeep owner and had to get a new jeep top for my wrangler!

"Good food. We go here or order delivery a couple of times a month because it's so close to our house. Counter staff never seem to be particularly interested in being friendly but if you can get past someone staring at you as a ""greeting"", and they don't seem to have anyone assigned to wiping down the tables during the lunch rush, but otherwise, the food is worth with your time.

If you need some direction on what to try, give the Smokey Mountain a go. I find it to be better without onion; may just be my own preference. A cup of tomato bisque soup compliments it nicely.

Delivery seems to be hit and miss. Had some problems with delivery orders being ""forgot"", but they'd comp my meal and deliver it a few minutes later, and neither myself nor the roommate has had our order ""forgotten"" in a couple of months now. Perhaps they've rectified whatever was causing that?",1.0

Divine Skin Spa is great! The staff is very friendly and professional every time I come in. The estheticians give great facials and the masseuses give great massages. Not much more you can ask for. I highly recommend this spa.,1.0
"Went for brunch and the place was overrun with babies! I mean, they were cute, but the one next to me had decided to that the sweet pastry option needed to be crumbled all over the floor and table. Nice to know that they have high-chairs and are family friendly, ready to clean up after your messy kids. 

Had the pumpkin pancakes... and oh boy, they not only were hearty, but there were five? six? full-on pancake with the walnuts and chantilly cream. And they were drenched in syrup. Not that I'm complaining, I just felt terrible that I could only eat half of the meal.

The Fritatta was also good, nice and eggy, with lots of fresh ingredients. My guy and I shared the healthy pastry (a small mini loaf that was delish!) as an appetizer, but we were both struggling to finish our individual meals, and I rarely see this guy struggle when it comes to food. 

Honestly, I think if the portions were a wee bit smaller, or if I knew how heavy the pancakes were going to be, I would have had a better time.

Great service though, especially in regards to all the kiddies. Everyone is so nice. Originally was going to give it three stars, but the service and the pastries push it up a level. Seriously loved that mini loaf!!",1.0
"I ate here a couple of weeks ago and I tell you it was the best prime rib I've ever had, the meat cut like butter, and was simply delicious.

Cooked to perfection! 

Our server was quite friendly, helpful and informative, and was prompt with responding to anything we may have needed. The matri d paid us a visit and she was very friendly and amusing, we had a delightful five minute conversation. All in all, a delightful dinner!

"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Altius a few days ago.  It was a really nice experience. 
We did not get a table by the window, but we could still see some of the view and they gave us a nice curved booth, so we were happy and able to talk comfortably. 

The food was very good, with properly sized portions. 
I had the sea bass and my husband had rib eye. We started with crab toast.  The crab toast was so good I could've just made a meal out of that. 
Service was provided by Lilah, and she was very good. Professional, but very personable. Pretentious waitstaff is  always unpleasant. Lilah was very friendly and made us feel welcome. She even offered to move us to a window at dessert, but we were fine. 

I would be remiss if I did not mention the chocolate bourbon ball. My husband does not drink often. He ended his meal with this and it was lovely. We both said we could just sit at their bar and drink those. 
All in all a great experience. We will probably be back at some point.",1.0

"Had this mad craving for spaghetti the other day, so I hit up this place on Yelp. They had an amazing online catalogue in which everything looked delicious, and I ended up ordering 1 pasta, 1 pizza, 1 salad, plus 1 desert. Yes, all for me;)
Of the 4 items, my favorite was by far the salad. Which was a surprise since salad isn't even real food in my books!! THAT's how good it was. It had strawberries and veggies in it, and came with the most delicious dressing EVER. A perfect balance of sweetness and sourness, and the texture was just incredible. The first bite reminded me of home, and I'm not even Italian!! Strawberry salad, you may just have converted me, I am officially a salad-lover now.
The other three items were sadly forgettable. The pasta was way too creamy, and they didn't even have vinegar in the kitchen?? Pizza was okay, only had potatoes on it so it was kinda boring. For dessert I chose panna cotta, and again, it was very rich. Fortunately the blueberrries on the side had enough sourness to balance it out, as I managed to finish this one.
Overall it was a solid meal, nothing was particularly bad, and that salad REALLY stood out. The interior was nice, lots of natural light and food that actually look appetizing! And you just gotta love the price. Will definitely return again to try out other items on the menu:)",1.0

Everything on the menu is really good, almost all homemade and they have great daily specials. My families favorites are the Swiss Steak Dinner on Wednesday's and the 8 oz. Steak Dinner on Saturday's. 

Do you like soup's? River City has the best!! Every day there are at least 5 or more to choose from and they are all homemade. Pair that with a couple of their oakies and you won't be disappointed.

"This place has a very cool outdoor patio with misters and shade that is awesome almost all year, I suspect. The atmosphere is very hipster-scottsdale-classy. This is a popular spot due to its prime location on Shea & Scottsdale so it is a bit more noisy than average. The prices are on par with most other Scottsdale locations, a little bit on the pricier side. I had the Dutch Apple French Toast ($12 after tax). The French toast was just two huge pieces of Texas toast with some apples on it, no sides. The French toast was very good, albeit a little overpriced. So all in all, a solid Scottsdale Breakfast spot with a hipster atmosphere similar to Hash Kitchen.",1.0

"Excellent neighborhood Italian restaurant! Terrific sauces, entrees, starters and a wide number of options on the menu. We usually get a stromboli instead of a pizza when we're ordering to go - always good! When we eat in, we often get one of the specials. Had the scallops in white wine pesto cream sauce tonight -it was great! Good, team oriented service in a family owned and operated restaurant. They never disappoint.",1.0
"Amazing food and service! We went for ""all you can eat"" Sunday brunch. Even though it was all you can eat, the quality was still there. You get to choose anything on the starters menu, however they will only bring you two at a time. We had sushi, oatmeal, the sweet breads, and my favorite the black bean hummus. (There was more to choose from, we just had to stop so we could continue on the menu!) next, you choose one item from the main dish, and then you may choose all side dishes (they have 4). I got the Cuban breakfast sandwich, which was delicious! My husband chose a brisket meal, which he enjoyed. We ordered a Chinese sausage fried rice and chorizo potatoes, which were ok. Now, you think you've eaten enough, and can't fit anymore down, but you still have dessert coming! You can't skip dessert when it's included in your meal price! I chose what was basically a deconstructed cheese cake, and it was to die for good! My husband chose the cinnamon chips, which were also great (but not as good as the cheesecake). In addition to the bottomless brunch, for $10 more you can have bottomless bloody Mary's or margaritas, which my husband added to his meal (I stick with iced tea). It was a great experience and you should definitely treat yourself sometime to it!",1.0

"I've been to several other teppanyaki experiences before, and I would consider this one to be middle of the pack. The host and chef were both very personable. The chef had great showman skills, but it felt like he didn't spend too much time playing around with us. He tossed vegetables up in the air for those who wanted to catch them with their mouth, and of course, did the sake squirt bottle. If you do not wish to drink sake, they also have a lemonade bottle. Other than the traditional onion choo-choo and the cool egg breaking\/dicing part, that was pretty much the extent of the ""show.""

If you have a birthday they will give you a crazy mask to wear, bang a drum and sing loudly. As other reviews mention, this will happen throughout your visit at most of the other tables too. Osaka will also give the birthday person a complimentary dessert, which is nice of them, but not the tastiest thing you'll ever eat. 

The food: our group had steak and chicken. Both were cooked to order. I liked the steak, but the chicken was bland. They give you sauce to dip it in, but it didn't quite erase the blandness. The fried rice they made at the table was very good though.The cup of soup they bring out was fine, but the salad was not good. (A lot of unattractive iceberg lettuce- tons of white and brown parts - with a few extra veggies thrown in.) 

All in all, it has a festive vibe going on. It might be fun if your group fills a table, and if you have some boisterous people in your group. It's super loud in there, so you won't really be conversing with your table mates much. The food is serviceable. Lastly, the staff that helped us all seemed to be nice and do a good job.",1.0
"I had never had Thai food before and I am pleasantly delighted with Lemongrass.  The dim sum was what we started with, which is like a choice of dumplings (at extremely reasonable prices).  Also ordered the drunken noodles and basil chicken.  They do warn you about the spice level, but it's even spicier than I assumed it would be.  I like spicy food but even at a ""2 out of 10"" spice level I still definitely needed a lot of water.  If you don't like spicy at all you need to order a 1 (They let you choose how spicy.).  Service was kind of weird and very teamwork-oriented and you had to ask for service, but I'm pretty sure that's normal for the kind of restaurant.  I wouldn't know though since it's my first Thai experience.  Overall, I will definitely go back on a future trip to Vegas.",1.0
"I am new to the Scottsdale area and discovered Dr. Wynn's office. I came here today as a new patient for an exam and cleaning. The front desk staff are extremely friendly and thorough. Davina took time to go through my medical history and gave me a tour of the office. The place is very clean, new, high end, and includes state of the art equipment. Dr. Wynn is clearly extremely experienced and took the time to explain everything to me using photographs and videos. Would definitely recommend Trinity Dental Care to anybody looking for a new dentist!",1.0
"If you want true, authentic Japanese food, this should be your first choice in the city. The food is amazing, the atmosphere and decorations are even better. However, it might be a good idea to do some homework before coming as their menu can be a bit confusing. Also if you are a fan of westernized sushi, you will probably not like their sushi.",1.0

"Marthty's review nailed it every way. Ive been here several times being a local and i recommend this pool to everybody. The rest are just pools with good marketing but dont really match up. Great sound system and a typical steve wynn beautifully kept property. Be prepared to pay for it. Muscle men and bros that act like they're 16 again when they drink is what you are going to find at every pool. You will get it here too but not as bad.

"I don't usually write Yelp reviews...but I literally could not stop talking about this place for days after going. I visited Montreal from the US for a short weekend with a friend and was recommended Le Bremner by a bartender at The Coldroom (an awesome speakeasy on St Amable). Figured that we had to try it since our bartender raved about it.

Started with a cocktail that was green, super aromatic, and had hints of cilantro maybe? I can't remember the name of it, but it was so good, I had two. We also started with the Tuna and Tahini which literally melts in your mouth. I don't always love raw tuna, but this was amazing.

For our entrees we shared the Fried Chicken  and the Lamb Neck Cavatelli. Both were great. The Fried Chicken -- super crispy and paired so well with the ranch and side of pickles. The Lamb neck cavatelli was everything I want in a pasta dish -- al dente pasta and a delicious braised meat.

We were hesitant to order dessert because we were so full, but we decided to get the Pancakes w\/ Pimm's butter and sucre a la creme. These were literally the best pancakes I have ever had and they will stay on my mind for probably the next 3 months.

On top of the wonderful food, the music and atmosphere was also great. Would recommend La Bremner to anyone in Montreal in a heartbeat. Hope I'll be back to visit someday. Also, hope that they still have those damn pancakes if I do",1.0

"Had a lovely, relaxing, experience today. Elena did the salt scrub and Roberta did the Ayurvedic pedicure. Going on a Tuesday meant it was quiet and I had most of the facility to myself. Such a treat. I enjoyed the ginger tea and grapefruit juice as well. I'd never gone for a steam before and it was jarring at first. However, it quickly felt as therapeutic as it should, though (due to my personal comfort level \/ heat tolerance) I had to step out a couple of times, which gave me a chance to refill my water cup. I called it quits when the temperature reached 105F but again, that was my choice. I look forward to returning! (The location is very convenient, too.)",1.0

   We enjoyed the Rack of Lamb and Blackened Swordfish, both expertly cooked although the blackened fish had more than its' serving of salt in the seasoning. The twice baked potato was rockin' and we also loved the Brussel sprouts. Don't miss the butter cake which comes warm and a la mode.

"They still have a lot of new restaurant kinks to work out, but they are handling them well. I went with a larger group last week and after our apps came out we were told it would be 30 minutes before we could order so the kitchen could catch up. I really appreciate that honestly instead of having our order taken and sitting there for an hour with no explanation. They weren't super busy, but didn't seem to have a lot of staff on. 

Alex was our server and she was amazing!! She kept her cool even with being busy and dealing with a large table. The hostess was also doing a phenomenal job, although I did not catch her name. 

When we finally got our food, it was so worth the wait. Everything I tried was delicious. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich as a wrap and loved the addition of fried green tomato. The brussel sprouts are addictingly good. I tried my boyfriends 1\/4 chicken and it was perfect and tender. The mashed potatoes were out of this world. I couldn't stop stealing from my boyfriend's plate.

"Who knew this gem (*wink wink*) of a museum was lurking on campus? Well, I did, actually, but I somehow never managed to get myself here until eleven years after I graduated. 

The museum is a decent size for being in a campus building and is set up for a self-guided tour. There's basically one main path that makes a winding loop through the space, and you can access a tour book through their website to enrich your experience. If you can get a group together, the museum offers guided tours for $2 per person that you can set up ahead of time.

The basic setup is you start with minerals and gemstones, wind into a dark area that showcases fluorescent and phosphorescent samples, then you emerge into fossils. There's a somewhat interactive exhibit where you can smell the past (hint: it doesn't smell great), and you can also peer into the fossil lab through a picture window and catch students prepping dino bones during the week. Finally, you exit into the main event, the dinosaur room. 

The Boaz Mastodon is probably the most famous dino skeleton you'll see in the display, found here in Wisconsin in the 1800s. There's also a pterodon, skulls from a T. Rex & triceratops, and few others whose names escape me. 

On your way out in the hallway there's a small display case with items for purchase that help support the free museum. Parking is on the street and can admittedly be a bit of a pain; during the week it's pretty parked up with staff and students, but on a Saturday morning I was able to park without issue in a two-hour zone. The engineering and Union South lots aren't too far away, but those can fill quickly as well during the week. If you can walk, bus, or bike, that's probably the ideal way to get there. 

Depending on how in depth you want to go it could take anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes to explore everything, so it can be both a great way to kill a few minutes on campus or a destination for those who dig dinos, gems, and fossils.",1.0
"So many great things you cant get in most markets.Before noon the donuts and cookies are a home run. The butcher shop is top notch. Its like being in NY city. Only bad thing is the self checkout machines, but, they will help you in  a second . great service.",1.0
"Pros - Right near my work. The customer service there is outstanding and friendly. The food is made very well. The store is clean and never looks cluttered. They are quick to make your sandwich as well. 

Cons - The parking lot is shared with I believe two other agencies over there thus making it difficult to find parking without the fear of being towed.

"Hidden gem for sure! I came here after seeing it featured in a food youtubers video. Got the Chinese burger and cold sesame noodles. Both were excellent but Chinese burger is the clear standout.

"This is SO needed from November through April and then on rainy days during the spring and summer! It's right next to the canal so walk all the way down and you'll find the entrance which reads as ""Pub McCardell"" as the entrance leads to a cafe\/bar next to the outside terasse.

We finally decided to try The Pie Commission for takeout. I called in ahead of time and ordered 4 of their savory pies and 2 of their dessert pies. The total bill came to around $40.  The woman on the phone was very helpful in explaining the pies, her recommendations, and what pies are most popular with customers.  My husband picked the pies up and he threw them in the oven (roughly 40 minutes cook time) later that night.

They were amazing!!

What makes a great pie, for me, is the crust. And I can say that this place has the crust down perfectly! It is lightly flaky, crunchy in some parts, and not overbearing. Just perfect.

If you are a beef eater, I highly recommend the Steak & Cheese.  Next after that, I liked the Beef & Beer. But really, all of the pies that we had would have made a delicious meal on their own.

Also, you get a lot of punch for the price. These pies might look small, but they are mighty!  They are incredibly filling. One is enough for someone who has an average appetite, like myself. Also, I have no problems with their pricing - it was well worth the $ that we paid.

The dessert pies are equally as great.

I loved this food! Hence, my 5-star review. I will be back many times in the future.",1.0
"What a great addition to Tremont! I'll admit, I miss Press Wine Bar, which used to be in this spot & was my go-to for a quick & easy brunch. But Hi & Dry brings so much to the neighborhood - even without brunch - that I can't be mad about it.

They've got a surprisingly tasty menu, though I guess it shouldn't be a surprise, since it's owned by the same folks who ran Press. I love the fried avocado taco & their Philly cheesesteak hoagie. They also have an extensive drink list & a delicious watermelon pineapple sangria. 

I haven't tried their duck pin bowling yet, but I appreciate their large patios & equally spacious indoor space, which gives you plenty of options depending on the weather.

"My wife and I needed 3 separate root systems\/stumps removed from our yard and we of course were looking for a good balance of price and quality, (based on the customer service since pictures are not always available). We received numerous quotes that were astronomical, and of course those companies had terrific customer service. Then we received quotes from companies whose price was great, but after reading their reviews and just simply talking with them on the phone, we didn't feel comfortable with them doing the job. We wanted a company that took pride in their work, had great pricing, and was a pleasure to work with. We were reaching for the stars, we know. 

Mark hit all 3 notes right away. We got a quote that was incredibly competitive, he communicated exactly what he was planning to do, he took measurements and didn't need us to be home at the same time, which was great, because we work during the day, and he was professional, personable and polite on the phone. Invoicing was a breeze. We sent payment via mail, and he was on his way. I can't recommend Mark enough.",1.0

Perkins is not our typical stop... however my boyfriend has been begging me for months for Perkins potato pancakes and tonight I gave in... I'm so happy I did.

"Si vous cherchez un restaurant pour le petit-déjeuner dans le Vieux-Port de Montréal, qui ouvre à 6h30am, tous les jours, Maggie Oakes est bien désigné pour. Il fait parti de l'hôtel William Gray. C'est un beau restaurant de qualité sur la Place Jacques-Cartier contrairement aux autres attrapes touristes dans le coin. Il sert donc des petits déjeuner tôt, ce qui est rare dans ce coin du Vieux-Montréal qui est habituellement désertique mais aussi en après-midi\/soirée sert des grillades\/steaks qui est sa spécialité. Qui dit restaurant d'hôtel dit, prix un peu plus cher qu'ailleurs mais la qualité est là. Ma copine a pris le bénédictine saumon fumé (15$), moi Le Terroir (19$) + 2 américanos (7,50$), plus taxes\/pourboire = 54,22$. Le service de la serveuse était très professionnel avec sourire. La décoration était belle avec son magnifique mur végétal, quoi que la luminosité était un peu sombre. Si vous voulez déjeuner\/brunchez autrement dans un lieu de qualité dans le Vieux-Montréal, je pense que vous allez aimer ce lieu.

"Went here for my wife's birthday. Was very, very nice. Would definitely recommend for a special occasion as it is very pricey, but the service was excellent. We sat upstairs in a room that had three tables, but wish we had sat outside (that's our mistake, not theirs though) Had two drinks, their version of a Manhattan (The Bostic) was terrific, smokey and delicious. Wife had the Local Honey which was very tasty and the server recommended a glass of wine after finding out what type of wine my wife liked. Had the beet carpaccio for an appetizer, which was very good if a bit of a small portion, but it was very fresh and bright. I ordered the elk chop which was EXCELLENT and a must-get if you're there, wife ordered the lobster thermidor which was very good as well. Had the beignets for dessert and yes they wrote Happy Birthday in chocolate. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience, but now that we've been once, we probably will try somewhere else.

I got the Swiss and mushroom smash burger (a sweet potato patty). It came with seasoned fries which were delicious. We sat at the bar and watched football. The bar area of the restaurant is spacious with a casual setting. The bartender was very nice and gave us great service. It is a little pricy depending on what you order, not your bar like prices. But the food was great and different from any other greasy bar food you can get somewhere else. I would definitely recommend it for a chill lunch or dinner and I will definitely go back.",1.0
Amazing food and friendly staff! The wait time was extremely short and the restaurant was spotless. Everyone was smiling when we came in including the guests. Will be going back!,1.0
"I fell in love with this place after eating here once, they serve one of the freshest seafood in Scarborough. I do not think you can find anywhere else that serve such good Asian style seafood, this restaurant is on the pricey side, but you will not regret going to this place.

The atmosphere is like any other Chinese restaurant, but more fancy. When I am in there I feel like I am underwater snorkeling because the whole restaurant is surrounded by water tanks full of Lobsters, King Crab, Dungeness Crabs, and fishes.

The food is really good, and each seafood dish you order taste fantastic because it is all fresh. The portion is huge, a combo for 2-3 people can actually fill 4-5 people. Do your research before going, and I recommend read a lot of the comments on Yelp, to assist you with the menu selection. 

One crazy thing about this place is they have so many menus with combo, and it gets really confusing if they do not explain. If I was to go to this restaurant with my western friends, I would be really clueless because I do not read Chinese. And the names of each dish sound weird, so I would not know what to order. I only came to this place with my family, because they know what is worth it. So tag along with your Asian friends that know Chinese, or have the background knowledge of the menu. Overall, I like it here and I enjoy it every time I visit.

"O. M. G. #Meatloaf. Probably not the first dish that would cross your mind at a place called, ""The Famous Toastery. Don't be fooled, though! It is THE best meatloaf I've ever had in any restaurant!
 The accompanying mashed potatoes are made to order and they put a mildly flavored cheese in their's. It also comes with a roasted vegetable medley that's very complimentary. 
 This place is unique in that the waiter may change but the service is consistent.  It's very warm and casual and there's likely a wait at the usual rush hours, but very well worth it. By 10:00 am on a week day, you should be able to seat yourself, asap.

"Best Korean BBQ I've had in Vegas. The meat is well marinated and juicy. We had the Korean Prime Kalbi and it's awesome. We ordered a la carte as we like to have the Kalbi and with 5 type of meat, we came up cheaper than the package they offer. Mainly due to we don't like to have seaweed salad, dumpling and house salad. That's $10 savings there that can go toward the premium meat. We forgot to check in to get the free ice cream. Still regret till now.",1.0

"The buffet was the first buffet we hit during our spring break. Let's start with the decorations. The decoration was beautiful and  it seemed to have the magic to open up your appetite with colorful fruits and flowers hanging from atop. It was a bright place as they did an excellent job welcoming more lighting into this buffet restaurant. The flowers, fruits, and lighting made the place a happy place to eat. In my opinion, the buffet at Wynn's has the most memorable and the most pleasant design among all of its competitors.
However the quality of food was not quite as five star as the decoration. Some foods were better than others in terms of quality, delicacy, freshness and preparation. The charcuterie section was outstanding which gave out marinated juicy short ribs and pork loins. Seafood was fine but the tuna poke was not the freshest. The Chinese food counter served this large piece of Gai Lan vegetable which could have been cut into smaller pieces to be easily consuming. The salad corner was not positioned well as the plates were sitting right below the salad on the far left side (from diner's view) and created a risk of having diner accidentally drop food to the clean plate. That happened to me. I would recommend to rearrange the location of the plates to avoid this issue. As for the desserts, I tried a bunch of variable ones. They were quite good!  Overall the food was OK. 
Customer service varies based on personnels. The host was cold and should make some efforts to work on her smile. Our server was very nice, attentive and polite; she set up a great example for my kids to learn about manners in general. Cashiers were polite as well. 
I hope to see the buffet continues to make significant improvements in the quality of food and customer service. We'd like to come back again.",1.0

First time using Fast Fix of Scottsdale to replace a watch battery. They were great. The price was higher than other times I have had watch batteries replaced but they give you a five year warranty.

Booked a room very last minute and was very happy to see they had availability. Upgraded to one of the smaller suites that had a great wall of windows to gaze out. 

The room itself was very clean, neatly appointed, and modern. Everything we needed was there. The bathroom was fresh and modern as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the sliding barn-style door that was in place for the bathroom. I don't not like this type of door typically, but when it was closed completely, there was still a small gap, making it feel less private. If the door had been just slightly wider, or the track just a tad longer, the issue would be fixed. Very minor issue, though. 

We ordered room service. The kitchen staff allowed us to order off-menu which will automatically give you an A in my book. The food arrived at our door in record time! Usually room service in other hotels has been slow, sloow, sloooow. Not here! And it was piping hot and delicious!

Our entrees really were amazing. My friend and I split the Carne Asadas and the Al Pastor Taquito. Both meats were cooked to perfection.

Many thanks to Nick and his manager for taking my request today! I am definitely a fan!!!",1.0

"Best ramen in Montreal, no jokes. I had the tonkatsu ramen, with chicken karaage for starters, and green tea ice cream for desert. I would usually have a pint of Sapporo with a bowl of ramen, but they do not sell alcohol (if you go to Ichie Ichigo though, they do sell alcohol, and I believe it is the same ramen, as the two restaurants are connected). 
Chicken karaage was good, but I prefer when the pieces are a bit smaller, it is just easier to eat. I also think  the chicken karaage wasn`t crunchy enough.
Ramen was simply excellent. Broth is amazing, it was not too heavy\/greasy,and gave a comforting feeling, don`t really know how to describe it. The pieces of pork were just so good, fatty, tender, perfect seasoning. 
Then I had the green tea ice cream. Bruh, that **** was heaven in a cup. I think they do it themselves.",1.0
"Ever since they open, I've been eyeballing this place! The inside is so nice y'all! It's very spacious & I like how they stack pizza boxes on the sides so you can just grab a Togo box for your leftover pizza whenever your done(: You would order at the front then they will give you a #, you could take a seat wherever and they'll bring the pizza straight out to ya! We ordered the margarita pizza, the pizzas here are pretty pricy so beware lol! The pizza came out really fast- like REALLY fast. (idk if that's a good or bad thing lol) I love how thin the crust was but the pizza was a bit droopy. Overall I like how it the pizza tasted fresh, like they use quality ingredients but it wasn't the best I've had, honestly I thought it was going to taste aloooot better (like there would be more flavors, it was a little bland) because of all the high reviews. But overall- fresh ingredients + spacious\/clean restaurant + big pizza to share. However I heard their homemade gelato is also really good, so can't wait to come back to try that!",1.0

Seems like a simple thing but amazingly it's not that common to get it just right   Service was attentive,  but not intrusive.  Price is above average for C-U, but I'm totally fine with that... if you get what you pay for.  And I was very impressed with Baxter's.",1.0
"Such a cool, quaint, and hipster looking little popcorn shop.  Its small as heck in there but the smell once you walk in so so delicious. Plus they got boys in cute knee length denim shorts that are making the popcorn in front of you and working the register!

As far as the popcorn?  Of course it was great and fresh!  Who doesn't love chocolate covered popcorn, or Reese peanut butter cup flavored ones, along with your traditional cheese and caramel flavored ones?  Plus, you can sample any flavor that you want!

A little pricey but if you're looking to get your popcorn fix, this is the place for you.",1.0

The store layout was open and clean, and the bathrooms were clean as well.

"You need to pay $5 or more (before tax) in order to have access to the room with cats. There are around 10 cats in the room and they're all fairly friendly. I use the word ""fairly friendly"" because some of them will hiss or scratch. When I went fairly early in the morning, I was decently surprised to find all of them except for one awake and very excited and running all around the place. They're less interested by the toys and more amused by your presence and actions. If you pay some more money or donate some, if you can feed snacks to the cats and that definitely gets all of them to you.

In terms of menu options, they have a wide selection of drinks, but only a handful of them are $5 or more and they have some snacks for purchase as well. The time you get to spend in the cat room honestly seems to depend on the line-up at the point in time. On paper they have a 15-20 minute limit, but when they're no wait (e.g. when we went in the morning), we got to spend about 30-40 minutes in there. It's a cool cafe concept with decent drinks, but I probably won't be back that often.",1.0

"Dr Carla Turner is the BEST gyno doctor in town! She has an excellent bedside manner, superb surgical skills, and truly shows that she cares about her patients. Because she is so good at her profession, she is a very busy doctor.

The apple doesn't fall far from the tree because her front office staff also reflect friendly superb customer service skills each and every visit. Sadly, I am not fond of Dr Miller or any of the others they hire as midwives. I've seen them before because Dr Turner was booked out, but I'm sorry, they just don't compare AT ALL to Dr. Carla Turner! I've even begun scheduling far out, just to ensure I only see Dr Carla Turner. She's worth the wait! And I've now entrusted her to see my daughter too.

"I cannot express my gratitude enough towards the team at Donald Haack. Laura Shannon helped me from the minute I stepped into their beautifully lit store until the minute I walked down the aisle...she even sent me a happy wedding day text the day before the wedding. We brought in my grandmother's diamond ring to have reset for my engagement ring and they handled it with such care and found the perfect setting that worked with my style, profession, and still represented my grandmother's original setting. I went back and forth a million times about the wedding bands and we went in circles over my husband's wedding band, but Laura was very patient, understanding and even had several examples rush shipped into the store so we could see various custom options. Her customer service was beyond ""customer service"". The store is a comfortable setting, as a family owned business should be. And the team bounces ideas off each other and Laura was never hesitant to ask a teammate for recommendations when I asked absurd questions. They made sure what we got was exactly what our hearts wanted. THANK YOU!!",1.0

"Excellent, eclectic, and authentic live music along with a fun crowd, delicious food, and an experience that is both affordable and memorable make this one of my favorite places I visited in Vegas.  In fact, the attention to detail in making a legitimate-seeming Irish restaurant made me somehow forget where I was and I expected to see 3rd Avenue when I walked out the door rather than a Vegas casino floor.

Children dancing ecstatically, old men tapping their feet, and pretty girls twirling away: this place is on part with most real Irish restaurants I've tried.  The only drawback is the food is very heavy and sits like a lead weight in your belly.",1.0

Our meal was really good.  A variety of burgers and fries along with a few beers.  Very, very tasty food.  So food, location and ambiance were a win in my book. 
The only rough part was the service was not the best, this is why I have docked a star.  It wasn't horrible.  Everyone was friendly.  But they could have been more attentive.  I had to ask for water, and it was quite awhile before we got our check.  But otherwise, it was a good experience.  Again, the service is a minor complaint.  But to get 5 stars from me I like the whole experience to be top notch.  Needless to say, we will return.  With our family in tow or perhaps even a date night.",1.0

"My 11 year old daughter decided to join orchestra this year without discussing or researching it first but she was set on playing the Viola.  I looked online and found several places the teacher recommended and while this is for school it would be great to continue throughout her life and I wanted the best options available.  I was thinking of renting due to lower initial cost and because of a growth spurt she may go from a size 14 to a 15 in 6 months or so which made me hesitate buying one for a lower price from craigslist or another site.  

I forgot to look at the store hours and when we got there the back door was open and instruments were being cleaned and they explained they were closed for the day (Sunday) but they were nice enough to help me when I explained I drove from Henderson.  

I believe Brenna helped us first and then Mara started helping us after...THEY WERE BOTH EXTREMELY HELPFUL AND KNOWLEDGEABLE AND PATIENT while we looked at a few instruments and discussed what we were looking for.   We rented and left with a Viola that day and words cannot express how happy my little girl was which also made me very thankful for the awesome customer service we received that day.  I know after years of customer service myself that they went above and beyond to help us which I will be forever grateful for.  Prices were great for students to rent or to buy which we plan on in the future.

"I can't say enough good things about the two guys that were working the morning of Saturday, February 11th. My sister bought me a replacement car battery for my 2010 Volkswagen Beetle as my birthday present (much more useful than socks). Absolutely no problem with the fact that she bought it online in Georgia for me to pick up in Las Vegas. Fantastic pricing, with a discount online as well. If you've never had to install a battery in a Volkswagen Beetle, it is beyond a pain in the you-know-what. These guys never complained ONCE about how difficult it was to do. In fact, the great guy that did the installation even apologized to ME for holding me up, which I certainly didn't mind since I wasn't having to do the installation myself. He was careful, accurate and seemed genuinely concerned about doing the job right. His co-worker was very friendly and courteous and neither of them ever made me feel as if I was a pain or there was something else they'd rather be doing. I'm blown away by the level of customer service I received, and I thought other Yelpers should know this place is great and it's the employees that make it so. And, finding out that the guy who did my installation used to work on planes increased my confidence even more that the job was being done right. Thank you, guys, for getting me back on the road and making it a terrific experience!",1.0
I'm glad I found this place. These guys took great care of my care and didn't try to push unnecessary repairs on me. Which is fantastic considering most places will especially if you're a women.

"My husband and I stopped by yesterday afternoon after reading the yelp reviews.  There is nothing fancy about the inside and it is small, but it has a nice outdoor seating area that we would have taken advantage of except for this time of year it is a bit hot.  The menu is small but the sandwiches have some creative combinations of toppings and both were delicious.  I had the chicken salad which was not your typical chicken salad, it had rotisserie chicken, olives and other toppings on an artisan bread - delicious.  My husband had the crispy chicken sandwich and loved it as well.  We tried the homemade watermelon lime soda, also very creative and refreshing.  

We saw one of the employees walk out with a tray of food and come back a bit later - it wasn't until reading more of the reviews today that we learned you can go to the brewery a few doors down and have them deliver there while you drink your beer.  Next time there is a good possibility we will do that, but I'm glad we got to try the homemade soda regardless.

With regard to the complaints about price from other reviewers, I get it, but if you want something a bit different with quality ingredients and not your run of the mill sandwich it is a great place to go.  If we lived closer we would be back more often.",1.0

"As a Texas boy I was interested in finding a spot that does brisket right, Saucemans did not disappoint. The brisket was very juicy and tender with a distinct smokey flavor. It did not need a sauce but I tried those anyway. I really like their smokey sauce it seems like it is made with just a few ingredients but it is very savory and just a touch of tangy goodness. Prices were reasonable for good BBQ. I got the brisket sandwich, a soda and a side of potato salad. It comes with red or white slaw and some fresh crunchy pickles as well. It was around $12 with everything. My only request that the sandwich have another few slices of brisket. I would of gladly paid $2 or $3 more for a larger portion. The slaw was good crunchy with a good vinegar tang. The potato salad was flavorful with a mustard base and some little bits of crunchy goodness. I will make this one of my regular stops when I visit South End. Delicious.",1.0

"I was on a first date & we had very limited time (like 30 min to order and eat!) in order to make it on time to Wicked! Our waitress was on top of it! We ordered the PV burger and the Chicken Cavatelli. I'm a omnivore but I'll be honest - I'd order the PV burger over the cavtelli next time! The Cavaatelli needed something ... bacon? Pepper? Idk. But it was a little bland... but the PV burger was loaded with flavor! The collard greens (which I've never tried) were also very good! 

I'd definitely go back and try other items on the menu! A solid choice when dining DT CLE!",1.0
"These are the kind of movie theaters that I love! We went there for the first time last week to catch a showing of Spider-Man: Homecoming and it was one of the best movie theater experiences we've ever had. We got there about an hour early because we weren't sure what the crowds would be like, but there weren't any! (I'd recommend at least 30 minutes before your movie so that you can get your choice of seats and get your food order in). Since we were there early, and no one else had arrived yet, it gave us a chance to take our time looking over the menu as it's extensive! Both the food and the drinks! Robert was amazing and let us sample some beers that he thought we would love (and we did, all of them!) and took the time to go over all the menu options and suggest crowd favorites. The food came quickly and it was all so delicious - we got the grilled cheese and the mac n' cheese bites, which we highly recommend. The theater itself was a perfect size, not too many people, and the chairs are quite comfortable. Overall, it was just a really great experience! If there's a movie we want to see and Our Town Cinemas is showing it, it'll be our first choice!

Tips: Bring a sweater as I found it a little chilly. Also, if you plan to enjoy some beer there, the mini pitchers are a great value and you can purchase a second one ahead of time and pick it up during the movie when you're ready for it.",1.0
"Out of body amazing. Worth the wait for a reservation! This is supreme Japanese food. Enter through the small secret door without a sign and enjoy what the chef offers.

"These ladies are the real deal! I first stopped in with a massive migraine and in major pain. It was later in the day and I didn't expect anyone to be able to see me that day. I thought I was done for and would have to suck it up for the night in pain. But Jenny picked up and gave me a wonderful massage, cleared up my crazy headache, and helped my pain flare-up - I had the best sleep that night!

Quick backstory on me - I have had chronic pain since I was a little girl. Over years of being misdiagnosed as a million things, I finally was properly diagnosed with Lyme Disease about 6 years ago. I have dealt with chronic pain that no treatment rarely EVER helps. Lyme Treatment helped with many of my symptoms, but pain is still a huge problem for me. Chiropractic and massage are the only things that have relatively helped me in my pain. 

Since I found Jenny, Cassandra and her team, my pain has been helped immensely. Each member of the Odyssey team has their own strengths and specialties. With my chronic pain issues, they all teamed up and paired me with each of the therapists to see if we could find what really helped my pain and what clicked. From ashiatsu to cranial-sacral, this team is superb! AMAZING customer service and the loveliest of people. Do yourself a favor and GO HERE!",1.0

"Two months ago, I went to an eye doctor at a different store for an eye exam and contact lenses, and that doctor gave me a prescription that was slightly blurry. As a result, I made an appointment with Visionworks to see doctor Todd Shuba. He had done my eye exams for the previous few years, and I had good results. This time, he spent time making sure that my new prescription gave me clear vision. I feel very thankful that I now have contact lenses that are comfortable and help me to see.",1.0

Not too greasy burger in a well toasted bun that really comes together in a wonderful way. The fries are seasoned and tasty as well. Over all the food here is as good as everyone says it is. 

The atmosphere is classic bar vibe with a pool table in back. It's not upscale or trying to hard. This place knows what it is and does it's job well. I heartily endorse Harvey's Wine Burger. Go here. You won't regret it.",1.0
When you walk in to the clinic it's large and tidy. There are multiple activity play areas so the kids. The nurses are all very nice and great with kids.

We have stayed at the Aria every Thanksgiving week since it opened. This is our 35th straight annual Thanksgiving in Vegas so we have seen HUGE changes in the culinary offerings in Sin City over the years. During the six nights we are staying here at least three we will dine at Lemongrass. Is it pricey? Yep but not crazy for Las Vegas Strip restaurants. The quality and selection of dishes offered here is GREAT! Have yet to find one bad dish. I change what I order each time and always leave full and happy. Service has always been good and we will definitely be back and back again...,1.0
"Awesome place to eat and kill some time. Great atmosphere and lots of TV's showing different types of sports. Wings are probably the best that I've had in the valley. Mozzarella sticks are also really good, just not tour normal mozzarella sticks. They're not breaded but wrapped in rice paper I believe. Almost like egg roll style. Still really good though!",1.0

"After wrapping up an event at the CNE, we decided to head there for a quick bite before driving\/parking on the Gardiner\/404 to our trek home. The tacos were on special - $2.50 each. Based on the price, i wasn't expecting much, but what a surprise. Fresh, great taste and perfect amount of meat,cabbage, sauce, topping. The nachos came next which were OK. Not bad but nothing to rave about either. I guess the tacos set the standard high. 
Service is amazing. From the moment you walk in to the time you leave. And the place is comforting. Great to come and hang out with friends. Will come back for sure to try other items.",1.0

The toast was also SO good. We tried the avocado toast & the braised peppers\/onions\/egg toast and were really pleasantly surprised. The braised vegetable mixture was really good if you like a hearty substance on your toast. The avocado toast - omg. Every time I get avocado toast, I think to myself ""Ugh why am I getting this I could make it at home."" Well, NOT the case. This avocado toast was just so yum!!! The toast (S\/O to Noble for awesome toast) was so buttery and crunchy on the outside and soft ish in the middle. The egg was perfectly hard boiled, and the avocado was creamy and very lemony with bits of coarse sea salt. Definitely makes me rethink my avo toast thoughts. I'd definitely try this again!

This place is quite a fresh take on an older side of Glendale. The service was friendly and the coffee tasted great!

"Was our second trip here. Last one was 3 years ago and since that time the place has changed hands. We were weary about trying it under the new owners but we worried for no reason because it was better than the last time. This place is gluten free, so the batter on the seafood is mostly cornmeal. It's not quite like what you're used to however it's still good. I had the captains platter which allows you to select 3 items, I had the fish (2 pieces of cod) scallops (5) and whole belly fried clams (5). All were cooked to perfection. My wife had the fish and chips, 2 pieces, (1 each cod and haddock) of fish and upgraded to the Greek fries, which ate fries with feta and spices. Fish was cooked great, white and flaky. Service was quick and efficient.  Prices are very reasonable about 20 for platter and 15 for fish and chips. We'll be back way sooner than 3 years!",1.0

My sushi order NEVER came out. After we had eaten all our appetizers and put in a second AYCE order... we realized something was up because everyone around us was eating. When we ask where our food was the server accused us of getting our food and said we didnt order those things and... it was just bogus to say the least.

I highly recommend this place for windshield repair.",1.0
"Great Ramen don't come around typical dinner times because there's more than likely going to be a line up here, not because they have the best Ramen in town but due to inadequate seating.

"Grand opening day is understandably chaotic. However, there were some definite hits and misses.

First up, the hits:

The brisket is melt in your mouth, fork tender. No knife needed for this treat.  Great flavor that doesn't need sauce to detract from it!

The chicken is equally tender and flavorful. Definitely worth trying. 

The ribs are fabulous. Again, melt in your mouth tender. 

The cornbread would be a awesome compliment to a brisket chili when the weather cools off a bit more (hint! Hint!)

The banana pudding is a-ma-zing!  Tastes homemade and perfectly sweetened by the fresh bananas and caramel. 

Now for the misses...

The door to the patio is awkwardly placed.  On a busy day who wants to squeeze back and forth through the line to get drink refills, condiments, etc.  This could have been better thought out.

The texas toast was just okay.  Toasted bread, no real flavor.  Moving on...

The mac 'n cheese.   What can I say, I'm biased when it comes to mac 'n cheese.  The mac 'n cheese at Mac's Speed Shop is the gold standard by which all other mac 'n cheese is judged.  Sadly City Barbecue's version is nothing to write home about.  It's pasta and cheese sauce but that's about it.


Overall, we enjoyed our visit to City Barbecue and will probably come back. Next time we will try some other menu items like the sausage, turkey and some of the other side options.  The banana pudding will definitely be part if that visit, too.",1.0
Omg! Just walking in here is like a spa treatment. The scent of all the florals and herbs in the handmade soaps and beauty products just knocks all the stress out of your body. Store is soooo cute and original! Its like my dream bedroom. Original art and handmade lotions and jewelry line the walls. I spent a long time looking at all the different products. I ended up purchasing the sea breeze soap and facial lotion for about $30. Which is actually similar or cheaper for what youd spend at lush. The soap is amazing! I keep it in my shower but it perfumes my whole bathroom with its oceanside and peppermint scent. Love it. The lotion is very moisturizing and great for my sensitive skin. usually I have to use two or three layers of lotion on my face to keep it moisturized but one layer of this lotion and my skin is dewy and fresh for the whole day and not oily. I only wish they had as much variety with their other beauty products as they do with their soaps. Will be back and i hope this place does well because they have an amazing product with lots of love put into it and the store!,1.0

"My girl a freak so she like chocolate drizzled on her ass and me to lick it off. I go to Malley's to get the chocolate. It's the best on her skin. We tried all kinds of chocolate.

Malley's chocolate leaves her skin smooth and smellin like confectionary sex. My girl treat me like the king I am. We met five years ago at the IX indoor amusement park. Something in her eyes made me know that if I bought her a ride on the ferris wheel she'd be mine but it turned out I was wrong. She freaked my lil cousin Danny first. They were freakin each other for weeks like some bunny rabbits. I couldn't get my mind off her ass tho. I was layin in bed in my cold room wastin the life outta myself for want of her gold sex. If you seen my girl's ass you'd have the same problem. God has not created a more perfect curvature in all the world. My girl's ass is what makes the sun come up. It's the reason why the flowers bloom. Why wars are fought and times of peace are sought. It's truly one of the most beautiful things to behold. It's the Helen of Troy of Cleveland asses. So one night I cut my cousin Danny and I confessed my love for her. Soon after that we was freakin like some bunny rabbits. No more Danny. We like to hang out in the park at night with some Heineken and some blunts and have ourselves a good ol time.

"We found Drfit from Yelp and decided to check it out after a movie. The great reviews don't even do justice to how awesome this place is. Ali, the owner, is not only incredibly welcoming but he is very friendly as well. The shisha was great. Ali has a ton of flavors to choose from including some rarer finds. He uses Coco Nara coals and KM pipes. The pipes were clean and the water was fresh. Each shisha flavor has its on hose so you don't worry about mixing flavors.

"Stumbled upon this gem while visiting Pittsburgh over the holidays and ended up sticking around for a full 5 hours (we blamed the snow, but it was mostly due to not wanting to leave).  Here's why: 
- friendly, down to earth service
- the best burger I've ever had, hands down (whoa!) 
- great happy hour prices (and sizes of plates!) 
- cozy, polished atmosphere without feeling pretentious 
- a touchtunes jukebox (okay, sometimes this can be a bad thing, but my friends and I greatly appreciated it)

"Whenever I want comfort or recovery food- this is my go to! I love their vegetarian ramen bowls; the pumpkin ramen is amazingly flavourful!! Their mushroom buns are fantastic! They have a nice rich sauce and honestly, I think they're better than either the BBQ pork buns or plain pork buns. Truly! 

 Their gluten free options are lacking, especially if you come with kids and are looking for non-spicy items. The cauliflower is nicely seasoned. Would recommend as a second share appetizer.

"After six months of unsuccessfully trying for a baby my OB-GYN recommended acupuncture with Dr Koegedal.

"For the food and atmosphere this place is special. Shout out to Cali and the L.A. hip hop\/ rap scene. While hits from Ice Cube and Tupac are playing, you get to try to figure out what you want to pick out with their large digital menu. Getting the Dirty Chili Dog to go today. The lines do get long and parking can be tricky. The restaurant is tucked in the way back corner of a strip mall where a pet hospital and a big bar\/lounge is, so I recommend just parking a little farther and just walking the rest of the way. Customer service is really nice and the murals of Tupac and Kobe Bryant adds to the atmosphere. They offer style tacos and a vegan taco too. The corn on the cob is Mexican street style with chili powder, slice of lime, and cotija cheese on top. Yum yum. They also serve some craft beers, horchata, and Jamaica drink. However, sometime they run out of things. Maybe because they are so busy? Like today they said they ran out if CO2 for their soda machine. Boo. And they ran out of horchata today. Either way, the place is still cool and the food is good. I'm sure they will work out some of these supply issues as they see how more popular they are getting. Come and get your Tupac and hot dog fix here!",1.0
"It was my second time here. I wanted to have dim sum for New Year so here we came! 

There was a waiting line when we got there. However, it didn't take too long. The waiter handed the line very well. I was glad that I decided to come here on New Year day. 

We were seated in front of the cash register. It was like in the middle of the dinning room. The restaurant is bigger than its look. They have another dinning room which can accommodate for big parties at the back. They also use PLASTIC tablecloth for dinning tables which makes it easy for them to clean and set up tables in a few second. Is it good? Umm.. I'm fine with it though as long as tables are not dirty. 

DIM SUM is served ALL DAY which is perfect. They open until 2 am. So, it's good for night owls right? 

We ordered Shiu Mai, Har Gaw, Deep fried squid tentacle, deep fried chicken wings, Steamed BBQ pork buns, Sesame paste balls, Pork meat & shrimp dumpling in Chiu Chow style and crab meat with fish maw soup. The best part was Shiu Mai!  They were so big and yummy!  Now I knew why every table ordered it. The rest of our order were delicious too.  Only Har Gar and Fish Maw soup were just OK. 

How was the service? I didn't expect to talk to our waitress much because she didn't seem like to speak english. It was good enough for me (again) as long as she got our order correctly. It's Chinese restaurant and I always understand that.  

Definitely come back again DIM SUM DIM SUM ;)",1.0
"Modern ""Speakeasy"" in appearance, but not in experience.  Lots of wood and leather decor, soft amber lighting, a great beer, wine and liquor selection, bearded mixologists that make smooth and satisfying cocktails - I recommend the Hotel Nacional (rum, pineapple) and the Busty Loo (vodka, grapefruit) - and an attractive, diverse crowd in an upscale setting.  Yet, a bit more ""clubby"" than most other speakeasy-style bars I've been to, as on the Friday I went the DJ was spinning modern and classic R&B and pop with added drumbeats that was altogether quite intrusive. Most of these speakeasy-style bars I've been to conduct business in more hushed tones and subjugate the music to the background to enable conversation; Maybe that's just my personal preference.  I look forward to going back sometime in the not-too-distant future, it's just not the place on the weekends to have long conversations with your companion(s).",1.0
"We had high hopes for this sushi restaurant because it's walking distance from our apartment. We were not let down! The fish was so fresh and clean tasting!

The miso ramen was also incredibly flavorful and hearty. Everything was A+. Will return again...and again...and again.",1.0

Their Hokkaido milk tea and Taro smoothie with fresh taro on top is to DIE for. The ingredients they are so fresh it like they pick it from a garden.

I called 3 different places so I could get 3 different quotes.  Chris called and came out to give me an estimate before the other two even got back to me.  Very reasonable priced, his work crew were very professional, did an amazing job, cleaned up well after themselves, and were great to work with. I recommended them to my sister-in-law and she used them to paint part of the interior of her home and they did a great job there as well.

"The other night, we wanted to try something different for dinner. I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and my fiancé was excited to try it. Here is what you need to know about me: my family is Czech and I've been all over Europe, including Germany so I had high expectations. 

We got there and were told the wait would be 35 minutes. It ended up being an hour. Not the end of the world but I wish we had been given a more accurate estimate. We each got a beer and liked them. We started with the potato pancakes and they were aaaaaaaamazing! So flavorful and delicious. For our meals, my fiancé got the Schweizer Schnitzel with Spätzle and mashed potatoes. He loved his meal and had no complaints. I got the sampler with Spätzle and bread dumplings. I loved the schnitzel and the brat but the steak was soooooooooooooo (insert a million ""o""s here) dry. I pretty much left the entire thing on my plate and my fiancé didn't even eat it (which says a lot because he loves meat). For dessert we shared the apfelstrudel and it was divine.

"My husband and I love this place so much that we had our rehearsal dinner here.  They are sooooo nice and accommodating - they did not bat an eyelash when we called to make a reservation for 20 people, and they let us bring our own birthday dessert for one of our party.  They set up a nice long table for us and even went around taking our orders (normally it's counter service).  The staff is always the sweetest.  The food is always the bombest.  My favorites are the lengua and carne asada tacos, but my parents love their burritos (all of them, which is saying a lot for a traditional first-gen Chinese couple) and their quesadillas are spot on.  Taco Sahuaro has ruined me for all other taco places.  How do they make their tortillas so delicious????",1.0

Top it with the house made lemon basil vinaigrette and add the organic quinoa burger patty, and it's just perfection. I stayed in Vegas at the Aria for two days, and I ate here two times because it was that good and conveniently right inside the hotel. When I was there, it took a little longer than expected to prepare, but this is no typical salad. It's well worth the wait!",1.0

"I wanted to update this review since I've been going to SweatSquared for the past three months. I'm overweight and I've tried diets and will continue to monitor my weight; however, I knew I needed to gain muscle and flexibility. I wasn't prepared for Sweat Squared. From day 1 it kicked my butt at the regular classes, but in 45 minutes, it was hard, but I felt great. It was also great for my joints since it didn't impact them, but loved the stretch, strengthening and flexibility. The amazing thing is that there were real results, right away. I am not making this up. I have abs cut in. Yes, I still have fat, but there is true definition. My friend Brandie saw it and she joined as well. 

Some people have said that other studios offer one hour classes and that's true, but it's not about how long a class is. In 45 minutes, it gets my cardio up, I sweat, I push myself, and it's work. I can't take more than 45 minutes. BUT as most trainers have said, it's the intensity of the workout in short spurts that make the biggest difference. It's been true for me. 

I only write reviews when I am really compelled something is great, unless it is food (because I review food for restaurants I go regardless).

I have come to love this little studio. Each instructor is different here, and that is great if you go to several classes in a week because it works differently on the same part of your body in a slightly different way so that just about every single muscle in your body. I like the different styles and characters each instructor brings. They also have visiting instructors from California who are known in the industry to add variety. For a small studio, this is an amazing place. Did I mention that during the summer there are NBA players who come to work out at this studio with their trainers?

I love giving great reviews for places that I love, but there is a downside, the gym gets busy. BUT, this place deserves it. I want them to continue to be successful. 

For those new to Pilates, try out the Stretch and Sweat classes. It's less intense and more stretch. I usually like to go to a regular class and then to a stretch and sweat class the next day to still get some of a workout but to really get the additional stretch and flexibility. I'm middle-aged, so it helps all around. But, I think for beginners who are just getting into it, it's a great class to start. I did start with the regular classes, but I need a few weeks to be able to keep up, but I'm glad I did. 

Finally, the intro option is amazing price wise. There is a special for about $10 a class for 10 sessions. If you try it you'll get hooked. Afterwards they have several packages for numbers of lessons or monthly fees. There is no membership.

The staff and owner are super friendly and they are really interested in helping their members. People loved stretch and sweat, so, they agreed to add more of them as well. 

If you haven't tried, and you're thinking about it, this is definitely a great place.",1.0

The best thing that I learned recently is that they do newborn\/infant adjustments as well, which to me is unique and requires a lot of care, attention and specialized training.

"Great soup. They have their every day selections of soup but have specials each day. I have honestly have only tried the Parikash, Clam Chowder​ and Jambalaya cuz they are SO good.

"Cute little bakery shop nestled in amongst suburbia. Odd to get to as it's a one way half moon street, but you can park along it. Great place to go if you live in area or pick up, but way hidden to main traffic. There's a park and benches in middle of half moon drive. 

Clean and pretty cafe, 4-6 tables, good choices of sandwiches to desserts. What sets them apart here is their Natas(Portuguese tarts) are really Really good! It's like a heavier version of creme brûlée set in a flaky pastry shell, flamed on top but no sugar crust. Had ordered 12 but then wanted more but they had sold out right after that, they had pre orders of 40 and 100 in that same day.
The owner was nice enough to explain they are quick to make but needs over an hour to cool down, otherwise it's hot molten lava and they will not let you leave the store with that dangerous goodness sloshing around. So be warned if you need these one day- PREORDER!

The menu is reasonably priced for small-plates, and the waitstaff is both attentive and knowledgeable about their food and drinks. I especially love the dessert sampler, which comes with approximately 5-6 desserts for tasting (the Lemon-Berry tarte is my favorite!). In addition, the Firefly fries are delicious, I love the ceviche of shrimp, mushroom tart, and the Manchego mac'n' cheese is to die for! The fried calamari is also a win here.

"I went there last night, and I can say it was amazing. When you walk in, the smoky barbecue smell just hits you. The service was incredible, as they were incredibly accommodating to the vegetarian in my large party. The food was wonderful, in particular, we enjoyed the cornbread muffins served at the beginning and all the different kinds of barbecue. Between my party, we ordered; pulled chicken, pulled pork, sausages, brisket, and the baby back ribs. All of them get high marks! Overall this is a great comfortable place to enjoy some music and great food.",1.0
When my best friend and I came in we immediately felt really comfortable. We were greeted right away. I was helping my friend buy her first vape pen and couldn't have done it without Morgan!

"This is one of those places you hate to tell anyone about and want to keep all to yourself. That wouldn't be very nice though would it. I can't find a single fault with their pizza. The sauce is perfect with just a hint of sweet the dough is like really good New York (they have a Chicago deep dish style to, looks fabulous but I haven't tried it.) They use good quality cheese and toppings and aren't skimpy with it.
Just as a bonus a nice beer garden, full bar, live music on the weekends and an incredibly friendly staff. This is all hidden away in a strip center that you almost have to search out.. So search it out. The large pizza is huge, it's a guaranty of pizza the next day if 2 people order it. Try the pizza cookie for dessert.. Big warm fresh out of the oven cookie topped with ice cream.. What's not to like about that.",1.0

Picked up some bagelah (sp?), which are like little bagel\/blintz clouds, for my mom. She loved them and they're exactly the same as from her childhood days as a lil' Montrealer.

"Tried a new place today called Anaya's Fresh Mexican Restaurant. Walking in you have no idea what to expect, but once the door is open you are pleasantly surprised. It's a quaint little eatery with bright colors and a very nice staff. We ordered the Mexican Flag Burrito, the Pollo Fundito and the kids Grilled Cheese. My sexy hubby loved his giant colored red, white and green burrito. It was stuffed with chicken, beans, rice and hearty helping of love. Our son didn't like his grilled cheese too much, super dry and he found an onion hiding in it. 
I really liked the Pollo Fundito. It tasted great and made my tummy smile when I was eating it. It truly was fundito to eato! Tap, tap, tap, is this thing on? Hello...

"Dropped by Gushi at the Queen street market for their $5 anniversary special.

Compared to the one on dundas, this one's indoors, which is a plus because I would much rather have a nice meal inside an air-conditioned building than standing out in the elements.

They accept credit card, so they punched in the number on the machine and handed it to me, then went back to the kitchen to prepare food. I stood there for a few seconds looking at the machine thinking it would automatically progress to the next screen as there were no on-screen instructions, but eventually I decided to try pressing OK and it moved on. They offer tip for 15%, 20%, and 25%, and then manual input. So if you're looking to not tip, you'll have to work for it.

I ordered the regular original chicken meal, and it was filled quite slowly. There was someone else ahead of me, that got impatient and had asked whether his meal will be ready soon. It took about 10 minutes before the box came out! Mostly waiting for the chicken. Well, it's a nice AC'd building with workbenches in the middle so you have something to lean against while you're staring at your phone or talking to a buddy who's also waiting for food.

It was definitely worth the wait though. All the pieces were nice and hot. The batter was very thin and slightly crisped. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The purple rice goes well with the chicken, and the pickles were alright.

While the meal itself was somewhat filling, I did pay half-price for it. At regular price, it's not that much chicken! Only 3 pieces, not particularly large either. It looks like the amount of chicken has also gone down from before based on reviews. Regular price you're looking at $9 for a regular, and $4.50 to upgrade to a large (which comes with another 2 pieces).

Their 5-year anniversary special meals also come with less meat.
Is it because you're paying less than half-price? For example, the everything box only came with one of each item. If one were to expect to get a ""regular"" item during the special, they might leave with a poor impression.",1.0

"Passed by this restaurant many times & finally got to try this place for a weekday lunch.  Was there from 12:30pm to 2:30pm. As I had made an online reservation, my guest & I were offered a window seat.  The restaurant is quite big, however the tables in the area where we sat were set-up quite close to each other.  Luckily Ricarda's wasn't very busy that day, otherwise it may have felt somewhat cramped up.

"This review is specifically for one of their servers, Jayme. My friend and I were in town Saturday night from Chicago for the Brat fest, and we decided to stop here before heading back home. From the onset you can tell he is very courteous and attentive, as any server should be. At first glance it appears as though he's the only one working the entire restaurant because he's so busy attending to everyone's needs, including at the host desk. However, Jayme was having a difficult night due to unruly and disrespectful customers who were demanding his time unnecessarily. My friend and I observed him treating everyone with the same level of kindness, respect, and attention - certain tables were the problem, not him. To the management - please give him a round of applause cause he's amazing and clearly a harder worker than the other servers (that evening). To Jayme - you're so great, don't let a handful of idiots stop you from being a good person!!",1.0

Back to my context - I had a lot of work done: crowns, fillings, deep cleaning, bridge.

All completed in less than 60 days.  I was adamant about getting the procedures completed because I commute to SF for work every so often. 

They even took care of my partner. She had 4-5 filings that required immediate attention. 

Personality-wise Dr.Holland was friendly and receptive to my request. He was the perfect balance of cool, calm and collected.

Did I say he is the most meticulous dentist I've ever been to.  I've been to over 20+ dentist in my lifetime and I only choose the best from Yelp. 

I had to give Dr.Holland a try regardless of what folks say here because my partners parents gave me a referral I could not refuse.  From traditional word of mouth, they said ""Dr.Holland will not rip you off. He will only work on necessities and he is very honest.""

My friend had the beef fajitas and she loved it. The drinks in my opinion are bit pricey...yes $ 8.50 for a frozen raspberry margarita isn't exactly cheap and they are not generous with the serving of the glass size either...so before tip our bill was $ 47.99 - that's a lot of money to spend on two people for lunch.

"I love this place.. That's all I can say.. My family and I have been coming here for years. DO NOT ASK FOR KETCHUP because they don't have it, the Petes sauce is all you need! I always get two burritos and a regular fry. The service does need work but I'm there for the food so I tend to ignore they're bland attitudes. I'm glad to see a local business grow, love the new expansion. I will always recommend and go back.",1.0
"Roman Candle has not let me down yet. As a lactose-intolerant pescatarian, i always struggle to find a pizza place that makes a good cheese-less pizza. Trust me, it's a skill that not many pizza parlors have\/care to cultivate. 

Not only does Roman Candle have a cheese-less pizza, they actually advertise it as one of their specialty pizzas! The Vegan Destroyer literally destroyed my hunger, haha. It comes with red pepper puree (if you're looking to eat outside the traditional tomato sauce box), and incredibly fresh toppings. Now I don't have to cry inside when my company orders pizza for lunch! :D",1.0
"I went here on the 28th to celebrate the Chinese New Year with all of my family and couple friends.  This place fills up quickly soon after they open and we were one of the first people to arrive for the day and I'm glad that we arrived so early.  The food was excellent and service was fair.  

I'm a West Valley lady and this was quite the drive for me but well worth it.  There's a boba shop next door to satisfy your sweet tooth after your meal and an Asian supermarket and little shops in between to walk off the calories you've just consumed.  I would definitely come back as time allows.",1.0

"One of the places I went to during this break is Nadège, which opened up relatively recently in Yorkdale Mall! They've always had a few locations downtown. Yorkdale Mall upgraded themselves with stores like Canada Goose, Muji, Uniqlo and Nadège was part of the expansion. I believe the Nadège in Yorkdale is their biggest location - but don't quote me on that.

Besides their widely known macarons, Nadège also sell cakes, tarts, quiches, chocolate, sandwiches and even offer drinks there! But you know me... My eyes hover towards the macaron section~

I got a box of 6 macarons, which was $15. They had a huge selection of macarons which made it hard just to choose 6 flavours! They had almost 20 flavours of macaron available!! Macaron heaven for me~

Chocolate Fleur de Sel, Salted Caramel, Santa macaron which was a seasonal macaron, consisting of hazelnut and praline; Champagne, Cappuccino and Vanilla.

I was excited for the Champagne macaron because it was a completely new flavour and it has a slight shimmer to it, which I thought was super fitting for champagne flavour. The taste, however, wasn't up to par as the looks, it would be on the low end of my box of 6.

Next up is Chocolate Fleur de Sel which was so good! It was definitely a safe choice for me since I like chocolate, but I thought the design of it was cute as well. Nadège had both Chocolate and Chocolate Fleur de Sel flavours, since I don't know the difference between either flavours, I just chose the one with the cuter design. Chocolate was just plain brown in appearance compared to the speckled brown of the Chocolate Fleur de Sel.

The Santa macaron was one out of the three seasonal macarons they offered! I only remember the other one being a Reindeer macaron... I didn't like the other two flavours of the macarons even though they were cute and festive. The Santa macaron was a mixture of hazelnut and praline, which tasted more hazelnut, less praline... But I enjoyed it! Plus, how can you resist how cute and festive this design of the macaron is? 

Out of all the flavours, I enjoyed the Cappuccino, Santa and Chocolate Fleur de Sel macaron the most.

The service was lovely, and the girl even provided us samples to try while I was looking for the flavours to choose. The samples, however, was as hard as a freaking rock - definitely not enjoyable at all. But we all know why it was a sample....

Other than that, I would definitely come back to try more flavours. I love the design and layout of Nadège in Yorkdale Mall! Pure white, and full of fun colourful sweets to brighten up the store. They even have several seats for people who want to dine in at that time.

Do note that while paying, tax\/tip isn't included in the price. So a box of $15, was $15 flat - I guess they already added tax with the price, which was nice! :)",1.0
We always have great service no matter when we go. Never ordered food that wasn't delicious! And lots of tvs to catch our favorite sports.,1.0
"Not too shabby! This place is pretty good for a quick, healthy bite to eat. I've tried most of the menu items now and I'd have to say the best are the Kale Caesar and the Energy Parfaits.. oh, and the soup is always really tasty too! The Kale Caesar dressing is quite possibly the best I've had and I love that they threw some chickpeas, avocado, tempeh and grape tomatoes in there to keep things interesting. The coconut whipped cream on the parfaits is super thick and creamy. My only 'beef' with this place is that it's pretty expensive. Also, there's nowhere to sit and eat. There are a couple of high top tables that you can stand at while you chow down but a few bar stools would really go a long way. But hey, thanks for making high quality healthy grub easily accessible!",1.0

"My husband had given up hope that we would ever make it to Woodstock, because I don't eat most meat...and this place has a florescent sign in the window that says, ""LET THERE BE MEAT."" I saw on their Facebook page that they had a perch special for lent, so we ventured there last Friday. I had the perch, and my husband had the pulled pork. The fish was breaded perfectly. Cole slaw was great, and the cornbread was probably the best I've ever had. Their BBQ sauce (I think there was a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce on the table) had me thinking we were somewhere down south..only for thing missing was the sweet tea and warmer weather! I'm hoping they keep some kind of seafood option on the menu, or we won't really be able to go back...I really hope they do, because I would love to go back for more! Service was great, and not a bad wait for a Friday.

Had to lower to 4 stars..not happy about it, but recently went back a second time. Food was great, but waited 45 minutes to an hour for a table, and another hour to get our food.",1.0

Everybody had cocktails. The service was fabulous! I like to come here for football games as well and sit at the bar. I've also had wonderful service at the bar too whether it's been busy or not. A few drinks and a Oh My Spaghetti Pie slice during the game! :) I'd recommend this establishment for za and apps. I would like to try a burger if I wasn't such a creature of habit...",1.0
"Good place for pho if you're in the vicinity. Their large bowl of noodles woild be considered medium in Westminster, California. However, their broth was good, brisket and rare beef were tender, and noodles were not over cooked. The basil that came with my pho was a little beat up \/ wilted. This place was clean, service was good, and I would definitely come back if I were in the area.",1.0

Thank you again Charlie for the great experience!",1.0
Good service and food is good but such a small portion for the 2 of us. Can't compare to the LA honey pig. It seems like the combo for 2 is the half of the size of the combo in LA. More meat please! Otherwise yum.,1.0

"So impressed with the way this shop is run by Andrew D. 
Andrew possesses the experience and expertise to handle my older BMW , but unlike other shops, he also has the finesse when it comes to customer service. That is just as important. He not only fixed my problem, but I also received a perfect written estimate, and detailed invoice of work done.  I got diagnostic info, and recommended repair suggestions for the distant future. This experience was better than I could have imagined, and I completely trust Ultimate Auto Repair Service for anything I could possibly need.",1.0

"Jeremy and his highly compete crew did an outstanding job on our solid granite 3\/4 inch thick counter tops.  We did a renovation and changed out the stove top and the sink.  The new stove top required enlarging the existing cut out in our granite counter.  His crew built a plastic 'tent' to minimize the fine dust from cutting the granite.  Then they expertly cut the opening to the proper size for the new stove top, which now fits perfectly.

The sink was (in my opinion) a more difficult job.  It required enlarging the existing opening, but also including small radius corners.  Once finished, they polished the freshly cut edge, so the opening for the under-mount sink looks as beautiful as the original finish on our granite.

I found Jeremy and his crew very easy to work with.  Would absolutely use them again.",1.0
If you're reading this and you're in Scottsdale go ahead and go now. Great environment as well as good food. Now let me tell you about this cinnamon roll. It's as big as my head and it's good as hell. I've also had 2 of the burgers which are good as well. TVs all over so you can watch sporting events. If you are big on mimosas they have bottomless mimosas weekends from 11-3.,1.0
"I finally decided to stop by at WTF Expo, and I want to say I'm very impress. I work down the street and I would always come across pamphlets on people's desk from this place. After getting fed up with restaurant options near by I decided to give it a try. I must admit I was consumed by all the options it offers, but I'm very happy with what I ordered it was delicious!!! I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, Mom's Way, and it was tasty, warm and just right! I also ordered the mango habanero wings which were good not hot at all (for my taste).The wings were enjoyable because I didn't have a runny nose while biting into them. Overall 5 stars is well deserved! I will definitely stop by durning my lunches more often!",1.0

"Does anyone dislike Cora's? Is that even possible? Though it is a chain, I find all Cora's that I have been to be very consistent. My favourite thing to get is Buckwheat Blessing, but I always order the cheese that comes with it to be put on the side - the portions are super generous! I especially enjoy the presentation of the fruits and I find having it quite enjoyable. Not all dishes have such a fruit accompaniment, so choose wisely!

I would have given Cora's 5 stars, but I do find that the chain could benefit from using better coffee. I find the house coffee to be on the disappointing side.

Overall, Cora's is a place I would visit and visit again",1.0

Free wifi.  And to top it all off, they have a 24 hour bar! My only critique is the seating can be kind of tight when they are busy, but I don't feel like it's worth docking them a star. I'm an Urban Bean boy, through and through. You should be too. Or a girl, they are also cool. Am I rhyming, wow I sound like a fool.",1.0

"By far the best bakery in Pittsburgh, Gaby et Jules makes excellent macarons. I always stop in if I am in Squirrel Hill or I drop by the counter in Market Square. Earl Grey, White Chocolate Basil, and that one with apricot are my go-to favorites, but you really can't go wrong no matter what you choose. I also recommend the canele, which is caramelized on the outside and custardy on the inside. To top it all off, the quality is great, but I've never had more than one or two people ahead of me in line and the prices are very reasonable compared to macarons I've had in the $3-4 range. It's nice to have a great French bakery and not have to wait in lines - the perks of being in a smaller city!",1.0

I bought my first road bike here a few months ago - on the advice from a much more expensive shop just up the street.

The Goat and beets appetizer is simply exquisite. For the first time ever I'm interested in a recipe. It's nutty & sweet. The only bad thing is the quantity. They should charge more, but make it bigger for sure. The clam chowder is high up there as well. Very homey. Lots of veggies. I want to be back for the pork tacos. Or for the beets salad again.. Ok, for both then.",1.0
"Came here on a Friday night and it was super packed. Had to wait a little bit for seats and they give you this buzzer thingy. My friends and I got seated at the lower round tables at the front of the store so it was a little bit harder to eat since the tables were very low but they had cute pillows from Line Friends! Wish we got the normal tables so it would've been easier to eat. 

We ordered 2 regular sized bingsu in mixed fruits (mango, strawberry, blueberry), and injeolmi. The mixed fruit bingsu was on the sweeter side, not because of the syrups but because the fruits were actually so sweet (probably in season??). The injeolmi bingsu had a really nutty flavour to it and was different in a good way. It came with condensed milk on the side and was topped with this powdery soy\/peanut idk powder, red beans, and mochi bits. I really enjoyed the injeolmi bingsu except for the fact that the soy\/peanut powder makes me cough when I eat it LOL..  

Overall, the restaurant is cute but the wait can take a while on a weekend night. The quality of their bingsu is also good, 2 regulars were filling for 3 people!",1.0

Great for a  family or group options. This is my first visit and I can't find anything bad to say. Some might call it fast food, but I would say great food done fast and friendly. Its pizza, salads, drinks and desert. So not a Italian resturant. Great if you have different people with different piazza tastes. Each person chooses the pizza crust and what they want on it. Even a gluten free option. You have to try it to believe it!  This is going to be a new favorite.",1.0

"When you go to Kia in Henderson, ask for CIERA! BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVERRRRR. As a first time car buyer, I was hesitant to go to a dealership because of all the horror stories I heard of..and the fact that I had no credit and little money to put down. Luckily, the first person that approached me as soon as I got out of my car when I parked in front of the entrance, was Ciera. I instantly had a good vibe about her. Her friendly personality and honesty was what I loved about her from the start. Normally when you go to car places, or any sales place, the sales people come off as pushy, and you instantly can see that they don't care about what your needs or wants are all they care about is selling...and they'll do whatever they have to do to sell you things...but not Ciera. Not to mention...it was her day off and she still came in! 
As soon as we started talking I let her know what my concerns were and what I was kind of looking for (I wasn't too specific, being that it was my first time) and she took me straight to the cars that fit my criteria. She didn't try to upsell me or force me into buying anything that was out of my budget and I loved that about her. If she didn't know the answer to my questions, she would try to find out the answer and not make something up or tell me what I wanted to hear. She was also extremely patient with myself and my five year old son. For example, I had to test drive two vehicles more than once because I wasn't sure which one I liked more and she never complained. She even stayed patient when we had to go back and fourth between my top 3 choices.
At the end of the day, I got exactly what I wanted! A beautiful car with no money down. I was able to get a good price for my trade in vehicle as well! One of the other things I love about Kia and their services is their cars, new and used, go through thorough inspections and tests. You won't walk off the lot with a car that's not in 100% working condition. Also, if anything happens to your car, you'll get free towing to any Kia dealership to get it fixed.
**MY MAIN POINT IS, GO TO KIA IN HENDERSON AND ASK FOR CIERA!**",1.0

"Some of the best Poke in town! Poke is one of the hipster trends I hope stick around. Le poke bar offers a few signature bowls but you can also design your own. The tuna and salmon always taste fresh and there is a large variety of toppings and dressings to choose from. I was pleasantly surprised to find kale in one of the predesigned bowls but i will definitely be ordering it again! All the bowls are very filling and I recommend getting quinoa if you're looking for a lighter option. Nothing better than enjoying your poke bowl on the lovely terrasse outside! 
Overall totally worth the $$",1.0

We had adults and kids (ages 11-19) in our party, and everyone had a great time and loved both the Cult of Mithras and X Child rooms.

"This was a nice little surprise. All the pics I've seen on Insta had me like YES! So I went for the drive on a Friday night. I'm originally from NY and besides family and friends. FOOD is what I miss. It's a nice little speciality store with a wonderful patio to dine out at. Me and my sons felt very comfortable to stay awhile. The menu selection was more limiting than I anticipated and asking for a few items seemed to be a unheard of. 
(EX:chicken parm hero)I was told we don't have that!?
I said you have chicken cutlets, mozzarella, sauce, and bread. All you do is assemble them together to make a sandwich. I've seen the pics online that it's been done before. The guy said ok it shouldn't be a problem. I received chopped up grilled chicken pieces in my sandwich with the other ingredients? It was good but not what I asked for or the taste I was looking for. We ordered a few different things including pasta. Which was very fresh tasting and the garlic bread was delicious. My sons enjoyed it. I'll try it again maybe order everything separate and assemble myself.",1.0

"First let me start off with saying that if you have never left the Carolina's and not accustomed to Caribbean food, please do not make posts about the food. Second, me n my husband are both natives from the North, and we know good Caribbean food. Thirdly, as soon as we got our meals pernil con arroz y tostones we both felt instant nostalgia. The food had such a feeling of home that I enjoyed every part of it. The atmosphere felt like home, currently listening to La India on the radio. The only complaint me n my husband had was our tostones falta sal (didnt have salt). If you arent going to appreciate something different please don't come here and then complain and for ricans, dominicans y cubanos looking for the closest thing to home this is it. We waited less than 20 mins to get our food and we were met within minutes of being seated!! We plan on bringing our relatives when they visit!",1.0

"Stopped in because we had a Groupon! Came actually right when they opened on Friday and so it wasn't busy when we first got there. I know they're open late so I'm not sure how crowded they get later in the night. Sat inside because it was raining while we were there so we couldn't sit outside. Normally they do have outside seating and it's right on the waterfront so the view looked nice. Dim lighting and tiny little booths, very intimate so this would be a great spot for date night. As part of our Groupon we got a bottle of wine and then chose the charcuterie board as our appetizer. The board was an interesting assortment but everything was very good. The main reason I'm giving this review 5 stars is because of the excellent service we received. Our server was very attentive, super nice and then I'm not sure if it was the owner or manager, but he was walking around making sure everyone was doing okay too. Loved the service! Would definitely come back for another date night!",1.0

"Welcome to the magical land of sizzling proteins and delicious drinks!!! The fajitas are really flaming! Oh man, why did I wait soooo long to visit?!?!?
Came on a gorgeous Sunday evening, hoping to sit outside and enjoy the weather. The patio already had a large party there and our group was large too, no sweat, we can sit inside. 
The restaurant is fairly large with a sort of divided dining are, a patio, and a bar that's separated. I like that it accommodates what ever type of night you're looking to have.
Now the food! I absolutely LOVED the shrimp and steak fajitas! I typically don't order steak unless I'm at an actual steakhouse but took a risk and it paid off! The steak was tender, not at all chewy and had wonderful flavor. The shrimp was great as well. Perfectly cooked with flavors of pepper and onions it was cooked with. I really enjoyed watching the server torch the fajitas, a nice touch that adds flare to the dining experience. 
The fajitas are paired with rice, beans, guac, sour cream, pico de gallo, and freshly made tortillas - corn or flour. You're able to swap the tortillas for romaine wraps, as well as rice and beans for steamed vegetables. Great option for the health conscious. I personally would not sacrifice the flour tortillas for a few calories, they were delicious! Oh, the fajitas also came with a little bowl of soup! I really did not need it as, the table tortilla chips were pretty good and kept me busy while waiting for the food.
Another star of the show for me were the margaritas. ON FIRE! I had the raspberry margarita that got me buzzed, followed by a shot of tequillaaaaaaaaaa, then a pina colada margarita... The Pina Colada Margarita was my fave, perfect combination of sweet and tangy. I look forward to having it again and again :)
The service was good, it seemed to take a little while for us to get our order in but we did not mind as we were enjoying each others company. The drinks came right away though. I am not a die hard fan of fajitas but can have them anytime if they are from here. Really!",1.0

"I had a nice experience here! The interior is spacious but cozy, with a wall displaying pretty much the fireplace channel. Service was really great - we had a guy who was very friendly.

I ordered the I Am Classic (paprika chicken, and I chose feta cheese to go inside, added 50 cents to make it spicy, and added $1 for the crispy cheese coating). Loved all my choices. The crispy cheese coating gave it a nice crunch. As for the chicken, I was expecting pieces of chicken in the crepe but turns out it is ground chicken! Oh well, still tastes good =)

Finished off with a dessert crepe (shared it) with sweet ricotta, honey, bananas and strawberries. I liked the option of the sweet ricotta, because it is less sweet than nutella for example. The honey had a strong flavour, and I think next time I may ask to substitute it for a different sauce, or have it on the side instead. I would also prefer just strawberries inside rather than with bananas too. We added ice cream to our dessert crepe, on the side for $1, and it was a solid two scoops. 

The drinks are mediocre though. My friend got the hot chocolate and he thought it was too diluted. I tried it and I agree. I could barely taste the chocolate flavour. I had the london fog which was ok but not memorable.

All in all, had a great experience here!",1.0
"Why hadn't I tried this place sooner?  The minute I walked in I felt super welcomed.  I have never been someplace where I have had so many personal conversations with employees.  The bartender Frank was so genuinely personable and attentive, and made amazing food & drink recommendations.  He was super accommodating to make sure nothing I ordered contained anything I am allergic to (wasabi, in a sushi restaurant, how annoying am I?) 

The Whiskey on the ROK cocktail spoke to my whiskey loving soul. Frank even educated me about the cherry on the garnish.

To start, I went with his recommendation of the crispy rice. It was an incredible flavor and texture combo, with just enough spice.  I will never NOT get this dish when I go there.

I went again with recommendations and next got the tiger roll and the Brussels sprouts. The tiger roll was awesome, but how often does a vegetable impress you?  The sprouts were the perfect texture.

The hospitality in this place was crazy on point.  I had conversations with the Chef (Joe, great food!!!) and manager, Craig.  Since I went for lunch, I missed the entertainment that happens nightly.  When asked about what goes on, Craig took the time to take me on a tour of the restaurant, and explain to me the different aspects of the entertainment.  He even pointed out interesting facts of the place (local artist for the murals on the walls, which is a nice touch!) 

Overall, obviously very impressed with this place, and will be back with friends, so we can catch the entertainment, and try more amazing food!",1.0
So thankful to have this amazing spot right up the street! This new spot is beautiful- so much work was put into the renovations here. The patio is amazing with a giant fireplace to cozy up to on chilly nights.  Per our servers recommendation we tried the cactus tacos and they were surprisingly awesome.

We got the 28oz Ontario beef rib steak to share between two people. The portion is huge, I think it could comfortably be split between two or three people. The steak was very tender and flavourful although not overpowering, would definitely recommend. It came with a large side of vegetables to share which paired nicely with the steak.

"I couldn't be happier with how Doggie District treated my little Yorkie on his 8th Birthday. He was staying overnight for a few days.

They even showed me pictures of his dog friends who ""attended"" the party and all of them eating pizza & sharing a slice of his cake.

"We moved away from Phoenix a year ago and I constantly about this restaurant. It was our favorite place to eat and we always took our out of town guests here. Today, we were able to make a detour on our trip to eat lunch here and I was reminded why it's my favorite. Our server Kaitlyn (and all other servers we have had in the past) was exceptional--attentive, friendly, enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the food. Kaitlyn took great care of us today which was much appreciated after living in a small town that lacks such fantastic service. 

We ordered our two favorite meals and they were perfect as usual. I got the seared ahi tuna sandwich and my fiancé got the braised short ribs and grits. We had to share with each other because we couldn't decide which to get. We don't even normally like grits, but the ones here are just incredible. Trust me, give them a try! The menu has something for everyone and the farm to table aspect means everything is super fresh. They care about the ingredients that go into the food and it comes through. 

We finished it off with some pumpkin pie, which came highly recommended--best pumpkin pie ever, period, end of story. Friends bought a whole one for Thanksgiving.

All their pies are clearly homemade and I am ashamed to admit I've eaten a whole lemon icebox pie in just a couple days!! If you have room, get dessert you won't regret it. Worth every calorie.",1.0
"Ahh.. The satisfaction of a perfect bowl of ramen noodles is hard to top. I had the October special, which was a Tonkotsu shoyu ramen, which comes with half a soft boiled egg and spinach. 

Every component from the salinity and richness of the broth, the tender slices of lean and fatty chashu, the thick chewy noodles that soak up the broth, to the soft boiled egg was divine. Extra points for the generous portion of boiled spinach to balance put the richness. 

My side of Age (a.k.a. fried) Gyoza was crispy and tasty, too. The creamy sweet chilli sauce was perfect for it. I was sad that there were only four small pieces!",1.0
"I'm caught in the middle of giving this place 3 or 4 stars but really I feel like the restaurant deserves 3.5. Located in Cosmopolitan on the 2nd floor, prepare for a long walk. 

Made reservations ahead of time for a party of 4 and got the Fried Chicken & Caviar, the menu says serves up to 4-6 people but I can imagine it serving even 8. If you do decide to try this make sure you call ahead of time and let them know so they can prepare the order in advance. 

The Fried Chicken & Caviar included two chickens that are fried whole, carved, then paired with a choice of Momofuku Reserve caviar, we chose the 8oz Smoked Trout Roe ($328) ... They provide you crepes that you use as a tortilla and truffle creme fraiche to top off. This dish was very intriguing but after some thought I don't feel like it was too amazing.. chicken was cooked well and was moist, and the Truffel creme fraiche was the savior... Put that on top of anything you eat and you got yourself a winner. 

We also got some small dishes to balance with the meat: 
Bigeye Tuna - shaved foie gras, stone fruit; I would say pass on this, it sounds good but it wasn't to my liking. 
Spicy Cucumbers - togarashi, toasted almond; very tasty and full of flavor, it was light and refreshing.
Chinese Broccoli - black garlic, ginger; cooked well and tasted good but it's like anything you would typically get at a Chinese restaurant. 

I also got a cocktail for myself called Toki Thyme, I really liked the drink! It was well mixed and refreshing to drink throughout dinner. 

Final thoughts: Service was okay, our waitress forgot about us a few times. The atmosphere of the venue and view of the Las Vegas strip was cool and chill, especially accompanying hip hop music playing in the background.

"This is your shop, folks   Earlier this year my son had a 1972 BMW motorcycle he had just purchased in Phoenix taken to Southwest Motorsports for work needed to get the bike home to Canada.  I was unaware so this came to me only afterwards when I heard about it.  Apparently there was a mix up of some kind.  A precondition was imposed by my son.  The work was not to be done without the authorization of a knowledgeable friend of his but the bike was innocently repaired without it.  However, the repairs were essential.  The bike had sat for years.  Without doubt it only got all the way home because of Southwest's excellent work.  In the end the shop took the high road:  it released the bike without payment rather than cause a fuss.  To me that's sound evidence of ethical, honest, caring and highly professional people who do great work.  Thank you!",1.0

Went to pick up my order in warehouse... The manager Byron tells me something went wrong with my order but they could order it from another store but it might take some time.. Another employee q says that they Will call me when it comes in. I left very upset that day. Two days later that same girl q leaves me a voicemail stating that she apologized for the mix up and that my order was ready now... Me and my installers were going to cancel my order because for sure we thought our project was going to be put back a few weeks because of the mix up.

No complaints coming from my way... Great team in the warehouse! Great system.,1.0
"I have been a customer of Mister Car Wash, after having used Octopus for about 20 years. As a member of one of the unlimited wash clubs, I have definitely gotten my money's worth at all 3 Madison locations. For me, Mister Car Wash has been consistent.

But this review is about some damage that occurred during one of my visits. What happened isn't important; it's the sort of thing that can happen to anyone running a business. I want to stress that this was an accident, and not due to any systemic or technical problem. What is important is how they responded: the management immediately took responsibility, apologized, and made everything right in what was turned out to be a complex situation.

Because of this response, I am happy to continue using Mister Car Wash with both of our family's vehicles. I recommend considering one of the unlimited wash clubs, since they usually pay for themselves if you get your car washed at least twice a month.",1.0

"For the price I got, I was not expecting much and that was fine by me. We are just stopping here for one night until a flight. But I got much more than I bargained for.

First off, there is plenty of parking, so you don't have to worry about the parking. The hotel is conveniently located right next to the South Park Mall, which is just across the street, so that is great too. The room was very nice, with a desk, two couches, and a big king size bed. Our room had a safe, coffee maker, and a fridge as well.

All of that was a plus, but that is not why I rated this five stars. That was because of the amazing service I received here. From start to finish, they were all very friendly and helpful. The bell man was very charming and helped us with our bags to our room, and gave some advice on dining that we took him up on that was great.

The following day, I was looking for a scale to weigh my bags, because they were quite heavy and I wanted to be sure we would be okay for the flight. The front desk looked all over the hotel but they seemed to have misplaced it during a renovation. She called just about everyone one payroll and they were all genuinely concerned with helping me out. Finally, she remembered she had a scale in her car (what are the chances) and ran out to get it for me. She even allowed me to take it to the room and bring it back later. She went well beyond the call of duty on this, and that was very appreciated. To top it off, she gave us a very late check out to make it easier on us to relax before our flight. That is the top of service you expect in a 5 star, so kudos to this team for being excellent.",1.0

I really felt like the sales team did everything they could to give me the best price and didn't make me feel pressured.

"On a recent work visit to Vegas we ate here twice.  It was so good the first time that we took our friends.  The food was fantastic (the octopus was to die for) and the waiter\/bartender (we sat at the bar the first night) was fantastic.  They have a Happy Hour Menu.  Now the second night was different.  We sat at the bar to have a drink and wait on our friends.  My friend had wine while I decided to have another Sam Adams.  The previous night, it was on the Happy Hour Menu so I asked for it again.  The bartender (His name was Kody) said that they didn't have it.  This made both of us do a ""What?"" and explain that it was on the Happy Hour menu just last night.  He said that they didn't have it and maybe the menu had changed.  My friend was still perplexed as to why they would still have it on a Happy Hour menu but not offer it off of the menu.  Finally the bartender (Kody) said very rudely ""Well just to accommodate you, I will take care of it"" but it was said very condescendingly.  He looked and low and behold they had it!  I commented how rude he was as did my friend. My friend asked to see the manager so Kody apologized very quickly.  The only reason we didn't push talking to the manager was that there was a couple sitting next to us and we didn't want to ruin their experience.  Kody did offer my friend more wine but never once asked if I wanted another beer.  Once again - rude.  When our friends arrived there was no way that we were going to eat a table so we moved.  My friend asked for the bill and Kody said that he apologized and that it was on him.  Still not a warm apology and to be honest we would have rather paid for it and spoke with the manager.  I'm just astounded that a place like this would have an employee that acted like that.  He could have looked in the first place and it would have been fine.  We were fine with being charged more since it was after happy hour.  You would think with a $600 food bill for 4 people that a restaurant would have a nice staff.  Our dining experience was wonderful but it was in the back of my mind the whole time we ate as to how he acted.  I'm not sure if I would recommend Milos to my friends with the chance that they to would be treated like this. Maybe I would with a warning to not sit at the bar!",1.0

"My first time visiting this business. The only reason that I'm giving them four stars instead of five is because it was hard for me to find. It's inside of a gas station. They are very busy they take orders online which is extremely convenient. The food is extremely fresh and very tasty unlike Roberto's. Great customer service, huge orders and very good food large portions. If you order from here make sure you are hungry because you won't be when you're done very satisfying. The red sauce that I got with my tacos was actually hot spicy and I loved it. 


Well yesterday evening I ordered from this business using the online app. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. When I got there my food was ready except they waited until they saw my face to put my toppings on my tacos they didn't want my food to get cold. When I got home I really looked at my food and I could tell it was prepared with love. It looked very good very neat and tasted just as good as it looked. I am now hooked on this business I will become a regular. This is why I have to give this business five stars plus they call me by name when I walked in I like that.


Well I thought I would update my review. I have been a customer of this business I don't even know how long I stop checking in I probably have over 30 visits so I am convinced I made the right decision by choosing never to go to Roberto's again. The quality of their food is outstanding and it's the same cooks consistent also they prepare my food like they're cooking for their family. They all know me so anyone who doesn't want to go there don't like the food don't like the place feel free not to go because there's plenty of us that go there the business has a following I know I see it I'm part of it. One other thing Ben and my girls that work there they don't curse they are a family business. But I do so if you want a five dollar Burrito  in five minutes then take your ass to Roberto's and shut the hell up. Just saying",1.0
"Bon, on va se le dire mais lorsqu'on va une fois au restaurant Park, on y va une deuxième puis une troisième fois et ainsi de suite. Ça c'est le résultat de la fraicheur et qualité des ingrédients combinées à un menu qui varie aux saveurs choisies par le chef tout au long de votre soirée. Effectivement au restaurant Park, commander les nigiris du chef et ils seront préparés selon l'inspiration immédiate de l'équipe de chefs savamment dirigée par Antonio Park. Le menu évolue et ces mêmes nigiris seront différents tout au long de la soirée !

It's neat that they have a gift\/shopping section on top of the groceries, restaurant, and deli. The store always seems clean and organized, and the staff are incredibly friendly. 

The upstairs seating area is huge and spacious! Plus, if you can't find an item, they'll try to see if they can stock it. 

Although it's a full-sized grocery store that caters to all tastes, it is a bit pricier for some items that you can buy more cheaply elsewhere. For example, I might buy gourmet or organic items here, but maybe not macaroni and cheese. Great array of items and specialty sections, e.g. gluten-free. I'm happy Harvest is in Champaign!",1.0
"I'm relatively new to Vegas, and I don't have the time to cook, so it's great to have an Applebee's right around the corner.I always sit at the bar, and DJ is the bomb. This restaurant is extremely clean and well maintained, the GM of this location really has it together. The food is actually better than other Applebee's too. It always comes out warm and fresh.  But what keeps me coming back is   DJ. I cannot say enough how incredible the service is here.",1.0
"I couldn't have asked for a better experience here. I was dreading taking my car in to get it repaired because I thought it would be such a hassle. I called and found out I could walk in anytime to get an estimate. I came in one day and spoke with Larry, who immediately looked into my replacement part and gave me an estimate, then told me it would be here in about 2 days and that he would call me to confirm and I could bring my car back in the day after the part came in. The whole estimate process took about 5 minutes. I got a call 2 days later saying the part came in, but was broken during shipping. Larry ordered a new one and kept me updated every day by call or text until it came in just a couple days later. He made sure it wasn't broken before calling me, and I was in the next day getting it installed. It took less than 20 minutes, and everyone was incredibly nice. Larry and everyone here did an amazing job!",1.0
"Wowsers what an amazingly spectacular experience. Best part, totally unexpected. My friend and I randomly chose this restaurant\/pub for dinner tonight and I'm certainly glad that we did. I honestly believe I had the best burger EVER tonight. If you ever find yourself at this wonderful establishment (with might I mention equally fabulous service), make sure to order the elk and boar burger. Yummy to the tummy!",1.0
"Wow authenic French cuisine! The staff is friendly, and  multi talented! My server said she is usually in the kitchen! Get the chicken entree ( I don't speak French and I forgot the name)  because wow. Not a dry piece of chicken on that bone, and the sauce was amazing. 
Crepes in the morning too! Comfy cozy lil spot. I'm with it.",1.0
Yummy authentic food at a fair price. Haggis was delicious followed by a lamb cassaerole better than my Mum made. No small accolade !,1.0
"Quite possibly my new favorite movie theater in the Cleveland area for large format, big-screen movie-going experiences.  Saw ""Dunkirk"" projected on 70mm film here and Stephen King's ""IT"" recently in XD.  Unbelievable.  The food is pretty decent! (for a movie theater...and there are also plenty of other restaurant options nearby).  I love being able to reserve my (reclining!) seats inside the theater, itself.  The parking is a breeze, and the image and sound quality here is nothing short of stunning.  

I saw ""Interstellar"" at an official IMAX Theater in Westlake a few years back, and it was an absolute nightmare on all fronts.  Parking was a disaster, and the screen was underwhelming (given the price...my Lord!!!)  I wish to high heaven that I had seen that film at Cinemark at Valley View in XD instead.  Cannot sing their praises high enough.",1.0
"We went to The Yard for the first time and thought the food was really fun. It was cold outside, so the parking garage next door was very convenient. We originally came for the house dessert, but were pleasantly surprised by our grilled cheese sandwiches too. The mac n cheese would have been better with a bit more flavor, it was kind of bland. The dessert was absolutely the best part of the meal, it's a sandwich stuffed with Nutella, peanut butter and banana and then deep fried in a batter that tastes like funnel cake. Then it's smothered with marshmallow fluff and drizzled with chocolate sauce. I was blown away by the size and the flavor. It seems like a trendy place and I can imagine it would get quite busy during prime time. The service was really great too!",1.0
The pizza was amazing.  So fresh.  They have outside seating which is really nice to sear outside and eat.  Great customer service.  Mozzarella wedges were really good  and we were served with our food in less than 10 minutes.  I will be definitely going back!!!!!!,1.0
"This is the place to buy your next car! I went with my mother in law and family to get her a car, and the experience was amazing. Harris was so kind and accommodating, and he was able to get us an amazing deal! Also, we were able to get in and out in under two hours. Findlay Honda treats you like family, and I'd recommend going for your next purchase or trade in!",1.0
Omgggggg the view here and the food and drinks were amazing! Definitely a stunning down to earth place to visit at least once in your life...,1.0
"Szechuan food is known for being spicy but the complexity of the sauces and combinations of the peppers lends itself to a depth that is so much better than that. The building heat is not at all unpleasant, actually. The first time you experience the mouth-numbing mala may be a bit uncomfortable though. It goes without saying it may be hard to have the best experience here if you bring friends who don't enjoy spice or heat.

Their specialties like the toothpick lamb and guess guess shrimp are the way to go- menu is large and most of what I've had is good, but the standout dishes are noteworthy because they can't be found elsewhere in town. The pork and\/or fish with green sauce got rave reviews from friends but I haven't yet made my way through that much of the menu.",1.0
"I love this place. From the moment I walked in, I was amazed by their interior. It was very simple and cute. The prices for the light bulb drink was pretty decent. I love how you can take it home! 


I've only tried the coffee matcha latte. It was really good but whatever they use is strong. I'm not even half way done with my bulb drink and I have so much energy. I'm a coffee and tea drinker and this coffee is hitting me hard. 

Workers are nice and friendly! They even make you pick out which bulb face expression you want & double checks with you if your drink tastes perfect.",1.0
Everyone is always so helpful and nice at this location! They helped me with my glasses along with my contacts and made me feel very comfortable. I would HIGHLY recommend Vision Source on Sahara!,1.0

"Their green salad is amazing! I also have their mushroom soup which was OK, and on another evening I had their lobster tagliatelle. The tagliatelle was done perfectly.",1.0
I had always wanted to try Eggslut in L.A. but had never gotten around to it. During a weekend in Vegas I stumbled upon the location inside the Cosmopolitan and decided that this was my chance. We stopped by before heading back home to Southern California. By the time we arrived (around 11am) the line was very long. I questioned waiting but decided it was now or never. So glad we waited. One bite and it's easy to understand that it's more than just hype. The line moves quickly so I highly recommend giving it a try. It's worth the wait.,1.0
This a great dentist office. We have been going to them for 3 years and have received exceptional care. Ginger is a great hygienist!,1.0
Dr. Wilson and his staff treated us so well. Very professional and personal with us. My daughter (10)  was very nervous for her oral surgery but as soon as she got in she was at ease with how they treated her. I highly recommend using their office.,1.0
"Used my Local Dines coupon today at the Half Moon and I must say the food and service was top notch.  I had my fears due to all the reviews knocking the service as slow!  We found just the opposite to be true!!  Service was both timely and attentive.  Waitress stopped by our table throughout our dining experience, couldn't ask for more. 
Ordered a large order of bone in wings along with meatball sliders.  The wife had a small house salad and a small order of boneless wings.  Wings were excellent and cooked to perfection.  Meatball sliders were tasty with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce and were a real surprise, very tasty.  
We've added the Half Moon to our sports bar list of go to places.  Hope you give it a try.",1.0
"Really god burger place, I tried the cheeseburger with bacon and it was filling and delicious. The crack sauce is super yummy- I really want to try to chicken Katsu with crack sauce on it next time. The burger was juicy, everything was really good- I don't really have any criticism of this place. It's a small funky little joint that I will come back to.",1.0
A legit location.  I had a couple display banners that needed shipping back to my office here in California which is why I went here to have them sent. Our company has an account with Fedex making it easier. The service was very good and they took care of my needs and were friendly as well.  Thank you for handling the job well.,1.0
"Waitress Jamie was nice and attentive. Sat at the bar because we came at a very busy time Saturday morning but I didn't mind. Got a juice and chorizo Benedict, both delicious but my bill was $21 for both those items so a bit pricy, that's the only reason for 4 stars.",1.0
These folks did a great job for me. I took my Xbox One in because it just would not load a disc. When I got it back it worked great. I highly recommend their service.,1.0
"I was looking for a cheaper car insurance, so i called FREEWAY because i heard they were cheap, but they were charging me a $60 down payment to join the company(thats what the agent said) which i think is was ridiculously expensive; so then i called I LOVE MY RATES and they only charged me $10, i am now very happy to deal with a very honest insurance company.

I always seem to have fast service here. I'm not sure why everybody else gives a low stars but they been a huge help to me. And even answered some questions over the phone that were important. This is my go to place for a third-party motor vehicle business.,1.0
"Went here the for the first time 2 weeks after they opened, with my bf & 3 children. We didn't really get to fully enjoy our meal with 3 kids one an infant. Food was good as expected. It's nice to finally have something good so close to home. (5 min drive) It's located in the Von's shopping center right on Horizon Ridge. Friendly staff &awesome manager I believe his name was Eric. We've gone to this place multiple times. 

Second time around we took one of my good friends visiting from California out to dinner & it was her first time EVER.. She's never even heard of it before and she loved it. This time around it was just adults. No children so we ordered 1 cold sake just to try & we ended up drinking about 5 hot sake that night, we started with appetizer garlic edamam & shrimp fried rice. She ordered the Beef Ramen, I myself ordered my favorite Tonkotsu Ramen & if I remember correctly my boyfriend ordered Shoyu Ramen.  At the end of our visit.. we had asked for our check and we were brought a dessert & the orange was cut so cute we didn't want to eat it. Needless to say this place is well worth the money spend. It just gets crazy hot there so dress lightly.

Third time around was our date night. Just a nice dinner & a movie date night. We walked in the Eric recognized us as soon as he saw us. We ordered our usual but this time we got the oysters and of course sake.",1.0
Super professional environment and polite staff. Equipment is very clean and you can tell they take pride in their services. Highly recommend if you truly want a spa experience,1.0
Everything was excellent. I had blueberry pancakes my friend had a burger...it was all great. While waiting in line to order they gave us a table number and found us a table upstairs on the balcony. My new favorite place in the Strip.,1.0
What a wonderful service. Order online; drive-up; park in a special designated zone; they bring out your order. Simple. Accurate. Wal-Mart grocery pick up service made it so easy for me to order from one state and have family pick up the order at the store of my choice in another state.,1.0
"Mother's idea for her special day.  She didn't want to have nightmares so we stayed away from the Zombie room (for now) and tried Terminal. This was my first time so my expectations were pretty low and I didn't have a point of reference, but man! The decor, the staff, the clues,  even the conference room was top notch.  Now I'll have to see how other rooms compare because the bar is set to high. Zombie room...you're next!",1.0

"Five stars don't come easy and this might be high, however, after the very bad experience at The Vu (read review), we happened upon this place by accident.  From the moment we were seated we knew we found something special.  Just a little place, looks like it seats about 50 people indoor with some outside seating.  The menu had several nice choices of Italian appetizers, the Rapini was a little overpriced for the portion but it was excellent, full of garlic flavor.  Our dinners were eggplant parm, chicken parm, shrimp alfredo and penne rigatoni.  All four meals were better than good.  The eggplant especially was one of the best I've ever had, so worth it.  As I said in the first line Five stars are hard to come by but since I'm still pissed at our experience at The VU, Marco's is getting the extra star for being there for us.  Thanks and you are on our go to list when visiting in the future.  Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.",1.0

"I can't say enough positive things about our dining experience at Coup Des Tartes.  We were greeted with a friendly welcome and seated in a cozy room.  It is unique as it has multiple rooms and makes you feel like you are in the owners home.  The meal was exceptional.  I had the French onion soup that was delicious and we both had the Duck L'orange and it was incredible.  It made our tummies smile.  The deserts were also wonderful.  The service was warm, friendly and very attentive to our needs.  The owner then came around and thanked us for coming.  This restaurant will exceed your dining expectations 100%.  I highly encourage you to run don't walk to Coup Des Tartes in Phoenix.",1.0

I was greeted quickly and my order was taken fast. I had the ham & cheese sandwich on wheat bread with a Dr. Pepper. It was delicious. The bread was soft and the ham was tasty. The only downfall was one size only for drinks and I didn't need a huge soda but that's all they offered. 

I recommend trying their subs. It's pricey but that's expected when it's on the strip.",1.0
This place is awesome! The tacos were really bomb. My husband and I were prepping for our wedding but we're craving Mexican food so we decided to go there and see what healthy alternatives there were. We had great fish tacos that tasted fresh and had a lot of flavor. We also got the mushroom quesadilla which tasted just like a steak quesadilla. Clean place and the owner was really sweet too.,1.0
"This is our second visit to the Sheraton in the last two years. We had another wonderful stay!

If you are an owner at the Sheraton and wonder where your dues are going, then wonder no more. Your dues are going to the constant improvement\/updating of the property. In the last two years, Sheraton completely resurfaced the pool deck and the pool. The pool and the chairs are of paramount importance in Scottsdale in Aug and they are newly updated. 

The other place your dues are going is the fantastic staff. Mo is the perfect Sheraton brand ambassador out at the pool. He remembered our family from two years ago and made our boys trip special. He always has a smile on his face and is helpful at every turn!  All of the staff at the pool and splash bar are extremely nice, fun, and super helpful. Everyone who works at this resort seems to really love it. 

Our only issue was upon check in to our room. The sofa bed had not been cleaned out and the shower had a bunch of missed areas (needed to be re-cleaned). I called down and spoke with the night manager, Annette. She was fantastic!!! Annette had housekeeping sent immediately to the room and they not only did a great job properly cleaning but they made up the sofa bed and the twin blow up mattress we brought. The entire bathroom was re cleaned from floor to ceiling. We were very happy!! Annette followed back up with us and we had a wonderful stay. 

Lastly, the outdoor grills are immaculate! I guarantee the Sheraton grills are cleaner than your grill at home! The staff is up EVERY morning cleaning the grills until they shine in the sun.

The bf and I needed to fuel up before we headed home from Vegas. We wanted to get away from the craziness of the Strip (they do have another location at the Venetian and etc) so we stopped by this location. The wait wasn't too bad but just make sure you go slightly before busy hours though!

We ordered:

1) Fried Chicken Benedict: Imagine a yummy biscuit drizzled with chipotle cream, eggs, mashed potatoes, smoked bacon, tomatoes and that yummy fried chicken! It's literally a savory mountain that you and your stomach need to climb over to reach that euphoria (aka food coma). I highly recommend this one. It's definitely fit for 2-3 people (5\/5)

2) Smoked Salmon Scramble: If you're looking for a slightly healthier option, the smoked salmon is delicious with the basil pesto, tomato, and melted brie cheese that is served with crispy potatoes. But honestly, I preferred the Fried Chicken Benedict (4\/5)

3) Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade: Definitely get this drink! It's not only perfect for Instagram but the drink is really yummy! If you don't finish it, you can ask for a plastic cup to go and take it on the ride home! (5\/5)

Overall, the food here is really yummy and I am not joking about the gigantic portions. The servers here are friendly and the atmosphere is pretty chill as well. Prices are decent, but hey the food is good!",1.0

The place was just starting to get busy, but it in no way took away from the great service I had.  The place has a fully stocked bar, so I had to have a spicy Bloody Mary.  

I started with the Cajun Shrimp appetizer and the flavor was spot on.  The shrimp were juicy and delicious and it comes with like garlic bread sticks to sop up the wonderful juices in the bowl.  

To top the night off, I was presented with a Brownie Sundae with candle for my birthday!  (Totally unexpected and delicious)  

Only regret was not going back and getting some BBQ to take home with me.",1.0
"I'm pretty picky about my ramen and I was very skeptical about this place because I had tried ramen at their sister restaurant (Kiu) in Markham and was not at all impressed.  I'm glad I went because this was a far cry from Kiu.  

Their broth was actually quite good and this time around, I ordered it without bamboo.  I've found that their bamboo shoots really overpower the flavour of the ramen and ruined it completely for me so this time, I decided forgo them.  Perhaps it was this change that made the difference but I am convinced that the broth here is better prepared.  They really should check in on their sister, Kiu because they're certainly not doing their ramen right there.  

Overall, I had a great experience and being so close to work, it's a great lunch spot to grab and go!",1.0
I heard nothing but good things about this place and it didn't disappoint. I had the Esquite fries and it was so good! They offer beer on tap which goes percent with vibe. It's kind of hidden but I'd differently recommend going out of your way for it.,1.0

"First of all let me start by saying our night started with a terrible dining experience. We were attempting to go to Cheesecake Factory at Crocker Park, and it was a nightmare. The restaurant lot was filled as we were stuck behind a 6 car convoy circling the lot. Then we went to the parking garage and it was full as well, all the way to the top and again we were stuck behind a slow moving convoy. So we ended up parking at Nordstrom Rack on the shopping plaza side of Detroit. We walked 10 mins outside in the blistering cold to Cheesecake Factory after 30 mins of the parking spot search just to find an overflowed lobby of people waiting at 4:30!!!! Why is it so packed at 4:30????!!!! We thought we were arriving just early enough to beat the start of the dinner rush. I hate Crocker Park! This place irks me. So we walked 10 minutes back to our car. I was ready to eat subway or even worms at this point but the wife was set on having pasta for dinner. At this point I'm very irritated but I love my wife so I pulled up the Yelp app and found Stella Mia which I had bookmarked for years. So I said screw it, we will check this place out. So I road rage my way all the way to Stella Mia and arrive already disgruntled and distraught with our dining experience thus far for the evening. 

The reason I just mentioned all that was so that you know I was pretty aggravated when I arrived and it would take a lot to have a good night at this point as HANGRY as I was! As I was eating my dinner I literally said ""Cheesecake Factory"" can suck it! lol. Everything was amazing from start to finish. The Hungarian Stuffed Peppers appetizer were the best stuffed peppers I ever had. I'm usually disappointed almost every time I get this appetizer at almost every place I try it at because the description says hot but never is. These actually had a kick packed with amazing flavors that weren't hidden behind the hotness. It was just a perfect blend of Hot and Flavorful! The salad was very fresh and crispy with a Balsamic Vinaigrette that was so good I had to make sure it was made in house because if not I had to know the brand. I could eat salad everyday with a dressing like that. For our entree we both ordered the Mozzarella Chicken because we are die hard Chicken Parmesan fans. This dish was AMAZING!!!! You can tell the Chicken was actually made there. It was pounded out to a perfect thickness and breaded with a perfect crunch topped with a bed of their sauce and finished with a  smothering of melted cheese. The sauce that was used on the Hungarian stuffed peppers, the chicken and the pasta was soooooooooo good!!! 

To speak on the experience spectrum of things I have to say what an incredibly attentive and friendly staff.  From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a smile immediately and taken to our table. Right away after being seated another server came to ask us what we would like to drink and told us who our server would be. Such a nice touch to have this kind of team work. We have had many experiences where we waited forever and already knew what we were ordering before we even got our drinks. I really like the idea of having somebody provide drinks right away until the server can make it over to the table. ""Jayme"" was our server and she was awesome! She came over quickly to ask if we had any questions about the menu so far and if we wanted to start with an appetizer so that she could put that in right away for us. She was very friendly, attentive, caring and just perfect really. She always had great timing when arriving at our table to check on us, we always had our drinks full whether it was her or somebody else going around to check on us. Multiple people checked on us. This place just really cares about how people are treated and wants to make sure their dining experience is special. This is why I love finding a hidden gem. Jayme, thank you so much for turning a nightmare of a night into a special one! We will definitely be back and will request you as our server if you are there when we are.

Note: probably better and cheaper to build your own bowl!",1.0

"Although the drive-thru is shaky at best, the food is still delicious. I have enjoyed every meal that I have ever eaten here. Bojangles' in general just does their food the right way.

"I was recommended this place by my neighbors on Nextdoor. It was a great price point and convenient in the mall (give me an excuse to go to the mall, PLEASE!) Walk-ins welcome, I was seen right away. It hurt. Threading HURTS!! But so does waxing. I have somewhat sensitive skin and would always have mini breakouts after getting waxed, threading totally takes the place of that now. She got every single hair follicle. I did my eyebrows (which I had not touched in 3 months, I was trying to grow out to reshape them, she did a great job!) and my upper lip. I will never wax again. I have been back multiple times. It is conveniently located outside Nordstrom. **Pro Tip: get a punch card! Your 8th (I think) eyebrow threading is free!",1.0

"I absolutely love this location! It is on the smaller side but I think that gives it a more homey atmosphere. Staff is super attentive and sweet. There is hardly a wait to be seated and if there ever is, it is well worth it! The food is divine, very tasty and the portions are more than generous! The pricing is very reasonable for what you get. My wife and I ordered edamame, crab fried rice, (my favorite) the duck noodle soup and desert; all for about $20. If you have never tried duck I highly recommend the duck noodle soup, the broth is so flavorful and the pieces of duck are very tender. I'm not to big on fried rice but this crab fried rice is the best I have ever had!!! You really get that delicious crab flavor with out it being fishy in any sense. For desert we had the fried banana with ice cream which was just as delicious as the rest of the meal.",1.0

If you haven't visited Mississauga City Hall, you really need to do so. It's one of the city's crown jewels, and an impressive and grand site for any event or private function.

Considering I've been visiting this place fairly frequently for the last decade, I'm still amazed whenever I walk into the central atrium. The building is sprawling and easily befits the city's status as the sixth-largest municipality in the country, situated right in the middle of the city centre and across the street from Central Library.

I was here last week for a ""fireside chat"" being held with Mayor Bonnie Crombie and former Mayor Hazel McCallion. There was an exhibit (which is still going on, as of this writing, until the first week of May 2017) that had a number of different pieces of memorabilia from Hazel's past, including some of her hockey jerseys, signed photographs, newspaper articles and other odds and ends.

(Yes, I have several of the bobbleheads that are featured in that exhibit. One of the few items I still own from my time at the Mississauga News.)

The event was bittersweet, in a way. While Hazel is still going at an impressive 95 years old, she seemed to be slowing down a bit from what I could tell. Not that it stopped her from firing off a few zingers towards politicians past and present, and giving her input on all kinds of things from the state of the city to the Leafs' chances to win the Stanley Cup. (""They'll definitely get it next year,"" she said.) It was a very interesting and unique event, and she was awarded with the Key to the City in Council Chambers - a well-deserved honor.

City Hall in general is a fantastic place to visit, even if you're not going for an event. They handle all the city services and the parking is dirt-cheap too ($1 per hour in the underground garage.)

As I've already made this enough of a puff piece, I'll simply conclude by saying that if you ever visit Mississauga, make this place a priority destination. It really is as beautiful as it looks in photos.",1.0

He always checks in to see where I am that day on a pain scale and ensures we work within those physical boundaries.  The workouts are never dull or monotonous.  I actually look forward to being ""pushed"" to my limits!!  He is forever smiling and encouraging his clients to push past what they thought they were capable of.  You will only go ""UP"" with Justin.  He WON'T let you down!!!!  He is my choice in a trainer.  Thanks for seeing more in me than I sometimes see in myself, Justin!

"I needed some work done on my Rolex and I saw many good reviews here about Desert Diamond Jewelry on Eastern which I had never been to. I'm so glad I stopped in. Bill was right there to help me, he took care of things fast, his pricing was completely fair, and he handled my watch like it was his own. I wish to point out that before he began the work, he actually gave me options that could have saved me money rather than cost me more money. It's rare that in dealing with cars, high end watches, or other things that have both actual and sentimental value, the person selling you their services will advise you on how to save money rather than make you nervous and get you to spend more than you have to. As a result of Bill's honesty and respect though, I went with the smarter, and better long term investment route which cost more (honestly not very much more but totally worth it) but which was by far the best decision. Bill is a craftsman at his job and a great person to deal with. I will never go anywhere else from now on. Best in Vegas. Thanks a lot Bill.",1.0

"Terri had brought through several family members for me and provided information that only they would know. She was able to bring in my grandmother who passed when my father was very young. The symbols and messages that she gave me were unclear, due to me not knowing my grandmother and being told very little of her, until I confirmed these with my father. Terri told me about the dog she had with her and when I mentioned it to my father he confirmed exactly what Terri told me.
When I went for my third reading I took my mother with me. Terri gave her such  beautiful messages and was able to bring in my grandfather, grandmother and other members, it was like a family reunion. LOL My mother had such a sense of relief and comfort when we left.

Dr. DiPerna is kind and thorough in learning about your dental history and your goals. He is meticulous in his work. He explains everything ahead of time and while he is working. Dr. DiPerna and everyone I have seen at that office have always answered my questions.  The hygienist and assistants who worked with me were knowledgeable and always very kind. Every appointment whether I saw Dr. DiPerna or a member of their team it was clear to me that person had taken the time to familiarize themselves with my history and we met with an understanding of my condition and goals. I have had at least six visits in the past nine months and every single interaction with everyone I met was positive whether it was directly related to my care, or scheduling or payment.

So we had to return that pair, but the owner was very understanding about it. I didn't have time to shop for myself, but it looked like they had lots of cute dresses.

"PHO is just like any other international airport.  It's got free Wi-Fi and the bathrooms are always clean when I go to use them.  They used to have showers to however, the nasties that were carrying on inside of them have ruined it for the rest of us so they shut them down.  The USO there does not have showers either so if you're trying to get clean while on a layover or just planned to take a shower prior to boarding you'll have to re think those logistics.  

It's improved seemingly every time i've been through there, especially the food options and it's relatively inexpensive given you're in an airport.  Just like any other airport allow yourself a decent amount of time to travel, check-in, get through security, then board and you'll be gucci.  Most folks complain because they get there thirty three minutes before their plane takes off and expects the same miracle to happen when they ""did it before""

Here's my creation: Salmon, Softshell Crab, seaweed salad, cucumber, green onion, furikake, pineapple, avocado, tempura flakes, chili garlic aioli, and poke sauce.  I'm telling you, they wrapped it so tightly that all the flavors melded together.  I am willing to drive all the way from California just so I can experience this place again.

"If you want to have a great experience in Wisconsin's capital, leave your politics at home and visit the state capitol building. I recently visited with my wife and friends from out of town; enjoyed an excellent tour of all the open areas of the capital. Remember Wisconsin Capitol was built as ""the people's house"" and there is virtually unlimited access to all the spaces. We visited the governor's office suite and Conference Room, peeked our heads into the Supreme Court, and went to Senate and assembly rooms. The last part of the tour was a trip all the way up to the exterior of the Rotunda where you have 360-degree bird's-eye view of Madison. I had been to the Capitol in the past but only downstairs in the lobby of the Rotunda. There are protesters each day which end typically at 1 pm. The capital interior is well cared for, probably by an army of Maintenance people, who make our Capitol building a jewel in the center of Madison. It's Marble, brass, mahogany and Cherry throughout. There are original stained glass and tile mosaics. A worthwhile experience not only for school kids but everyday taxpayers! This is highly recommended.",1.0

"In August of 2015, my cat, Rockie, was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor called a fibrosarcoma on his back hind leg by another vet. My family and I were presented with 3 options: euthanasia, leg amputation, or chemotherapy. This other vet was encouraging euthanasia. Albeit Rockie was 12 years old, he still had a glimmer in his eye and a spring in his step; I knew in my heart he was not ready to die. 

University Animal Hospital was a godsend; it is open weekends, and I was able to get an appointment quickly for a second opinion, which confirmed the information presented by the first vet. However, the staff notified me they had a competent surgeon on staff, Dr. Koch, who would be able to successfully remove Rockie's leg. Dr. Koch assisted Rockie and my family by amputating his hind leg and leaving clean margins of cancer-free tissue. Dr. Koch followed up with a phone call after the surgery and admonished me that Rockie's cancer could recur in the future. The research I did substantiated Dr. Koch's statement; I read that the amputation could prolong an animal's life from 1-3 years. Rockie recovered and lived an additional 18 months before my family discovered that his cancer had returned. This time the tumors were internal (near his lungs). We lost Rockie this past Valentine's Day 2017. I miss him greatly, but I am grateful that I had those extra 18 months with him. I cherished every moment, and I know Rockie did too.

"Café Forte is a delightful treat and not to be missed in Old Scottsdale!!!  There is a reason why they have been open since 1996  -- 21 years, you know they are doing something RIGHT!!!  

You will NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with the quality of food, service and ambience.  Syd is one of the owners and she is very attentive to her customers and ensures the quality of food is TOP notch and IT IS!  Sydney is one of the servers and she is also fantastic, very prompt and knowledgeable.  We travel frequently to Europe and throughly enjoy dining and wine.  Approximately, a few months ago we stopped in for lunch for our first time, prior to our trip to Italy and enjoyed a nice bottle of Tuscan wine that was properly stored.   We have been back several times since and the consistency is impeccable.  

Terrific Menu that is executed superbly, KUDOS to the chef!  I enjoyed their soup du jour a few times with crusty ciabatta bread and it was delicious with fresh ingredients that shine!  Try out their Cafe Cubano that my husband absolutely loved!

"I was looking for a place near by and found this on yelp.  Immediately drawn to this one because of the name, ratings and convenience of how close it was to the strip.

So I didn't know exactly where to park as this was my first time coming to Bally's outdoor mall so I ended up just valeting but I did see a self park option but again only at Bally's hotel.  I'm not sure if that is the only option for parking or if there is a different location that wasn't visible but make sure to drive around or look it up if you don't want to park at Bally's.

When looking for this particular store front look for Wahlburgers then go down the isle in front of it and it should be 3 stores down on the left side with a sign. 

Once you walk in it is very small, there is only 2 stations one on each side a tv in the center of the wall and then some clear boxes with nail color and design options on each side.  The lady who helped me was so sweet and very helpful to making my decision. Her name is Kita and she moved here two months ago from Orange county to help open this location. She works effectively and efficiently and pays attention to detail. Almost a perfectionist if you will but in a calm manner. Absolutely loved the way she did my nails from start to finish. 

F.Y.I. Just so you are aware this is in a container shopping area which are all small spaces that do not have water supply or ventilation implemented to these units\/stores. So without water NO MANICURES and PEDICURES are possible and with NO proper ventilation ACRYLICS are there for not possible as well. This for me was not the greatest thing to learn last minute as I had no nail length and a manicure was much needed. #justsaying

I had wished someone had put a tip on yelp or they relayed that vital info over phone when called to make an appointment which by the way is walk in only. Nonetheless I loved everything else and would definitely come here again for the great designs and work ethic on the nails but I will have to go get my acrylics done else where before I come.  It seems a bit of a hassle but I guarantee you if you are a picky or a perfectionist...coming here for a disign and or color is worth the time and money for sure!",1.0

I had a great experience and had a blast. The group I was with talked up and down about how the room was one of the more difficult rooms to complete. I definitely would recommend testing yourself at this room.

Now that I have done a couple other rooms, I do notice a few things that I would like to address. We had a few ""glitches"" that happened in our room. The final puzzle was a little touchy but the host came in and assisted us with this. (glad he had our back and helped because he knew we solved correctly, it was just very touchy. This kind of took a little bit of the experience away from the over all feel of it.) We did use clues and the hosts were great. And yes there are a very noticeable lack of ""effects"" mostly in my opinion because of lack of space.

"If you are craving Persian food at 2 o'clock in the morning , this is your go to place! 

Super Arzon is a Persian grocery store that offers fresh authentic Persian food made on the other side of the shop. I went with my best friend who is half Persian, and she did all the ordering. They grill all the kabobs once you place in a order, which makes it very fresh. I ordered the Vaziri combo, which has one beef and one chicken kabobs on top of basmati rice, with a grilled tomato on the side. My friend got Koobideh, which included two beef kabobs on top of basmati rice and a grilled tomato on the side.

The food portion was definitely more than I anticipated, but prices were very reasonable because of what was given. Although the location is quite far from me, I would make the travel there just to purchase the food.

If I'm not in a rush\/not broke I like to indulge in the ""pho"" which isn't particularly authentic, but just such a nice treat on cold winter days. It's only served 11:30-3:30 though :(

"I was a walk in on a Thursday afternoon around 1:30. Brooke seated me right away and listened to we what I wanted and told me because of a cowlick I have it wouldn't naturally fall that way and recommended another option. 

I wore my just different a few years ago but I had cancer and the radiation made my hair a lot thinner. I'm sure being 59 had nothing to do with it. But I haven't been real happy with the style I now had. Brooke went to work and when she was done it looked great. And she was fairly quick. The haircut was only $15. I normally pay about $25 so the price was a welcome surprise. 

Actually my ex wife was a barber so those 19 years of haircuts only cost me a house, a rental property, a car, and my dog. So this was a steal.

"We love dine-in movie theaters, but given that we live in Queen Creek, until recently we didn't have any options. We were so excited to try this place, and overall we were not disappointed. 

Pros: Alamo has a wonderful selection of food, drinks, and desserts. I found the menu to be much more expansive than other dine-in theaters that we have gone to. Additionally, they are very friendly to gluten sensitivities, so I was able to order most of the menu items (for an additional cost) and that was very convenient. The service was prompt and our food arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend coming earlier than your show time to order your food. Service time slows down once the movie starts.

There weren't any lines to wait in to get your tickets. Granted we ordered ours in advance, but you can buy your tickets after entering the theater and your server checks your tickets at your seats. 

Young children (under 3) are not allowed in the theater and any older children must be accompanied by an adult. As a parent myself, I'm not hating on children, we too take our toddler to the movies. That being said, sometimes I want to enjoy myself when I'm out on a date night without my child and not have to deal with kids kicking my seat. The movie was quiet and peaceful and it was a much more mature environment. There were still children there, but much better behaved because of their strict guidelines and 1 warning policy. 

Cons: For a drafthouse they appeared to be out of a significant amount of beer. The server had to come back twice to tell my husband they were out of what he ordered. Finally he just had them choose for him, because it was becoming a disruption. They did comp our drinks for us without us even asking, so the service was still good. 

I did feel bad the servers were having to bend down the entire movie. That was definitely different than what we have seen at other dine-in movies. I think that they could have designed the theaters better so that their staff doesn't injure their backs. 

Overall we very much enjoyed this theater and will definitely be returning in the future.",1.0
"I love this place, honestly it's not the most affordable but in general it's an amazing dessert with amazing options. I usually get some sort of matcha swirl or the blueberry cheesecake but lately they've replaced matcha with black sesame for a limited time and sheeeeeeeshhhhhh is it good. 
They only take credit or cash, and prices for a full woofles and cream item it would be about 11ish dollars. 
Also the service is really good, they try really hard to make you wait as little as possible and if you sit down they will bring it to u which they totally don't have to do. 
 I actually like the fact they're in a plaza food court, it gives ample seating which I don't feel would have happened with an actual location.",1.0

Happy hour was from 2pm-6pm and they had $1 Coronitas, but only at the bar. The food wasn't all that great so I'm taking away one star. The service was good as well. It was a nice open area for lunch with everyone. 

The only thing is ... I was a bit disappointed the rooftop was closed for a private event.. Other than that.. can't go wrong with the $1 Coronitas.",1.0

"LOVE this place.  Quirky, clean, EXCELLENT craft beers and POUTINE!!  What more could one want?  I was a little disappointed when we arrived and saw that they had NO ""guest taps"" - which I've used at other places when I wasn't a fan of the house brews.  No issue at all here - while I didn't love every beer I tried they were all very drinkable and at least good.  Their coffee stout (""Morning Sex"") was absolutely outstanding - so of course after my four ounce sampler I had to have a full pour...  You'd better like coffee to order this - it is FULL of robust coffee flavor.  The Belgian (""Lolli Blonde Ale"") was wonderful - with the reminiscent truly Belgian hops and a highly carbonated background.  Be careful with this one - while you don't get the sense of a high ABV beer, this puppy is 7.7% - yowza!  Also tried and enjoyed was the Imperial Oatmeal Stout (""Dark Side Till I Die""), a very nice varietal albeit a little light on flavor for an Imperial Stout (but yes, I would order it again if I was all hopped up on Morning Sex (yeah, that does sound dirty) and couldn't take another dose of caffeine.  

My wife and I split an order of the poutine - and it was very nice.  Not outstanding, but very tasty, and at a mere $5 quite a bargain.  If they used actual cheese curds rather than just sprinkling some feta on top it would have been much better, IMHO.  It paired well with their beer, however, and any complaint I have is a small one.

I am SO sad that this place is over an hour from my home...I would be a regular if it was close.  Hoping that family and friends need to be picked up at the Mesa Airport frequently so I have an excuse to go again!!",1.0

"I ordered spicy tofu soup to go.  They were sooo generous and included a separate BIG to-go container of their condiments like pickled vegetables, bean sprouts, etc.  I was not expecting that!  The only thing is I wish the spicy tofu soup had been spicier.  It didn't really seem that spicy at all to me.  I have eaten here before as a dine-in customer and I would definitely be back.",1.0
"I've always loved TruFusion and started at the original Eastern location and couldn't wait until the Summerlin location opened. The Summerlin studio has great interior space and design, very clean and has friendly front desk staff. 

I love all the variety of classes that TruFusion offers (and not just limited to yoga like other studios) and how many classes they have each day, giving me the flexibility to choose my workout for the day and with my schedule. And love their app and the easiness of looking up the class schedule and checking into classes with my phone!

I hope they can add or make some of the early morning classes a little earlier. I like how the other TruFusion studios have their early morning classes at 5:30a and 5:45a instead of 6a and 6:30a at Summerlin. 

From the classes I've taken, the instructors have been great and motivating but some of the cycle instructors should not rely on the fans in the heated rooms so much. There have been instances where the fans have been on the entire class time, but  TruFusion is about heated classes and why I chose to have a membership. As an instructor, you should be able to handle the 80 degree room and only turn fans on and off throughout class for moments of relief.",1.0
"I'm so happy that The Barrio Queen has opened up at Desert Ridge! We usually go to the Barrio Cafe but this one is so much closer to home. We were there on October 25th for lunch. We arrived early and got great seats on the patio. The hostesses and servers were all very nice and efficient. The food is the best upscale Mexican food in town!

"We dined at the Meritage for brunch on New Years Day. 

The ambiance for bunch is bright, inviting, and pleasant. The table and chairs were comfortable and a bit oversized, which I find that I like best. We were seated near a large window with a beautiful view. 

My family and I dressed up, but most people there were dressed down in sweats and jeans. Note to self for future reference! Also, the bar area had all the day's football games on its multiple screens. Good place to catch a game!

The food was awesome. We ordered the binets to start, which were fried exactly to our liking. My dad and I ordered a hash and my mom ordered the pancakes. All were delicious. The coffee was a bit strong, but who doesn't need strong coffee on New Years Day?

The Meritage lost a star with me due to oddly inconsistent service. Our primary server was on his game and extremely hospitable, but his assistant was in charge of our table for a bit and was either very new or poor at being a server.

"I could eat a smoked meat sandwich from Swartz's every day. Delicious meat, topped with mustard, on rye bread. Scrumptious. Not overly salty or soggy. They cook so much, it's always fresh. Don't be discouraged by the line outside the door, it moves quick! Once you get through the doors, your service is awesome, food comes fast. They are overly crowded, hard to walk in and out of the door. Bar is an option to sit at.

"Two nights in a row, we went here for dinner because it was located directly across from our hotel. At first we went because it was convenient. The second time we went because we remembered how good the experience and food were the night before.

They make homemade pasta every day. They also have a special chef that comes in and makes their mozzarella fresh each night. My daughter really loved their Caprese salad with the truffle oil. It was really good!

Our waiter said I must try their meatball. I say meatball because you only get one of them but it is really big. I noticed all the tables around me had one on their table too ... because our server loves it so much he's great at explaining that people should try it. I was glad I did!

My daughter really enjoyed their polenta tots. However, the tots were not consistent from one day to the other. The first time we had them, they were crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside. It was really a nice contrast. The second time we had them, they were not as crunchy on the outside so it seemed a little mushy. In addition, the second night we got half the size portion then we did the first night. 

Both evenings, we had fantastic service. I would say the service definitely gets five stars while the food and inconsistency brought it down to four.

Would we go back again? Yes! And I hope we get one of the servers we had last time because they really made our visit feel special.",1.0

There is a small play ground, a few shaded pavilions with tables, and a couple of benches. There are also bathrooms that are pretty clean for this being a park!

I've loved almost everything I've had here. My one and only complaint is the Margherita Pizza. It's very lack luster. It's crust with sauce and probably daiya cheese with some diced tomatoes on top. This pizza could be so ooooo much better! Just add large thin slices of tomato sauce with large flavorful fresh leaves of basil! Add In more flavor into the sauce! So much potential. Especially for a 12 dollar pizza meant for one person!  Love love love the portobello mushroom sliders and the tofu buns. Overall great place!,1.0
"This place is good. The chicken is crispy and juicy. I like the dipping sauce. Even the long drive thru lines tend to go fast most of the time. When they were new I had a problem with an order and the manager more than made up for it. I go here once a week and haven't regretted it yet. I wouldn't mind if they had some mac and cheese, though. It's always fries, slaw, toast.",1.0

I made an appointment with AC expert in Phoenix recently because my heating unit in my condo. I didn't know what was wrong with it but this company was able to come through and put a new motor in it.

"One of the best Italian restaurants we have been to.! Ambience is definitely spot on for a cozy family dinner.  For pastas, we had the White wine Tomato based Seafood pasta, Linguine di Mare & Creamy Fettuccine Alfonzo ( porcini mushrooms, chicken and baby arugula in a garlic cream sauce - boom! you could not get any better than that) . For pizzas my personal favourite was Tonino , it's simple cheese , prosciutto, basil and cherry tomatoes . Nothing great right ? Wait til you take a bit of the pizza and have the cherry tomatoes explode its juiciness in your mouth  !introducing all the flavours.  wOw!! What an experience . The more complicated pizzas would pale in comparison because all I can think of is this pizza . Can't wait to come back and sample the rest of the menu. 

There is a line up so be sure to call in for a reservation . We were lucky.. when we called they said a longer wait give or take 30min but when we got there , we were seated right away . Service was good (just a bit slow or I was just hungry) but they kept us at bay with appetizer bread. Their spicy oil was soooo good . Wanted to take some home .",1.0
I needed to find homeowners insurance for my new home purchase and was referred to smart move insurance.  Jessie was on the spot with communication and a quote.  The quote beat my Allstate quote on homeowners and as a bonus on car insurance too.  Jessie was great to work with!  I highly recommend smart move insurance brokers.,1.0
"Best food and staff in town hands down!  I am gluten free and they accommodated everything amazingly and made me feel so comfortable.  The bartender Bethany took time to make sure she had everything right and was so helpful and an absolute pleasure to be around. The GM Wendy and the manager Daniel were accessible to everyone in the restaurant and were so courteous, they immediately make you feel like you are part of a big Italian family, which I actually am! First time here but 100% not the last. Thank you so much for an amazing experience.",1.0

"This was pretty awesome! Fremont Street itself was rad with its insanely cheap tables and drinks and why not follow it up with a zipline below the neon light show?! We picked the higher line and it was worth it and also you are up there flying for way longer than I thought! The ride itself is not super fast, but that initial takeoff is wild and the fact you are pretty high up is just a super cool way to experience another part of Vegas. Love that you can look ahead to the crazy lights and music or down to all the ppl below. Also, we had some friends who could not make their time slot on the day and the guide was very helpful in explaining when they can come and reschedule. The guide said we could wait up to like 45 mins to get on our ride even though they assign you a time but we didn't have to wait too long, maybe 15 mins once suited up. Also, they provide a bag for you to put any loose items like cell phone, glasses, shoes, etc. and it straps onto your line so it goes down with you, easy and professional system. Fun times and recommend for sure!",1.0

This going to be my favorite Mediterranean place to eat! I had a veggie wrap which was huge & delicious! My companions both had the chicken shawarmadilla and they took 1\/2 home because the portions were huge. The prices are super reasonable & the owner is very friendly! The atmosphere is casual & you order at the register then pick up your meal. They are busy with takeout orders. The only issue was their drink machine was out of order so I didn't get any tea. The hibiscus punch was just a bit too sweet for us.,1.0
"Have been coming here for 3 years now. Staff is excellent and the doctor is great. I can get my retinas looked at without getting dilated. Costs me $30 but so what. Sure beats walking around with ""eyes wide shut"" for the rest of the day!  They have a good, not great, selection of frames but in the grand scheme of things the more choices the harder it is to pick. Right?",1.0
Peggy just did my wedding florals. They were absolutely beautiful and I could not have been more happy with how they came out! She created the most beautiful centerpieces that were honestly the talk of the wedding. So happy and I highly recommend using her.

"This is my favorite place to stay on the strip every time I come to Vegas. I stayed here once in 2013 and again in 2016. It is on the strip but slightly tucked away where car and foot traffic is manageable, almost minimal. The main selling point for me is the fact that Vdara is a non-smoking, non-gambling facility, unlike many of the other hotels on the strip, thus making life tolerable for allergy\/sensitive-smell sufferers. Since there aren't machines ringing at all hours, it is a relatively quite place. If one wanted to gamble\/party\/drink all night, the Cosmopolitan is literally a 5-minute walk away and Aria even less...at 2 minutes! HA.

The hotel does offer a lot of amenities. The have valet parking, bell services, a cafe and bar on the first floor. I believe the second floor holds the gym, spa, and pool. The pool is essentially roof-top and secluded from the road, although easily viewed from the surrounding hotels.

The hotel is very modern and chic. The lobby does not have have a huge, ""grand"" entrance area, but it is more intimate and appropriate for this place, in my opinion. Each room is like a mini-condo. Both times I was here, my rooms had a small kitchen area with a refrigerator, stove, eating space. It is usually accompanied by a living room, bedroom, and bathroom. The living room has a pull-out bed and 1 room can usually accommodate 4 people. I am not sure if all the rooms are the same, but this has been my experience.

Each room had window walls and no matter which way the room faced, there was always a spectacular view! I was blessed with a corner room during my second stay...if I didn't have so much planned, I would have loved to stay in the room to enjoy the views! My room was always clean and the facility always worked as it should have. Pricing varies greatly. They do have random deals so I usually book when the deals are available.",1.0

"I got the match tea with soy milk (hot). It was really good, you can really taste the matcha but I'd like it if it were a bit more flavorful. It was kinda bland but at the same time there was a little sweetness afterwards. I liked it but not enough to love it. My boyfriend got the mocha coffee iced. He really liked it, it was a bit too bitter to my liking but he enjoyed it. I do like that they serve you the tea in a cute cup and stuff if you order it to stay, but we ordered ours to go and it was in a plan plastic cup. Inside of it was kinda small, but it seem cozy and relaxing with some seats outdoors.",1.0
"What a gorgeous trail! Beautiful views. Clean and well maintained. There is a parking lot at the trail head with water fountains and maps. 

This hike kicked my ass. It's uphill til you get to the top of the mountain (I mean duh but it was still surprisingly difficult for me). You're basically climbing stairs for 2+ miles til you get to the top. Took us about 2 hours. A GREAT work out though! The whole time I was just thinking ""thighs and glutes, thighs and glutes!",1.0
The food is delicious and the restaurant is huge. We stopped by on our way out of town and thought by the looks of the parking lot we would have a wait.

"Amazing experience through and through with DWAH.

1. Through Leto's puppyhood and initial checkups they were patient, understanding, and thorough. They happily handled my various panicky moments as a first-time dog owner with grace and dignity. They were always incredibly warm, welcoming, and friendly with Leto (who, as a result, LOVES coming to the vet).

2. On two separate occasions (a case of giardia and a sprained shoulder), the staff made room for me to be seen by a vet within fifteen minutes of showing up unannounced. They were swift, prompt, and responded to my concerns immediately and professionally.

3. Their follow-ups and correspondence are beyond reproach, using phone, email, and text to keep me up to date.

4. Huge shout out to Dr. Bainbridge in particular, who counselled me as I endeavoured to address Leto's suitability as a running companion. He patiently answered questions, worked with me to explain x ray results, and thoroughly addressed all my concerns.

Their staff is always super friendly and their office is clean and bright. They are also flexible and accommodating--for example, allowing me to drop Leto off in the morning for an examination and returning after work for the follow-up appointment.

All told, they have helped me raise my dog from a ten-week pup to a happy, healthy, handsome sixteen-month-old retriever. I look forward to working with them for years to come and recommend them unreservedly.

They have free coffee, too.",1.0

Loren is polite and I never felt uncomfortable around him. He is my go to guy for appliance repair now.",1.0
"Planned to do breakfast before going to work today.  Looking for someplace convenient to our commute I spotted Sunny's.  Reviews seem mixed, but it sounded promising.  So we decided to do it.

The place looks like an elegant Denny's.  I mean that in a good way.  There is still the counter, booths, tables, just like you'd see in Denny's, but it's all done just a bit nicer. The first thing we received was water.  It was tap water, unfiltered.  In Chandler the water is very hard.  I think they should run it through a Brita or something just to take the edge off the hardness.

The menu seems quite varied.  It makes a good effort to liven-up the most boring meal of the day.  More than just eggs, bacon, sausage, toast. (blech!)  They have skillets (not served on a skillet, apparently), different ways to do eggs benedict, numerous omelette choices, etc.

I settled on a classic, the chicken-fried steak.  It was basic but good.  Perhaps a bit smaller than other places might serve.  The gravy seasoning seemed to be mostly pepper but it worked.  I liked it.  I upgraded the toast (boring!!) to pancakes, but found the steak and the eggs and ""country fries"" (seemed more like hash browns to me) to be enough.  So I packed them without trying them (probably eat them tomorrow at home).

My wife settled on the western skillet.  She really liked it  She also loved her blueberry pancakes.  She also commented that the coffee was very fresh and good for a basic service coffee (i.e. the coffee they keep in their carafe for refills on demand).  Evidently they use their own blend from Central America.  Perhaps not a gourmet coffee, but then we weren't expecting a gourmet coffee.  Better than Dunkin or Denny's or any fast-service coffee.

Service was appropriately attentive, and very friendly.  Seemed like a nice kid.

It's nice to know this place is available on our way to work.",1.0
"This place has everything you'd want in a coffee shop: great coffee, some tasty salads, sandwiches , and pastries to munch on, free wifi and plenty of outlets to plug in and get work done, along with a few quiet alcoves where you can relax and converse with friends. Combine that with a stunning space that literally attracts tourists to come take pictures, and you have yourself a winner.

Even though I live in Montreal, I only discovered this place when I had a conference to go to at the Palais des congrès. It quickly became my morning furling station and meeting home base during the conference. If you're in town for a conference or to visit Old Montreal, you should stop by. 

While I don't know much about the details, the café is also a co-working space, with rows of work tables and meeting rooms hidden behind the coffee bar. If I was a freelancer, this is the kind of space in which I'd want to work.",1.0
"My mom and I had dinner here recently and it was pretty good.  They changed their menu recently so the selection is a bit different than previous.  My mom's favorite shrimp basket is gone. :(  I had the shrimp salad - bibb lettuce, avocado, hearts of palm, cherry tomatoes, red onions, green goddess dressing.  I really enjoyed this salad.  Loved all the ingredients.  Nice big grilled shrimp.  Mom had the belgian waffle - whipped butter, maple syrup - and a side of bacon.

"I had no interest in going to a pawn shop in Las Vegas.  Especially, one located on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan.   But, why we're so many people walking in?  While we dined at DOCG next door, we saw large groups of well dressed people walk into this pawn shop and never return!
So, we only ordered 2 small plates from DOCG ( both were delicious- meatballs and eggplant parmigiana) and decided to check out what the black hole next door was all about.
OMG. 
After walking into the pawn shop, we were then led into a gorgeous restaurant with leather bound wood walls and a classic bar.  This is the epitome of a ""Swanky Place"". Having just eaten small plates next door, we opted for their raw bar while sitting at the bar sipping on delicious gimlets.

"Zipps has hosted my car club luncheon a couple of times and have done a good job. They were able to accommodate the 20+ in attendance and being that this amounted to 20 or so individual checks, the server did a fine job in sorting this out and making sure everyone received the correct check.  The food was a bit above average, I got a Club Sandwich, that included fries. The problem was that the sandwich looked like the cook had used two different pieces of bread, not two that were sliced from the same loaf. Thus, I had one small piece of bread and one large piece of bread, with the stuff between the bread hanging out a considerable amount. And the bread seemed a bit stale as the toasting did not put a light crisp on the outside but it was dry and crispy throughout. So, I was not impressed with my meal, but the others seemed happy with the items they received...maybe I am just picky. Zipps is a typical Sports bar with TV throughout with a variety of sports activities being shown.  For lunch hour they seemed moderately busy with a mix of customers from families with kids, workers from trades, office workers and young people. I think they have a niche and seem to take care of those who frequent them.",1.0

"Nobu definitely lives up to it's reputation. This was a last minute splurge that replaced dinner reservations elsewhere. The menu is extensive and offers a wide range of options. There was so much to choose from, we ended up trying the Omakase multi-course dinner with flights of sake and whiskey as we thought this would be the best way to experience the chef's signature dishes. 

Our meal started with cold appetizers which included chef's sushi and sashimi assortments. The Whitefish with Yuzu sauce just melts in your mouth while the crunchy sea grapes offers a different textural experience. The salmon carpaccio Salad with Lettuce Handroll was refreshing and crispy. The Chef's Sushi Assortment and Chef's Sashimi Assortment were decadently amazing. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeño, toro, Salmon Tartare with Caviar, Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar. Yum! The pickled peach that accompanied the appetizers was delicious.

Our hot entrees included their signature Black Cod Miso, which was succulent and both sweet and savory. The Beef Toban Yaki was tender and nicely paired with mushrooms and caramelized onions. I liked this much better than the NY bone-in steak we had for dinner the prior night at Bouchon. While the tofu was delicious, the miso soup was a little salty for me. I actually couldn't finish it after a couple sips. 

We finished dinner with the bento box dessert which included a sinfully rich flourless Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Sauce, Shiso Syrup & Green Tea Ice Cream.

"He is the best surgeon I found of the many that I sought before I met him, my experience with Dr. Smith was incredible because he was always worried that I would feel comfortable and pleased with my breast augmentation. I had two Operations because the first time to ignore the doctor chose a size too small and the results were not the desired, even though it is my fault the doctor scheduled me a second surgery running the clinic with all the expenses only paying me the co-payment this Second surgery I allowed the doctor to choose the size and I am completely happy and satisfied with the results. I also have to highlight the attention of his team mainly his assistant Veronica all the time to state for me, concerned about his patients and giving him the best care. My experience with these guys has been great and I recommend them all because with them they will find the results they are looking for and even more. Thank you For the work they did on me.",1.0

Months and are never disappointed. Brought my mom in and she loved it too. Great thing about this place is you can order as you go you so can try lots without being stuffed. Every day they offer a special item at a steep discount and this day it was grilled oysters and scallop skewers. We ordered both and they were both good. The scallops were really good. We then ordered the crispy chicken skin and marinated salty squid. Crispy chicken skin is like pork rinds, salty and crisp. The squid was not what I was expecting but cold and in a heavy sauce. It was really good. We then had orders of duck with salt, chicken thigh with salt, wagyu beef, smelts, mackerel and shrimp tempura and all were excellent. We ended the meal by having a passion roll and the special ramen. Everything was so good we left full and happy",1.0

Hash House A Go Go is a go to in my book. Hash House is open 24\/7 so this is perfect for brunch or 12:00 am.

"My husband and I had an early dinner here on Saturday after an afternoon at Discovery Place.  Since it was too early for us for dinner, we had some craft cocktails at the bar.  I have to say upon our initially seating at the bar, the staff didn't greet us and just passed over our glasses of water without speaking.  However, once we asked about cocktails, the waitress opened up a bit more.  I loved the Cellar Smash!

After our cocktails we sat for dinner in a cozy corner of the dark restaurant.  Ben was our waiter and was absolutely friendly and professional!  He offered suggestions from the menu in which we ordered!  Started with the oysters in creole butter sauce!  AMAZING!  I could have drank a bowl of the creole sauce by itself!  And the grilled baguette was soft and chewy, not hard and difficult to eat like baguettes can often be!  I chose the tuna tartare for my entrée (another suggestion from Ben) which was delicious!  I couldn't figure out the crunchy ingredient on the bottom and guessed it was jicama.  However, Ben said it was green apple!  Never would have put that with tuna but it was a great crunchy texture to the soft tuna!  My husband ordered the hamburger which got a thumbs up and we shared the brussels sprouts.  The brussels sprouts were on the sweet side due to the glaze.  Delicious but we prefer savory over sweet.  My husband was undecided upon a beer with dinner, so Ben organized a beer cellar tour with Charles while our meal was prepared!  He suggested the ideal beer to accompany his hamburger!  How neat is that!

"Went to see a concert at ""The Hall"" -interesting place . I didn't eat there - I just went for the concert . As you go in the concert hall bands had their merch set up in booths on the right and a bigger spot on the left . The bar is on the right side of the hall and restrooms were in the back on the right .

There's a lot to see once inside . They had quite a lot of collectibles and memorabilia dedicated to music . It took at least 30 minutes to soak it all in . It showed a lot of Arizona music culture . 

There are a lot of tables for plenty of seating - the room is large and without tables could hold a decent crowd if it was SRO . The concert stage is in the left corner - kind of different than the usual middle . Decent sized stage . Sound was crisp and clear . Lighting was ok . I did notice they tried to get a fog machine going but some fans dispersed it . Also there was a passageway with a black curtain showing the goings on behind the stage - it'd be cool if someone closed it earlier for better stage ambiance. Maybe angle the fog away from the fans ....small things that didn't stray away from the great night of music . I'm nitpicking I know ...it's those little things that can help ""sell the drama"" of the performances. The bands were all great .

"LA Fitness, this not an easy 1 start review to leave (but, since 0 stars is still not an option, this will have to do). In short: downright awful!

What I wanted was simple: to use the Free Week pass I'd received to check out LA Fitness's class schedule. The fine print on the pass says that you are required to ""sign a waiver of liability to use club facilities"" (to be expected) and that ""membership and\/or personal training options may be presented"" (but signing up is not required).

However, when my coworker and I arrived at 6:50 (ten minutes before the 7 PM Zumba class), the front desk agent insisted that we meet with one of the sales people before going into the class. Initially, we thought that David, said sales person, would review the liability waiver and send us on our way. How wrong we were.

Instead, David claimed that we had to go over the entire sales pitch (including a tour of the gym) before we could go to the class ""for liability purposes"". Since we were on a time limit, we asked David if we could meet with him after class. No such luck.

We reluctantly toured the facility with David, which took less than ten minutes. But, the ""fun"" didn't stop there, as the next 30 minutes were spent with David badgering us into signing up for membership packages, which we maintained that we did not want.

David and his manager outright refused to honor or acknowledge the Free Week passes we had in hand. Instead, they continued to be rude and condescending, and acted like they were cutting us ""special pricing deals"" on current memberships; think used car salesmen on the showroom floor.

My coworker pointed out that nowhere on the voucher did it say we were required to purchase a membership to partake in the ""free week"". David was unable to provide us with a reason that they would not honor it, but offered us a ""Free Day Pass"" as a consolation prize (despite it being after 7 PM and that we'd already missed the class that brought us in to begin with).

So, take heed fellow Yelpers: Apparently, when LA fitness says ""membership options may be presented"", it is a euphemism for ""prepare for our sales people to berate you until you think that signing up for a membership is the only way to end the pain.""

In closing, I can say for certain: 1) I will never consider switching to LA Fitness from my current gym, and 2) My coworker and I have urged our company to reconsider their corporate partnership with LA Fitness, based on this experience (we offer use of LA Fitness complimentary to our clients as an alternative to our onsite fitness center, and do not wish to subject them to this type of treatment either).

Classic and disappointing bait & switch. Though, I will say, the only perk about the Free Week pass? Learning what a despicable gym this is was of no cost to me. What a relief.

Outright rude and disrespectful to a customer.  So I decided not to have my car washed there and I asked for him to remove the codes he had scribbled on my window so I could be on my way.  He refused (this guy was not a ""yes"" man).  Locked my car and went inside to talk to the manager who was very nice and apologetic and offered a free car wash.

"I had been to Momofuku before when they first opened and I found their food pretty good if not a tad expensive, but I guess that's the vibe they were going for. 
However, today's visit to Momefuku was FAR from pleasant. We had a reservation for lunch for 6 people at 12:30pm for a farewell celebration for a coworker.  By the time we were seated it was 1pm. 

Now I understand its winterlicious and they were very busy. Hell, I'm a forgiving person I even understand double\/ overbooking. What I don't understand is that why the hostess when we arrived (early at 12:25) said that it would be five minutes before we were seated and they were just cleaning up the table. Then when I asked her around 12:40 she said again, five minutes they were cleaning up the table. Then when my friend went to talk to her at 12:50 to explain that we have to leave at around 1:30 (1:40 latest) because we had to get back to work (and we work in a hospital) that she then finally said that the table is just ordering dessert and we should have the table in 10 minutes. 

So just to be clear when at 12:25 she said then 5 min and then 12:40 she said five minutes, the group hadn't even gotten their dessert yet. At 12:25 when I first asked, that table was probably just getting their mains. Then she continued to say 5 minutes every time we asked. If she had simply told us the truth when I first asked, we would have gone somewhere else (I would have been a little upset, but more understanding). But by the time she finally told us, it was far too late for that. 

We were finally seated at 1pm. Most restaurants, when you have people waiting with a reservation that long would offer something complementary, or a discount on the bill. But no, the staff at Momofuku didn't EVEN offer an apology (not for the late seating or for lying about the whole thing). When I tried to explain it to the waitress, the brushed me off and left while I was still talking! We ended up asking to get our food rushed. We had to speed eat so we barely got to enjoy the meal. 

The only pleasant thing I can say is that the food was good (which is what the two stars are for), but nothing exceptional (other than their cereal milk ice cream which i can't help but love!). However, considering all the options for delicious ramen around Toronto (that is usually cheaper with much nicer staff), I doubt I will be returning here.",0.0
"BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY. Read all the reviews, not just the few showing on the first page.

We would have never rented from them if we knew that.
..... As far as enjoyment on of the day of rental, there is no complaint.  They told us that day that all was well with the machines when returned and we'd get our deposit in 7 - 10 days. We waited till the 11th day and called. We were told there wasn't any problem with the machines and Marshall told us he had sent the credit in several days prior. Talked to our credit card company and they showed no pending credit, so called Marshall back and asked for the date he sent it to the bank. He was short with us, saying they are very busy but he would check. Never called us back and when we called him he gave us different excuses why he couldn't give us the date he had sent it in. Some of the excuses: we're too busy, I'm not at my desk and don't carry around the books, all are sick, the bank is messing up, the safe is locked and his boss isn't there to open it. We were just asking for the date he sent it in.  When he threatened to 'call the police' if we called again, we figured we had a problem on our hands.  Was hard for us to realize that a company would treat their customers like this.  Finally had to go physically to their place of business and confront them. Sat in front of Marks' desk (he threatened to throw us out) until he signed a paper saying they would credit our account that day.

"I brought my toddler with me and he tried a few ice cream flavors before deciding on which one we wanted in our sandwich. As I ordered, i asked if he could place the ice cream in a bowl because my toddler's mouth was too tiny to take a bite of the tall sandwich. Unfortunately, he said he'd have to charge me for the individual items if he deconstructed the sandwich in any way. Normally, it wouldn't have bothered me but he watched me come in with a toddler and give him the samples. This wasn't some scheme to get an extra paper bowl or plate. He told me I'd have to deconstruct it myself or pay an extra $1.40. So, of course, I opted to do it myself, sans the proper scoop and spatula that he used. He did give me a small cup to use and i used the plastic spoon to make the sandwich edible for a tiny mouth instead of it being all over the floor, attempting to eat it on his own. The cookies were mediocre and would've garnered a 3 rating. It just went against common sense to not oblige my request when I got the exact same ingredients and just wanted to make a small adjustment. We were the only customers, so i wasn't holding up the line.",0.0

A decent dessert option in the Kensington area. I had the Nordic (smoked salmon, capers, cream cheese) and the Tutti Frutti waffles. The man working the cash register and the waffle griddles by himself is quite efficient and friendly. The waffles themselves weren't bad, but weren't exceptional. The nordic: there wasn't enough salmon to balance the amount of waffle (which was pleasantly dense).

"Well not sure where to start but if you want poor service go here. I got my oil changed here in January. They were very fast i was in and out in about 15 minutes. I was happy with the job they did. Now fast forward 2 weeks I started to notice spots on my paver stone driveway. I thought it may be just liquid from my air conditioning being on in my car. No it was oil leaking from my car. I have a brand new kia and I know it wasn't an issue with the car. But just in case it was I took it to my local kia dealership to have it checked out. The mechanic there informed me that whoever did the work on my car didn't tighten the drain plug on my car. They said finger tight. With that said I had to have the oil changed again within a month. Thanks valvoline. So I pursed to get my money back and to have my driveway repaired. I contacted valvoline corporate they responded back in a timely manner which I loved. Charles dick exoress care advisor emailed me apologizing for the mess in my driveway and stated ""Our Express Care locations are independently owned and operated, however, I have tasked them with cleaning up your driveway and making good regarding the second oil change you had to pay for. This was amazing feedback and I felt like I was being taken care of. However, I waited over a week to hear from the owner of this location nothing was done on his\/her end. I emailed Charles back and he went back on his original email by now stating ""Valvoline has no responsibility other than making a recommendation regarding a solve to the issue.""

"Stay away from this company! The owner, office manager, and project manager have all been a headache to deal with and were contentious from the first time we brought an issue to their attention.

We hired Signature to do a kitchen remodel in a new home that we purchased. We should have known that we were in for a nightmare from the beginning, when they refused to give us any details. None of the items on the contract were priced out. The contract just said 6-8 weeks, which they really meant 6-8 weeks from the time they started work--a month after we signed. The emails from our project manager, Michelle, were always vague with no dates or schedule. 

Then as work began, more problems arose. When we were not home, Michelle decided to go through one of our downstairs rooms (we are only renovating the kitchen so there is no need for her to go downstairs) and she took one of our chairs and decided to use it while she was waiting for the owner in our kitchen. She left the chair there and it was covered in dust when we saw it the following weekend. When we asked her about it, the office manager, Casey, tried to justify Michelle's actions saying that she has every right to use our things when we ""invite"" them into our home. I'm glad we didn't move in yet and have valuables in our home. Complete breach of trust! 

The last straw was when we visited the house while they were putting up cabinets. There were huge holes in the walls that they were trying to cover up with the cabinets, there were gaps in the shelving (i.e. the shelves weren't cut to the right size), and painted areas did not match the existing paint (see pictures). I asked the owner, Ben, and the cabinet installer to leave because they were arguing with me about the issues saying that they were not a big deal. The owner refused to listen to my concerns and correct them. The office manager and owner later wrote several rude, threatening emails to me.

"Ive always wondered if this place was as good as any other Roberto's joint so I've decided to meet my lady on her lunch break there for 99 cent chicken tacos. The first taco my lady had was ay okay. The second was for me and as soon as i took a bite it was hard as rocks! I opened up the crunchy taco thinking that was the culprit and took another bite and still hard as rocks! The 99 cent chicken was overcooked to a crisp! I brought it up to the front to have them remake properly because it was too crunchy. 

The cashier looked at me and then called the cook over. I said ""look its extra crispy like a dam potato chip"" and this cruella devil looking lady had the audacity to tell ""its suppose to be crispy"" i immediately opened up the taco grabbed the hard ass chicken and pinched it to the point that it started crumbling down to the counter top.

My lady just had one and it was jus right not even crispy! So she looked at me and rolled her eyes and preceded to make another with a fit. Over some 99 cent tacos though!?

"Dollar is by far the WORST rental company I have ever death with!! 

First, we originally rented from ""Thrify"" and a week before our vacation we received an email that Thrifty closed and they sold our rental to Dollar. As we stood in line and waited to be helped, and the woman behind the counter looked up at us and said, ""Are you ready yet"" (nice greeting, huh?). Then she tried to sell us on their insurance, which I declined. Nt only do I have my own auto-insurance, that covers rental car insurance, but, I have rental car insurance on the major credit card I use. So, I declined the insurance, and she looked at us all big-eyed and said, ""You don't have insurance!!??"". Like I was an 18-year old that doesn't know any better. I explained how I do have insurance and she started asking me through which insurance company. Isn't that my business and not hers!?
.
She proceeded to enter our information, and I explained how Thrifty sold our rental to Dollar and the price was supposed to remain the same (which I had in an email from Thrifty). Nope!! We received our bill 3-days after we returned the car and they charged us more money! Dollar charged us for a 3-day rental instead of 2-days, and charged a late return fee (in which it was not returned late!)

I called Dollar customer service 800#, and spoke to a extremely rude woman, who hemmed and hawed at my request for a refund, in which she said I was not due one, since I rented the car for 3-days. I explained I only rented it for 2-days, and I had proof from my airline ticket & hotel of me flying out on the day I returned the car. And she was literally arguing with me saying I rented it for 3-days. I then asked to speak to a manager, and someone ""claiming"" to be a manager said it would take a week or more to put in a refund ""request"" to settle a bill dispute. When I asked for her last name, she said they do not give their last names. When I asked for an email for a confirmation of the conversation on the bill dispute, she said they don't send emails.

"Came here to pick up some drinks before a ""Valentine's Dinner"" on well valentines day. Lol Located in a shopping center across from the Wal-Mart on Fort Apache, its a place that is fairly easily accessible with ample parking around. Apparently this place is fairly new and the hours are fairly limited (open at 12 and close at 8)

After seeing all the great reviews and it being a newly opened place, I had to check it out. Not the biggest location but it is fairly open with a decent amount of seating. A lot of customers seem to come here to study. There are some power plugs spread around the store so good for those who you laptops or need a charge. 

Staff was friendly and kind of helpful. They didn't answer me much when asking about how their sweetness was. Just told me to order a lower one, if not sweet enough, they can add. 

This trip, I had picked up 3 drinks. All at a sweetness of 50% as myself, and my 2 other friends don't particularly like our drinks that sweet, usually. 

Dark Knight - heavy roasted oolong milk tea with herbal jelly
Diamond Grape - oolong tea infused with white grape topped with crystal boba
Peach Lucy - peace oolong infused ice tea with peach puree

I, personally, had ordered the Dark Knight. The sound of heavy roasted oolong and herbal jelly sounded really good. I'm fairly picky with my teas and love a strong tea flavor. This was far from strong. Tasted very diluted, not with the milk, but seemed diluted with their ""chilling process"" with ice. I had heard shakers being used. I've been told there's a limited time you should shake otherwise it gets too diluted, and this is probably why. Out of the 3 drinks, mine tasted like slightly flavored water. Herbal jelly was really mild as well. Very disappointed :( 

Out of the 3 I had tasted, I think the diamond grape tasted the best. Nice crisp texture from crystal boba with the flavorful white grape infusion to the still not so strong oolong tea. White\/green grape has been a favorite in terms of drink flavor so this tasted pretty nice. 50% was perfect in my opinion. 

Peach Lucy was not bad but definitely not the worst of the 3. My friend had requested to add crystal boba so it added the nice crisp texture to the flavorful drink. Not too sure where the peach puree was but maybe they added it to mix? 

Prices weren't bad. 1 size only. Apparently according to the guy who helped me stated it costs 50 cents MORE for a smaller size. 

Overall, 2 of the 3 drinks weren't bad. Though I feel like it is a bit of false advertisement when they say its a heavy roasted oolong. Oolong is not particularly a light tea either if brewed correctly. It was very diluted and disappointing. Hopefully they'll improve on that aspect or just work on only fruit flavored teas or something.",0.0

"Let's get down to it. Two long time vegan travellers visited for the first time yesterday for Saturday brunch. The decor while nice, can best be described as ""pintresty"". High ceilings and hallway-like space makes it a bit loud. I had the vegan Big LOV burger, she had the vegan Haskap Berry Grilled Cheese, and we shared a side of potatoes. 

The first bite of the burger gave an immediately reaction that I had that taste before. Then I realized the name and recognized the taste as a Big Mac, pretty spot on! I cannot say that I missed that taste, but I can't say that it was bad - just wasn't ""wowed"". The taste was more from the sauce and mix of pickle\/toppings than the burger. In fact, having a bite of the burger alone without the bread or anything else on it was surprisingly bland. It tasted like what it was - black beans.

The Grilled Cheese was pretty darn good though, for a grilled cheese! If you are looking for something different I would recommend that over the burger.

The potatoes were perhaps the best! It was a take on poutine with a vegan cheese sauce and a maple\/sriracha syrup. There was enough syrup to dip the burger in and give it a bit more of a zip!

Service was OK\/neutral. The food came out fairly quickly even though the restaurant was nearly full, but we waited a bit after we finished and ended up having to ask for our check.

"DO NOT STAY HERE BE WARNED I wanted to plan a spontaneous trip to Las Vegas for my boyfriend and I so I booked here because the rate I got was $51 a night for their regular suite. That was a mistake I would definitely recommend spending the extra money to stay somewhere else. I want REALLY WANT to emphasize that this is an ""extended stay"" hotel Im sure you can infer what that means, PEOPLE LIVE HERE as soon as we got here I was able to figure out very quickly that this was not a typical hotel.

As soon as we got there I felt extremely unsafe if you are traveling with children or even young teenagers I would NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. As an adult I felt very unsafe here and was nervous to leave my car parked outside overnight. When we first entered the room I was literally bought to tears due to the condition that it was in (although I can be a little dramatic and I was emotional because I felt extremely disappointed since I put a lot of thought into this surprise trip for my boyfriend and I). I wanted to leave and immediately started looking for other places but was unable to find a place that would've worked so we were forced to stay.  There was a shattered picture frame hanging above the bed, ambiguous stains in the bathroom, the light in the bathroom was so obnoxiously loud I didnt want to turn it on. I would recommend slippers or shoes when walking around the room because it feels dirty, we even showered with slippers on. I checked the beds for bed bugs and luckily didn't find any but if you stay here be sure to check. The room had a faint smell of cigarettes and I noticed cigarette burns in the blankets, the bed turned out to be the best thing in the room compared to everything else but then again there wasn't much of a competition. They offer Wifi but it was so frustratingly slow that we ended up just not using it. One thing that was satisfactory about our stay was the customer service they were prompt, provided more towels when needed, and when we called for maintanence they arrived quickly. We decided to make the best of our stay there but we will never ever stay here again.

The food really was disappointing. We had a table of 11 adults. The only dishes which stood out as amazing were the Mushroom risotto and fried calamari.

Duck and Steak was cooked medium as requested but was dry. Seafood risotto had no risotto flavour, was overpowered by the red sauce.

Veal shank was salty and didn't taste much like tender veal... was probably over-cooked so the meat was dry.. and then over powered by the red sauce.  I would say the one marrow in the veal shank was the highlight.

"My daughter and I went to the Prairie Lakes location yesterday as new patients. I had hoped that a local optometrist would offer a better experience than the typical Luxotica owned chain stores but we had just a ""Meh"" experience. From the time I scheduled the appointment to the actual appointment there were several checks on insurance coverage and payment, but not one question why I am making the appointments. I do undertstand the need to get paid for service but this should have tipped me off that the business has more of a transactional focus than a care focus.

My appointment was with Dr. Kovacs and she was very professional and pleasant. Thorough, not rushed and explained everything. I would recommend her. The reception and sales staff on the other hand couldn't seem to be bothered. I had better service at the DMV. Very cold and unpleasant. Frankly, I could not wait to leave even though ordering glasses and contact lenses online or at another store is an inconvenience.

"It was disappointing for being a Vegas buffet.  The wait was short for dinner on a Saturday night.  Host, waitress and seafood station guy were nice.  Sushi was real bad, hard rice and not fresh fish.  The crab legs and crab claws were bad even though I got them steamed.  Seafood station guy had a nice attitude but ruined my seafood stew by adding way too much garlic, I asked for a lot of garlic and and he put in the size of an egg.  It was inedible.  The highlight was the carving station and the ice cream.  All meats at the carving station were really good.  However, I left wishing for more.  The crab legs and sushi are better at my local buffet in Glendale that charges $25.",0.0
"Went there with 2 colleagues last night. Food seemed ok. Service was slow. I ran out of margarita  and my back-up water about halfway through the meal. Waiter didn't come back until a long while after I had finished. Took over 20 min between asking for the check and getting it.

Now for the fun part. Around midnight, I woke up with some stomach pain. Took a pepto and went back to sleep. 4:30am: I woke up in distress and had the worst, burning diaharrea of my life. This muddy-water like fun continued every hour through til now. Oh, and how the smell lingered. I think the name Diablo's Cantina comes from the fact that the devil is in the food and will exit through your burning a-hole later that night to haunt your bathroom.

When I went to go meet my colleagues in the lobby this morning, I found that another one had had the same thing, but due to a lack of pepto, had been vomiting as well. The third colleague was fine. We figured out that the two of us that are ill, had a little bit of the hot sauce. We figure that that bottle or batch must be tainted as we both like spicy food and it wasn't that hot.

"I heard this place was really good. we had a large party. our server ""cisco"" was all over the place, took a long time for anything, messed up our order pretty bad and seemed to be first day on the job as he couldn't answer questions about entree's (all he said was ""it''s really good""). Then there was some bigger guy with balding hair and i'm pretty sure he was a manager. This guy was helping running food out to our large party and i saw him from about 10 feet away kind of arguing with my 13 y\/o son. my son had ordered mac n cheese with fries and this guy brought him mac n cheese with a pineapple slice. my son said he didn't like the pineapple and wanted the fries. i saw this big guy give my son a dirty look and said ""just take this one"" and set it down and walked away. right there is stood up and approached the guy and asked if everything was ok over there and he said ""yea it's all good, the kid is bugging me for fries but he can have the pineapple"". BUGGING YOU FOR FRIES??? isn't this a restaurant? I always thought in a restaurant you order what food you want off the menu and get it.....not take what the drop in front of you. come to find out, this plate of mac with a pineapple was another kid at the other end of the table. if this big guy would have just politely asked, then all of this would have been avoided. Soon after that one of  the parents were going to the restroom (right by the kitchen) and overheard this same big balding manager talking to some servers claiming how difficult our party was and couldn't wait for us to leave. Is that what a manager should think about a group of around 40 people? I would think that a group that large would bring in some nice money for the restaurant and that a manager would be happy and not complain about his guests like that (or at least where he could be heard). to top it off a few people (about 9) got sick from the food. not sure what they ate, but i had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was OK. OK meaning i didn't get sick and the taste was average. to sum up this review, it was my first ever experience at a famous Dave's BBQ and will most likely be the last, at least at this location. As for that big manager, maybe you should go work as a dishwasher, that way you can complain all you want to the dirty dishes and your guests will not have to experience you poor attitude.",0.0

Only complaint I have about the truck I rented is that it stunk like pee inside the driver's cab and when I turned on the A\/C the entire cab filled up with dust. The men working outside who give you the keys were for the most part friendly but I had little interaction with them, other than asking who the manager was so I could complain about Marisa.

"Having been to Hawaii several times and enjoying poke there I was so excited to try this place! Especially after all the great reviews. The Hawaiian poke here though visually* looks awesome the color and everything, but taste wise it didn't have much flavor at all. I was really surprised on that. It made me wonder where they got there fish from and if it was farm raised as well as if dye was added to give the fish that color....And the seaweed was so mushy and I love ordering seaweed at different places.

"First the good, the food was delicious. Everyone at our table enjoyed the summer menu, which is a prix fixe menu that also includes a cocktail. No complaints here, the duck salad and dim sum were worth the visit. The salad was the overall table favorite. The entrees were balanced and had great flavor. My future Son-in-law who apparently hates green beans annihilated their stir-fried green beans, and is currently reconsidering his hatred, so that's a win! Dessert was delish and the cocktails were strong.

Soooo...the not so good. When we arrived and were perusing the menu the bus person overheard us and let us know that everything listed was included with the summer menu. (Which, by the way, the busser was about 1000x's more personable than our server) Well...when we ordered our server indicated that was not the case and that we could make one selection from each category. But that he ""would check"" to see if that was the case?? Now normally I wouldn't balk at this kind of thing. However,  when your getting ready to drop a CAR PAYMENT on dinner I feel like you can do a sister a solid and go ahead and throw in a cup and 1\/2 of pork and some veggies, I mean really. Not to mention, the server should know without having to double-check. Well, we ended up getting everything, and it would have felt pretty chintzy had we not. 

The worst...as dinner was winding down, I ordered a second cocktail. I waited through the entrees, AND dessert, AND had to ask again, then completed dessert, and was getting really annoyed. I decided at that point I wasn't going to receive the drink but also was not going to pay for it!! Our server was MIA. Finally it arrives when we were pretty much ready to leave. I normally do not let these things get to me, and would remain pretty zen about it. However, at this price point I expect service to be spot on. When the cocktails cost more than MANY people make in an hour, I don't find it unreasonable to expect it to arrive in a timely manner and\/or to be comped or at least an apology if was completely forgotten. None of those things happened

"UPDATE:  I was going to let this go but it's just not right for you to make misrepresentations to your customers, especially about serving sizes. Aside from being unethical, many of us rely on that information for dietary purposes etc.

The photos from your own previous yelp reviews clearly show that you have cut your serving sizes in half between March and August based on when the photos in the reviews were taken and posted. Feel free to a look at the photos I have I uploaded for you and others to see. It's obvious what size scoopers you used before and are using now. And neither of them are 1.5 oz as you represent in your response. They WERE 2 oz each, now they ARE 1 oz each., plain and simple. I was there more recently and they were still the 1 oz scoops just like the photos. 

Your response is not only false, it's laughable and an insult to people's intelligence. Let me see if I got this right, you changed your bowl size to make it smaller because they were ""too large"" and had ""empty space""? Seriously? What a joke. Just tell your customers the truth and tell them you lowered your serving sizes from 2 ounces to 1 ounce. Many of your reviews already address this issue so obviously I am not alone.

This was the third stop on my Tour D' Poke. I actually have been here twice and planned to write a review the first time I was here (which would have been a three star review). I found myself in the neighborhood and came back hoping to see an improvement from when they were new. Although the place still looks great and the people were friendly enough, unfortunately the fish is still mediocre at best. Not the level of freshness or sushi grade like some others. The first time I came, which was a couple months after they opened, I asked one of the employees where they buy their fish and after checking, he said ""Restaurant Depot"" which explained the marginal freshness and quality factor. Not saying it's bad, just not five or even four star worthy if you ask me. Also I found the sauce to be a bit bland.

This time around I would say everything was on par with my first visit except they have greatly reduced the serving sizes of the scoops of fish. In fact, I took a photo on my first visit and the serving utensils in the bowls were way different. They used to use what I believe were 2 oz spoons and now they use what appears to be a 1 oz scooper. Interestingly these utensils are color coded by serving size and you can find them easily online at restaurant supply websites. It was easy to research and verify this and I will be considering this information when I evaluate others. So basically they went from 3 stars to 2 because of the much smaller portions (50% of what they used to serve and what others currently serve).

"This buffet has good review and selection among other buffets, so we decided to give it a try. The overall experience should be 3 stars, but I am taking 1 star off because of the price we paid. With the price we paid, we expected a higher quality buffet. We visited this place for brunch during the July 4th week, so the price for lunch is $59.99 + tax + tips (close to $80 per person). During the holiday, the breakfast costs $39.99, brunch costs $59.99, and Dinner costs $69.99. First of all, one of the cashiers ""Grace"" is rude, and there is miscommunication between the cashiers, hosts and kitchen staffs. We arrived around 10am, and we were welcome to look at the food selections before we decided to eat there. One of hosts said there will be more items added to the buffets during lunch hours starting at 11 am. If we go in before 10:30 am, the price would be $39.99. So we decided to get in around 10:25 am to lock in the $39.99 price, the cashier Grace was saying the price should be $59.99 and the price $39.99 ends at 9:30 am, not 10:30 am. When we told her the host told us a different timeline earlier, then Grace responded us with an attitude like we tried to cheat to get in at a lower price. I totally understand if the host provided us the wrong information, but Grace didn't have to explain it in such a rude way. Anyway, we paid $59.99 per person to get in and the host apologized to us regarding the wrong information she provided earlier. Then it comes to advertisement issue... Many items from the brunch holiday menu are missing from the actual buffet selections. If you are going to charge more for the holiday buffet, please commit to what you advertised on the menu. When we complained the missing food items from the menu, they said the menu was wrong. So they removed the menu instead of adding the missing menu items to the buffet for their customer. Since we looked around during breakfast time (for price at $39.99), we know what they have for breakfast. At 11:00 am, nothing much was added to the lunch buffet (at $59.99). So basically, they are charging more with no additional items added to the buffet. Last but not least, the food is just average comparing to a regular buffet, but it is below average comparing to a hotel\/ good restaurant. I am very disappointed with their desserts. I agree they have good selections of different cuisines, but nothing is performing at the best. I ordered a soufflé from the dessert counter, and it is totally taste nothing like soufflé. If you don't tell me it is a soufflé, I would not able to tell. It tastes like a chewy cake or bread? It is a failure for sure. I don't know what is going on with the food quality control at this buffet. If none of your chefs know how to cook a particular dish, please offer something else instead of adding a trash to the food selections.",0.0
Extremely disappointed and over priced! My friends had been to the location in Phoenix and loved it and decided to check out the location in Mesa... big mistake!!! The fish did not taste fresh... food lacked flavor... overall not good quality. I thought ok maybe the spicy tuna roll is simple enough but it looked and tasted like something you would get at a gas station (not that I've ever had it). If you are going to charge a lot for a drink put some liquor in the damn drink. Would not recommend... they need to get better quality fish... hire some people that know how to make sushi... revamp the menu as it took forever to order because nothing stood out as being this sounds amazing. I have no issue spending money on good food but when you're disappointed and then get the high bill... no thanks,0.0
"You couldn't pay me to step a foot into this place again! The rudest, most disrespectful people work at this place.  
Amanda may be the best in this shop, but she needs to lose the arrogance and racism. Snow could also benefit from exposure to other ethnic groups.  

I read the reviews before I made my appointment with this shop 16 days early. I confirmed the day before my appointment, and arrived 10 minutes before my scheduled time.  I had requested a full set with Amanda first, then a pedicure with Snow (all based on the reviews I had read).  From the moment I sat down at her station, Amanda was rude. I told her I would like a full acrylic set with a couple designs on each hand. She told me she needed a picture of what I wanted. I had a few screenshots saved to the phone and showed her. Immediately after that, she talked through me to the receptionist and told her I should get a pedicure first. Mind you, I specifically requested the pedicure last. She refused to do my nails first, so I went back to the couch confused. The receptionist escorted me to the foot spa area while the woman who arrived AFTER me sat down in front of Amanda. They started chatting and laughing while Amanda got to work on her nails.  WTF?  That was my appointment time.

I was pretty upset but didn't say anything. Instead, I sat down and waited for Snow to do my pedicure. I waited for a few minutes and a lady asked if I wanted water. I thanked her and declined. I waited about 10 more minutes before realizing Snow would not be doing my pedicure. Jason, a very nice man, sat down and started with my toes. He was sweet and joked a bit. Midway through the pedicure, Amanda came over to see what type of nails I wanted.  Jason finished and told me Amanda would be by to get me.  .......I sat there for well over 25, getting angrier and angrier by the minute. The shop was not busy by that time. Why was I just sitting around?! To add to my anger, I overheard the receptionist whispering to Snow. ""You tell her"". ""No, you tell her."" ""Just go over and tell her."" ""No."" ""Don't be scared just go over there."" Finally the receptionist came over, apologized for the wait and told me Snow would now be doing my nails.  What?!  I look at her and tell her this level of service was unacceptable. I arrived at 2:20pm and it was already 4pm.  She apologizes again while Snow stood hunched over a few yards away. Seriously, she was going to do my nails? She looked like a terrified child.

The receptionist took my shoes and placed them at Snow's station before I picked them up and told her I would be leaving. I walked to the front, paid for the pedicure, and walked out. I was So infuriated. So disrespected. A COMPLETE waste of my time!  I should've said what I wanted before I left, but I was torn between feeding into a stereotype or calling out such horrific service. So here it is:

Amanda - humble yourself. When you have a paying customer, who made an appointment, honor that. Treat people with respect. If you have an issue with someone based solely on your prejudice, acknowledge it and pass the job to someone else. Don't waste people's time. Remember, you reap what you sow.
Snow - I urge you to spend the day with someone who isn't like you. You may learn some pretty amazing things and get over your bias.
4UrNails - Strive for better customer service. Your receptionist was the ONLY one who was apologetic. If you want to cater to one demographic, that's your business but don't waste my time. You can just say that upfront.

"Because the rating of 3 means ""A-OK"" for yelps rating vs 4 ""yay I'm a fan"" I chose 3 because it was exactly that. The experience was not bad it was just a visit to dentist office and every business has room for improvement so it was A-OK. I went here due to a filling that had fallen out.  As a side note, I believe this is the only places in town, could be wrong, that accepts MEDICAID. I say this because this place may have bad reviews because it being ONE of, if not the only place to accept medicaid in town, it is going to be busy and yes the staff in the back are rushed along with the fact they allow WALK-INS and I think that the front staff may have to deal with a lot of people who give them grief because even while I was sitting, a girl walked in without an appointment and went on complaining about how she had to wait to be seen. So it is a give and take situation from my one experience. THE PROS-  1. The front office staff answered all my questions and 2. were friendly and trust me I had a lot of questions due to reviews I had read. 3. I went in expecting to return a second time to get my filling but it was done right then and there. 4. The assistant was nice and tried to answer my questions about how they sterilize their equipment 5. She even held my hand during the injections. THE CONS- 1. I had a scheduled appointment but still sat and waited about fifty minutes while others who had came in after kept going to the back but the staff did notice that I had been skipped several times and switched me to a different doctor because I was a new client. 2. Apparently, once you are placed with a doctor due to plan of care or continuity of care that is always your doctor so I guess if you didn't like your doctor I'm not sure how you switch. 3. It was a very rushed feeling\/ atmosphere in the back and when looking up the doctors some had only been practicing less than a year which for me personally makes me nervous but it was just a filling. 4. Definitely a language barrier with the tech and the doctor. 5. Due to possible cultural and being a new dentist, the bed side manner was poor. 6. I was not told or walked through what was going to be done and no information about after care was presented and no goodbye until I went up and thanked the doctor.. both were up and gone faster than I could get sitting up in the chair. 7. Also, after I had asked about how long they had been a dentist, I think it offended the doctor...and when I was deciding if I wanted to do the filling, the doc walked over to another doc and spoke in their native language and both looked at me making me aware either they were talking about me or maybe asking advice, but I personally do not like when someone speaks in a language I don't understand because it creates more insecurity for the patient. 8. I'm not a doctor but the first shot given felt as if it went way too far in and when asked if my tongue was numb I said no but my face is (all the way to my ear and scalp) so a second shot was given. OVERALL, like I said, it is a give and take affect here, they offer services other places don't like a child care center, and they accept MEDICAID and they accept walk-ins! To sum it up, healthcare in its entirety is pushing healthcare workers to do more in less time with more expectations.",0.0
"Two weeks ago, Rey and JR at Gateway were able to negotiate a nice interest rate for us on our 2017 malibu. We left the dealership satisfied and happy with our new vehicle. However, we purchased the vehicle at night and did not notice a crack in the windshield until the next morning. Thr remote start key was not working either. We contacted Rey and several sales managers to resolve the issue, with Rey even taking pictures on his phone when we went up to the dealership personally. After no resolution, I called JR this past Tuesday who seems to be an executive at Gateway, and told him the issue. He said that he would speak with Rey and call me back. I never received a reply. The lack of action or resolution once we drove off the lot is the reason why my husband and I decided to review the dealership and the staff at the dealership. Once you are in a vehicle, they do not care anymore. Which is a shame, because we are Chevy people and would have been repeat customers.",0.0
"The atmosphere is calm and serene, the decorations are appropriate, servers are nice and the quality of the food is what you would expect from Wolfgang Puck. The major problem I have here is with using the discount cards that are affiliated with this restaurant and the managerial staff's lack of acknowledgement for such.
 
My wife and I came in to have lunch and ordered from their prix fixe lunch menu. Halfway through our meal, we were told that the 30% off discount we showed our waiter would not apply to that menu since the prices were fixed before. Typically I understand this, but when this is not advertised and is the sole reason why you purchased the card, this mistake should not fall on the cost of the consumer. Technically, this can be classified as entrapment, as we were given no fair warning of a selective discount, and not one single printed advertisement says discounts cannot be applied. 

When speaking with management, we were told they ""don't control what the vendors write"" (even though multiple other restaurants have restrictions printed on the same ad), and ""we need to go to the website for the fine print"" (who does that, and how would we know to do that?) I've done advertising before, I've been in management before- trust me, you've got a lot more control in what's printed because it's technically illegal to have a vendor falsely advertise for you including rearrangement of context and content of advertisements.

This is very unfortunate because the quality of the food we reluctantly paid full price for was excellent, and the staff working there who have no say in the advertising were sublime. I do recommend coming here, but be forewarned if you carry any of the discount cards. My review stands, at least until they can correct their mistake and not blame the consumer for their advertising oversight.",0.0

The guy working the late shift was really slow (did I make that clear yet?) and unhelpful\/unhappy and didn't warm things up right and put barely any stuff on our sandwich.

Usually you can count on Mexican restaurants to have vegan dishes and they made it easier to find those items with a green ""V"" next to them and a note at the bottom of the menu that those items could be made Vegan or vegetarian.  However, I was disappointed that the menu had the corn tamales listed with one of these V's, but when I asked the waitress to order it without cheese she replied that this could not be done.  I ended up ordering a pinto bean burrito which was not on the menu, but was very good.  I did have to eat it with a fork though as it was quite runny.

"I'm re-reviewing Hakkasan, because yelp removed my last review, for no fair reason.  

My wife and I went here last year, and we had a GREAT time inside the club!

Why the one-star review? 

Because the security people who run the line are both CLUELESS\/DUMB, as WELL as mean\/brutal.

Personally, we didn't have a problem.  But, the two parties around us (one was foreign, and didn't know English well -- the other person was a bit drunk) got HARASSED and kicked around like trash.  Brutal!    I don't approve, because:  1) Foreign (non-English speaking) -- cut them a break, for crying out loud!  Just because they don't know every rule in the book doesn't mean to yell them and them and then brutalize them because they can't understand your aggressive & fast English!  2) Drunk person -- was honestly just clueless, and needed a little guiding.  NOT aggressive or a jerk.  But they took advantage of this person to brutalize him and kick him around like trash.

Again, we had smooth sailing, and we kept our mouths shut.... we had a great time inside, and saw Kaskade.

They deserve no more than 1 star for their treatment of people (aka abuse by security\/bouncers, etc. who have VERY low self esteem, and are NOT smart people -- at least the ones we saw when we were there).

The pricing on dim sum is outrageously expensive. Food is terrible, full of lard and MSG. Chicken Paw was a frozen dish regurgitated - fridge odor was present.

We had the following:

Steam Pork Bun - B+ 
Baked Pork Bun - D.  Good flavor, full of lard though.
Shrimp Har Gow - D. Have never seen Har Gow that huge. Some pork fat was in the Har Gow.

With tea at $2 a person, and the charge on the condiments, total bill came up to over $60 without sales tax and gratuities. Even with a 25% discount for local residents, it is close to $60 for 2 of us.  With the food quality the way it is, definitely not worth the experience.

The concept sounded ok but when we went it was nearly deserted, save for a table that was given VIP service at the back.  It emptyness of the restaurant gave an uncomfortable vibe.

Anyways, the menu states that the signature cheese ribs has a minimum 2 order.  This stipulation meant that we were limited to just ordering that.  It was later on when another table came in that a customer inquired and the server said you could order one order of the cheese ribs but that it wouldn't be very much.  Well, it would've been nice to be given that option!

The presentation was nice, you get a large plate that has the cheese and corn, then the ribs on top.  The side dishes were small and not enough for two.  Imagine a spoonful of mashed potatoes spread thin, that's what we got.

The sides were: boiled sliced carrots, mashed potatoes, mashed sweet potatoes, corn and one egg.  While the serving of cheese and corn (mixed in) was good for two, the other sides were very small.  

Each serving had 4 ribs which were alright but expensive for what we got.  There was one male server with glasses, he was pleasant and helpful.  

I got annoyed that the neighbouring table was checked and asked frequently how they were enjoying their meal and feedback was given.  We weren't asked how our meal was until the end.  Oh yeah, that table that the server was keen to speak with to get feedback, they got free desserts as compensation for their feedback and she was unhappy with her meal.

"Hot Star is a unique spot in Downtown Toronto that is offering Taiwanese Chicken. Now, there are plenty of Taiwanese places, especially in the GTA Markham area, but this is probably one of the few in the downtown core. What makes this place a bit more unique is this flattened bone in chicken breast that they have.

We tried one of those with the original batter and seasoning. Also had a popcorn chicken too because it looked so good. The chicken breast was pretty good and meaty, despite how flat it was. I thought it would be like a German Schnitzel, but was thicker than that. The spices used were good and had a nice kick. The bone is still attached so just be aware of that when you are biting into one end.

The popcorn chicken tasted fine, but portion was also small. For the price, you'd expect a bit more. The chicken pieces were good. Batter is light like the chicken breast, but tiny pieces. 

Though the chicken tasted pretty decent, the price is high. The breast is large, but that is also due in part to it being flattened. $10 for one breast is too much for me.

Mind you, the place was not busy at all. I had to get up and ask for it. She brings it over.  Another 5 minutes later she continues to ignore us. I was even looking around, clearly ready to pay. She still doesn't come over. I get up and hand her the bill and our cards asking her to split it. She mumbles okay and walks off. 

At that point I was done. I didn't tip them and I ALWAYS tip but this has to be the worst customer service I have had in a very long time. I'll take my business elsewhere. By the looks of it this place has pretty awful reviews on their bad service yet they continue to do nothing? Not okay. I won't be returning to tea station.",0.0
"I don't think Andy would think much of this museum. It presents itself as an educational experience, but it plays too much to an audience that knows nothing about Warhol or how printing works. 

The collection itself is mediocre and really just scratches the surface, playing safe and family friendly at every turn. I've seen some of the editions on display for sale on eBay. Looking through the catalog raisonne is more interesting. 

There are a lot of movies and videos to watch, and I could have spent hours watching them if you aren't forced to perch on a backless stool with the screen at a headache inducing distance. Blow Job is tucked into a corner and not given the space it deserves.

"This was the second food tour we did, our first with this group. Our guide, Joe, met us at the Valley Ho Hotel and after a short intro about the tour and the hotel, we were on our way. The first stop was just a short walk from the hotel. We were given two types of pizza and also a beer here. The owner came out and told us about both items. The crust was thin and the sauce was very good. The beer was from a local brewery. It had a good taste and not a lot of hops. The last stop was a restaurant where we received two chicken wings, bananas foster and a drink. The wings were spiced just right, the dessert was sweet and mixed well with the ice cream. The drink did not seem to have any alcohol in it, even though the server said it was a vodka\/soda mix. In between there was a trolley ride, as well as some other places we visited, however, they were not to our liking. Our guide answered any questions the group had for him, but did not seem to have a lot of knowledge about the area or its history. He was not bad, just very basic. We were hoping for more. Over all we would give this tour a solid C. It could have been so much more, but just not what we were hoping for.",0.0
"I have been to this restaurant before, usually the food is normally good, but the service was very poor this time around. The waiter asked me for more tip because I didn't give ""their"" minimum amount even though I had paid for three people.

"Not exactly the experience I was hoping for.  It was later in the evening on a Sunday.  The staff seemed a little busy or overwhelmed for some reason, although it wasn't really that busy.  I waited for awhile to get my order in.  I sampled the mac & cheese before deciding what sides to order and it is very creamy, not baked.  I decided against it and got the pulled pork sandwich, baked beans, gumbo, and corn pudding.  Now mind you, I have been to a YELP event at their first location & was pretty satisfied with most of the stuff.  They were out of collards, sad.  So let's give the run down: baked beans were not good.  It seemed like they sat in a thick, sweet paste all day and we got bottom of the barrel? I don't know, but not what I remember.  Gumbo: horrible...the rice was hard & sticky, there was no sausage in mine, and the flavor was disappointing.  Corn pudding: good, exactly how I remember it.  I tried my friend's okra: horrible!!!!! What the heck??? I don't understand what went wrong tonight. I enjoyed my corn pudding and my pulled pork sandwich with the sweeter sauce and an orange sauce (forget the name).

A few managers came out and took away our gumbo. They checked back on us and even brought us dessert to make up for some things.  They were both really nice and I was thankful they helped us out.  I just don't get what happened with the food, because I remember loving a lot of it at the Ballantyne location on YELP event night. The staff was unorganized and not paying attention or busy with something..I'm just not sure what.

"Don't buy here if there's a chance you will need to return or exchange something. To start off, my 13 year old daughter and her grandmother (my mother) came into this store Sunday, November 19th. The store was getting close to closing, but they were allowed to shop and purchase their items. My daughter asked if she could try her items on, but she was told the fitting room was closed, and she would need to check out. The next day, she tried on her items, and one pair of pants she purchased did not fit properly. I told her to put the pants back in the bag, with the receipt and we will exchange them. They literally sat in my closet the entire time. We came in last night(within the normal 14 day exchange policy) and the store did not carry the next size up pants, so she chose other items to purchase. When we were ready to exchange the pants (and purchase additional items), we were asked where the tag was that came on the pants. There were multiple other manufacture tags on the pants, I did not notice the tag with the sku number was missing. My daughter said she did not remove any tags on her own, and she was unsure where the tag was either. The cashier went to speak to her manager (I assume) Sammy. Sammy came up to the register, did not even greet us and speak kindly of their policies about missing tags, she abruptly blurted out ""How can I exchange these pants without the tag?!"" I explained we did not remove any tags. Could it have possibly fell off or maybe the pants were sold to her without the tag? Who knows. I told her the exact same pants are on the wall, if she could please just use that tag to scan and do the exchange. (As I said earlier, all other tags were still on the pants, this was the only missing tag). Sammy started rudely saying, ""What is all this white stuff on here?"" Then she started lint rolling the pants with tape. The pants were black with white LINT. They were in perfect condition! She looked at the pants up and down over and over, as if trying to find a reason to tell me she couldn't do the exchange. She said she can do the exchange this one time. The cashier gave us all purchased items in a bag, without a receipt. I asked for the receipt, then she printed it, with FINAL SALE on it even for the new items we had just purchased. I asked why does this say final sale? Sammy told me because I returned an item without a tag. I asked what about the 3 other items I JUST bought? She told me it's all final sale because the pants I returned have pet hair and a stain. I told her that was impossible and to show me the stain. She was not able to point out the stain, but pointed out the WRINKLE on the pants that sits behind the knee saying it was worn. I told her it was not worn, if it was, why would all the other tags still be on the pants? I said she tried it on, so its not our fault if the pants have a small wrinkle, that to me is insane to even point that out!  She said it was her store policy and I could not get a normal receipt for the new items. I took her name and told her I was contacting corporate. This is terrible customer service and being accused of being dishonest. They will never get my business again.",0.0

"Eddie was a great help and was very accommodating. However.. This location suffers particularly from a lack of organization and honesty. 

Multiple occasions i have been here only to have the technicians obliviously lie straight to my face! Claiming that I needed unnecessary repairs.. 


On my most recent visit 10\/9\/17, it took them 3 1\/2 hours to fulfill a basic oil change. Three and a half hours.  All the while, other customers were coming in and out as per usual. After 2 hours, the employee gruntly advised me to stand outside and wait for them, ""they would be finished shortly"". Standing outside, I observed the absence of a sense of urgency. The technicians monotonously grudge around, slowly carrying out their orders until every order is finished (except mine). I observed a group of 6 technicians mostly standing around in a semi-circle,  loudly cursing profanity and  racial slurs. 

Be careful, they will purposely dodge and try to squeeze a dime out of your penny, all while smiling to your face with a blatant lie.

"For starters, I hate katsu and I am not a fan of it at all. However, my friends wanted to go there and I figured I'd might as well work with something new. We came in right before the dinner rush and was seated within 5 minutes. We were given menus to look over and they did not ask us for our drinks until 10 minutes after seating. They didn't take our order until 25 minutes after being seated. It was frustrating because like I have mentioned, I hate katsu and having to wait for almost half an hour wasn't giving me a good impression to want to eat at this place. The dinning area was full I understand and there were two of the servers walking around. 

After just waving one of them down we ordered our food. I ordered their ""Tori Katsu & Ebi Fry"" and my fiancè got the ""Rosu Katsu Curry."" Looking at the menu your food comes with white rice, miso soup, and a type of pickled veggie on the side. They set it up on a serving platter for each plate and they do have good presentation. My friends ordered the Rosu Katsu as well and had some sides with it. There's a Yelp check-in where you obtain a free Potato salad. All four of us were yelpers and found this place from Yelp (of course), and when we wanted to redeem each check-in for ourselves our guy server said we could only use one. I understand there's a limitation BUT do not offer a check-in incentive to people if it'll be one per table, keep in mind that your business attracts a lot of yelpers so I hope they accommodate in the future! It was our first time here and we chose this business because Yelp suggested you so it would have been great to experience an individual bowl of potato salad. We split that bowl between us 4, literally one bite. It was good and I wish we individually got to experience our own bowls so we could all equally enjoy the food. 

Anyways, that issue aside we waited for another 20 minutes for our food. I don't know what was going on? Short staff or lack of urgency? Because our guy server wasn't up to par with us, barely served us and we sat at the front but the lady server was hustling. She ended up checking up on us more than he did (thank you!) Katsu was delicious, this place did turn me into a katsu lover to be honest. Their miso soup was just as good and perfect to start or end your meal. During our dining experience there was also flies flying around. It was an annoyance, couldn't enjoy my katsu without tryna slap the air. Lol towards the ending the lady server served us more than our original server and she was such a sweetheart! We came in around 7:30pm and left a little before closing so that's an idea as to how long it took for us to wait for our original server to get or drinks\/ orders, to deliver our food, and give us the bill. I could have came on an off day but the lady server was busting her butt ensuring we left satisfied so there should never be an excuse as to why the first server's customer service\/ urgency wasn't good. 

For the two plates my fiancè and I ordered cost about $33 with tax. It's bittersweet. The food is delicious and our second lady server was awesome. However, it just bothers me how they have the check-in offer and limits it to one table, their wait time is pretty long, and their other server wasn't up to par.",0.0

"Really, really not impressed with this place. Prices are unbelievably high and the portions are occasionally laughable. There was nothing especially wrong with my meal - it tasted fine and was priced okay. But everything else was not.

REALLY?) and the ""cheese plate"" which seemed expensive at first was an enormous disappointment with two plops of cheese on the plate with barely anything to surround it.

"Update:  Tennis- I've been a member now for 6 months. The head pro still does not acknowledge me in the very small club. Does not even try to know my name. Did not receive a welcome phone call or 1\/2 hour hitting drill. I personally had to try to help a new player get on the courts.  She could not find anyone to play with. Haven't seen her since. 

On the other hand, I would recommend Stuart for clinics and lessons. He is very professional and cares about his clients. He is the one person who called to try to get me on a team. I am a solid 3.5 player. Have played for many years at clubs in northern Ca. Never had this experience.

I hope that things change here..This club has great potential..a lot of great people here..This club can turn it around by just reaching out to new members and making everyone feel welcome.",0.0

"This grocery is an ok place to shop. I can say that I am at the grocery store a lot during the week so I have some pretty high standards when it comes to shopping at them. I do give them praise for their selection and price. I always know that if I want great organic food, this is the place if Festival Foods doesn't have it. This store is very big so they have all different cuisines and variety throughout the store. Their liquor department is very big with a ton of options. Their prices are a bit cheaper on things compared to Metcalf's and other high end grocery stores. 

The few downsides to this store are the parking lot, the tiled floor and the very slow checkout lanes. The parking lot is gigantic but the lanes are very small and people are constantly flying through the lot. There are many other businesses around it as well so it makes it very congested most of the day. 

I know complaining about the tile on the floor is reaching for a complaint for some but this is literally the loudest store. I get a headache every time I go in. The carts rumbling makes everyone have to scream over each other to hear, which then makes it very loud. You would think that just a few sections would be tiled, but it is the whole store from what I can tell. If you have glass bottles in your cart make sure to hold onto them or they fall and bounce around while walking through this store. 

The checkout has gotten a bit better because of them installing a lot more self checkout lanes and the new electronic scanning machines. I usually plan about an hour and a half or more for my whole trip considering the checkout area is always very busy. The checkout employees are usually quiet and never say much. 

When it comes to customer service I have never been greatly impacted by an employee being great. When I have trouble finding something I always try and ask before roaming the whole store wondering where something is located. When I ask an employee they usually either say they do not know or they will point me in a direction and let me fend for myself. On multiple occasions I have roamed the store after asking an associate and have been upset because I couldn't find the item I was looking for. Overall I would avoid this store if you are on a tight schedule or do not want the headache of the mad rush of people. There are a lot of better options when it comes to grocery stores in my opinion.",0.0
Absolutely terrible customer service. Ordered online 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive my items. Called online customer service and mailbox is full.

"What a terrible experience. The hard palate in my mouth broke a couple of weeks ago...I was sent to their ER by Abrazo in Scottsdale because Abrazo has no oral-maxillary-facial surgeon on staff and that was who I needed to see.We went in to an ER only because this happened due to an error by an oral surgeon on ""the outside"" and I have been to many, many oral surgeons with the result that they will not get involved. The original one has vigorously denied anything happened other than a routine extraction and finally refused to see me anymore (but when you are having brackets and pins fall out, it is obvious it was not routine) The physician at Abrazo said the same thing ""Since this was another surgeon's work, you will not find another surgeon in the city that will touch it...your only hope is to go through the hospital system,"" and this is when he suggested ""Good Sam"".

So I get there, and the wait time was quite short, but that was the only good part. I went into a ""cubicle"" and a PA comes in, is quite impatient during the history taking, leaves about three times during it, and the fourth time does not even finish a health history or anything before putting on a glove, running a finger across the top of my mouth, and announcing ""Your palate is not broken. Go home."" I was upset to the point of tearful at this point, because she had not gotten anywhere near the site, and I begged her to feel again and let me show her where. She stated no, as she had already removed her glove, and left the room. The nurse showed up with discharge papers before registration got there. The nurse was giving me discharge papers as registration came in. I stated I would not register until I received treatment. That as a nurse, I know what an assessment is, and that was not an assessment. If I was not going to receive assessment or treatment, there was no point in registering. I asked her and the discharge to please ask the PA to come back. On the way out, I heard her loudly announce ""I am just going to write refused"". The discharge nurse then left, and returned with a security guard! The nurse said he had written refused to the discharge instructions too, and now I was being asked to leave or Phoenix PD would be called and I would be charged with trespassing! Not once did I become physically unruly or even raise my voice more than just enough to be assertive that I wanted an actual assessment if I was going to be billed for one. So I was shocked that now that this security guard was escorting us off the property.

It gets even better though... Because of a low blood pressure issue that ironically gets worse when I am upset, while we were being walked through the parking garage I passed out and fell. I told them I was fine and just wanted to leave, but now that liability was involved they were all concern. Putting me on a backboard and all. Then they of course did scans of my head, the whole workup. 

So bottom line, if you have a medical problem that needs assessed, at least with that one PA, it is probably not going to happen. But fall on their property and you'll get all the attention in the world...just not for your medical problem.",0.0

Not to mention she stated to me after I apologized if I seemed flustered as I just got off a flight...she stated...I swear to you...""yeah well it's been a long day for me too, I don't know what you want me to tell you."") to check-out (where I had numerous incorrect charges on my bill...I asked to speak to a manager not once...not twice...but three times to no avail or call back as promised...). I at one point was actually screaming to speak to a manager. I was told my card would not be charged (it was), I was told that a manager would call me (they didn't).

"Let me start off by saying I have been to multiple bridal salons at this point and not one of them has been like azteca. I dont even know where to begin with this horrible and discouraging experience but I'll start with when you first walk in. If you plan to shop at azteca bridal don't even worry about your appointment time because they will get to you when they feel like it. O and definitely don't expect a greeting when you walk in the door because apparently they are too busy for that too. Eventually you will be taken upstairs by someone and they will let you sift through all the dresses on your own because they are over booked and don't have time for you. The girl who brought us upstairs was originally working at the front desk. She told us that she would help is get some dresses to my dressing room and then my stylist would be with me shortly. Of course my stylist never showed up! So I have some girl from the front desk helping me try on dresses and regardless if this was her job or not I will say that she was very sweet and helpful. So fast forward a bit, we have now tried on several dresses with my non stylist and are ready to go look for more. The lady said she would go look for a dress I wanted to try on and I could go pick some more. So my friends and I are walking around and have two dresses in hand. Some nice gentleman asked if he could take the dresses for us so we didn't have to carry them around. Well right after he took the dresses from me a short Hispanic lady walks over and starts yelling at us and the guy helping us. ""No more dresses! No more!"" ""No mas! No mas!"" My friends and I were so confused what was going on because we were told we could go get more. Well then they lady who was suppose to be my stylist but never showed up finally comes over to tell us our appointment was over and she already gave our dressing room away. She took our dresses out and gave our dressing room away without saying a word to us! No warning about our time coming to  an end they just kicked us ouy. At this point we are all completely dumbfounded and dont even know what to say. Well the sweet girl who had been helping us the whole time offered to take us to a back dressing room to try on the last two dresses. After we tried those on we were getting ready to leave when I asked the girl if she could just show me a dress. Not try it on, just show me because the dress was too small for me anyways. The girl was very sweet and said yes but before she could show us she had to take a phone call. She started to be reprimanded on the phone for basically not kicking us out like the other two ladies. Even after she got in trouble on the phone she still offered to show me that last dress and I just told her to forget it. She apologized and walked us downstairs. I can honestly say I will never return to this shop and I will tell everyone I know to not spend their money here. I have never been treated so poorly, I don't understand how they are still in business. I didn't even go over the fact that they only have every dress in one size so you can't even try on half of them. If you want a really awful bridal experience where you are treated like trash, this is the place for you.",0.0

The owners are still the same, and yes, most of the time going to the present, I am questioning how they can be so rude with an attitude that we are being a pain in their butt by placing an order and we should be somehow privileged they are allowing us to eat their food.

Now, the wait staff is a different story. They are always polite and courteous. They just do not apparentely get what their duties are as a waitress. Do I wish when there are only 4 customers in the restaurant with just as many waitresses, they spend a bit of time to at least attempt to fill my coffee cup more then once? Yes, absolutely. If im eating breakfast, I want coffee.Eating eggs over medium, bacon, sausage, grits, hashbrowns, toast and etc, all of the above loses its luster if my coffee cup is empty. It is a good breakfast for the money, not as good as others, but still good for the $$'s and they serve breakfast til 4pm, I think.

My last visit 1 week ago today at approx 1pm. I was 1 of 2 tables. There were no other customers. Plenty of waitresses, all debating who was leaving at what time since it was 1pm and obviously any rush they had was over so they were all sitting near the other customer(s) table who were obviously regulars discussing this while chatting with the folks at the other table.. With my  coffee cup empty, I stopped eating thinking it cant be long til they 'check on me and refill my coffee cup'. I even made it clear when I stopped eating that I was looking around trying to get somebodies attention. When another waitress, sitting next to mine chatting with the other customer, looked at me I immediately held up my coffee cup and pointed at at. She then informed my waitress who immediately looked over and said ""i'll be right there"".

She didnt come! I finished my breakfast with no coffee, no water. When she came over to leave my bill on the table a short while later, she looked at the empty coffee cup and empty water glass and didnt say a single word. 

OK, the food. While not even close to similar diners, in fact not even in the same ballpark, the food is what it is. The basics and affordable. Nothing more. I will say with breakfast, it comes out great everytime. Eggs cooked exactly as ordered every time. Decent bacon, sausage, livermush, grits hashbrowns, fresh toast etc....

Lunch, again, always decent for the money, you likely will not leave disappointed or still hungry while at the same time you will not be rushing out telling others 'oh my, this place is terrific...go there, you'll love it'.

There are quite a few similar places you actually would leave so satisfied that you want to eagerly tell others.

Liberty east is not in that category. They are in the category of affordable diners you likely wont get sick\/food poisoning after eating and will leave satisfied and full belly.

Nothing too great, but nothing to awful. Your basic diner which will satisfy most. 

I'll be back. I have other diners I eat at that are so much better its absurd to compare, but sometimes where you are and your schedule\/timeframe dictates where you eat, and while many are far better, I have no qualms with continuing to eat there if that is what my schedule dictates. I know I'll leave with a full belly, and while not jumping for joy wanting to tell others, I also wont be complaining & telling others to stay away.

So give it a shot. If your expectations are reasonable, you should leave satisfied with a full belly, which is what a dinner like this is good for\/intended for.

I do know next time im there for breakfast, Im simply going to tell them to fill up a carafe with coffee and leave it on my table, which should make their job easier and I'll have enough coffee to get me thru the meal.

Likely 3 stars, but im giving it 2, not because my coffee cup remained empty, but because they had more waitresses then customers all laughing it up and even after getting there attention, I still did not get a refill on coffee or water, which when delivering my bill, she clearly saw and didnt even say a word.

Enjoy it for what it is. Good, nothing outstanding, but decent, filling and affordable.",0.0

RealAZBBQ.com Review
Last Updated: August 1, 2016 When owner Patrick Frederick opened Danky's BBQ in North Phoenix in 2015 next to a PetsMart off of Tatum and Bell, it was easily dismissed as just another pop-up BBQ restaurant riding on the rising BBQ wagon.
Just this past month, Phoenix Magazine's 2016 BBQ and Summer Food Guide ranked Danky's as the third best BBQ spot overall in Phoenix, behind Bryan's Black Mountain BBQ in Cave Creek and Little Miss BBQ in Central Phoenix. Danky's also ranked second in brisket and ""second to none"" for their BBQ beans.
Their large menu hangs on the wall just above what looks like to be about a quarter cord of seasoned mesquite wood. The commercial Cadillac Cooker is due right and the rotisserie slowly makes its rounds, carrying foil-wrapped pork ribs, shoulders and briskets.
Ordering is a tough decision. A selection of 7 signature sandwiches appears tempting, as does the smoked fried chicken drums.
I opt for the 1\/4 slab rib dinner with two meats - brisket and andouille sausage with fried okra and mac and cheese on the side. For $19, it's not a bad deal for three meats.
dankys-bbq
Danky's rib plate with brisket and sausage.
As I waited for my tray of meatasticness to be served, I observed some oddities around the restaurant. A deep fryer that had seen better (and cleaner) days, tomorrow's dry rubbed briskets being pushed on a small cart over to the smoker, only for the seasoning to be rubbed off as it came in contact along the short wall that divides the kitchen from the dining area.
Real Arizona BBQ doesn't critique customer service, decorum, flare, or whatever else you think is important. The Maricopa County Department of Public Health doesn't pay my mortgage and I'm not an inspector, so there's not much that bothers me in a restaurant unless it makes me ill afterward. Real Arizona BBQ focuses on what's important - the smoked meats.
Unfortunately, the highly touted Danky's BBQ came in well below par for Arizona BBQ and restaurant-quality food in general. Hence, why you cannot trust Yelp ratings and reviews provided by journalists who haven't yet developed a well-seasoned palate for BBQ.

I witnessed the andouille sausage being sliced and warmed on a gas-fueled stove in a cast iron pan. While great sausage is a rarity in most BBQ establishments, and house-made sausage even more so, this is the first time I've come across pan-fried, charred and crispy sausage.
dankys-sausage
The pork ribs looked promising, although they must have come off of an anorexic pig as the bones were approximately the same size as one's pinky finger. The pork easily separated from the bone, overly tender, as if they had been wrapped in foil for too long. They were indeed moist, the sauce added a slight kick to them but overpowered the pork flavor and any remnants of the rub.

The randomly sized dollops of brisket showed no signs of smoke or seasonings, which was odd as the briskets heading to the smoker were seasoned with a redish hue to them. Most of the bark was missing, also likely due to being held in foil for too long and a careless cutter destroying the hours put into the briskets to create such a bark. Soft and mushy in some pieces, tough and chewy and others, my taste buds were in a whirlwind of confusion.

The fried okra was about what you'd expect and the mac and cheese was runny and made me wishing I was back at Pork on a Fork (their mac is truly second to none).

It's possible my visit to Danky's BBQ took place on an off-day. Every pitmaster and BBQ restaurant has them and they can be excusable. However, when your smoker runs on gas and electricity and you have a reputation to earn, there's no resting on your laurels.

I left with a slight nod of my head and a ""thank you"" to the courteous Danky's staff - I had a Alka-Seltzer cocktail waiting for me at home.

August 1, 2016 UPDATE: The owner of Danky's, Pat, called me a few days after his review was posted to take full responsibility for my visit and apologized for it not meeting his, or my standards. It had appeared that I visited Danky's on the worst week imaginable, one where he was experiencing the perfect storm of staffing, meat supplier and smoker woes that turned the restaurant on its head for almost a week. He noted he was working on improving a few of his sides, introducing new menu items and making his own sausage in-house. He was genuinely concerned about my visit and stated he was dedicated to consistency with the increasing demand of his barbecue.",0.0
"We will never return to this place!!  Food is cold, although the service is pretty good.  We went there today because they started a weekday buffet. It's not worth  $7.99!

We have been there several times for the Sunday brunch which is better but still not nothing special! I had purchased the Groupon to use for that.  I read every word to make sure there were no exclusions but when I tried to redeem it I  was informed it does not apply to Sunday brunch.  Don't buy their Groupons!

The first time I went it was during their soft opening so the oyster bar wasn't available yet. We ordered the oyster sliders, lobster roll, and two pounds of shrimp. The quality is better than other seafood places and their oyster sliders were amazing! 

The second time I went, it was very busy and we waited for almost 40 min just to seat 2 people. I called earlier to reserve but they said you wouldn't need to reserve, so make sure to reserve just incase! Or call before you leave to make sure it's not busy. When we got seated, it took them awhile to serve us and take our order and then they lost our order as well. We didn't see our waitress for awhile and had to make other employers find her for us. This time around we were able to try their oysters and I was not overly amazed with them either.

Wow is all I can say. We have visited MGM the last few years and it seems like it's gone downhill. We started out with a room that had a broken handle for the shower.  The following night the faucet leaked. Maintenance couldn't fix it so we left it broken until we checked out. MGM didn't even take care of  the room but ended up giving us a credit for food to go back to. Really ? You would think they would like us to leave happy. Is this the way to keep us happy and coming back?,0.0

We stopped in after a local event and wanted to enjoy some wine and pizza.  We first asked for a margherita pizza but then changed our order to pepperoni.  What we received was a plain cheese pizza with no flavor whatsoever.  When I asked about the pizza, our server told us that was their margherita pizza.  I first reminded her that we changed our order to pepperoni but then I went on to explain that we only got a cheese pizza.  She tried to tell me that's how they make margherita pizzas in Italy.  Umm...no it's not.  She did take the pizza off the bill so that was a plus; however, the bill was still extremely high. I've never seen house wine cost that much but whatever.  Service wasn't great.

"Perhaps my rating would be higher if I was not a vegetarian, but unfortunately, UMAI's target customer is not a veghead like me. It was a challenge to find anything that did not contain fish sauce - literally everything from their soups to noodle dishes - so beware my fellow vegetarians!

For my appetizer (which is FREE if you check in on Facebook), I had the vegetable robatayaki  (without their fish tainted sauce). Not something I would recommend. I also ordered their veggie roll which was average quality. Not much you can say about vegetables wrapped in rice.

The only entrees that could be made vegetarian are the curries, so that was my choice by default. I went with the green curry with tofu as recommended by the waitress (who was phenomenal, by the way). My mouth was on FIRE guys! I am the absolute worst when it comes to spicy foods, so I let the waitress know that they need to tone it down a little - okay, maybe a lot. Their only solution was to water it down with coconut milk which just made it flavorless yet somehow still burning hot - the complete opposite of what I was going for. Go figure. 

I am obsessed with green tea flavored anything, so I was beyond excited when it came time for dessert. They ran out of the green tea ice cream but I was able to snag some green tea cheesecake which, to my dismay, tasted nothing like green tea. It was still delicious because, well, it's cheesecake.

I had the strawberry avocado salad for $12. This salad is literally spinach, 6 slices of red onion, a tiny bit of feta cheese, half an avocado and maybe 5\/6 slices strawberries. Way overpriced. I have no issue paying $15 for a properly made, creative, bountiful salad. 

My husband got the side salad (which is the Haymaker salad- mixed greens, tomato, croutons,feta) with cup of soup -chicken tortilla. This was $8 so a bit more reasonable.

On my way back in Luis kept talking crazy, so my husband ask Luis to speak to a supervisor. This floor monitor walk up and said yes Luis is right, you can't take the Scooters out.

But it was ok for you and Luis to be disrespectful,   and not apologize. Yes they were being racist, and that's why I called her out her name. She was worried about her scooter, not about the respect of her customers. My husband is a calm man. So I called her out her name to see if she wanted a response of acknowledgement of wrong doing.

"My last review was a while back, but I've been frequenting this place more as of late, so my impressions of it have definitely changed! The buffet food is pretty much the same as it was all this time, but it's still an okay deal considering the selection. I still think most of it is of questionable quality, stir-fried with lots of grease and sodium, but that's what you'd expect. The everyday items are nothing to write home about (General Tso, Hunan pork\/chicken, beef broccoli, etc.), but they usually have a couple items that are more ""authentic"" and rotate daily. These vary from fried fish to soft scrambled eggs to Cantonese bbq pork or soy sauce chicken. Again, not the best you'll find anywhere, but decent considering the lack of Cantonese food in Pittsburgh.

We've also experimented ordering from the regular menu, with mixed results. Many of their items are surprisingly Cantonese and affordable. Things like wonton noodle soup (Chinese wonton, which is quite different from the Americanized version), beef brisket, and bbq meat noodle and rice plates are all offered. The wonton noodles were surprisingly good, with the skin quite thin and the stuffing very savory--might it even be homemade? The beef brisket noodles were mediocre at best; savory broth, but very tough meat. So there'll probably be more experimenting to do in future visits.",0.0

I have been using Wave House Cleaning since March 2015 to clean my two-story, two-bedroom townhome.  I rent it out for short-term rentals, so I need services similar to those provided by typical cleaning staff at hotels or resorts.  Nothing too fancy, just take the dirty bed sheets off, do the laundry (i.e. dirty towels and bed sheets), make the beds with clean sheets, vacuum, wipe countertops and tables down, clean the bathrooms, etc.

Their scheduling is fairly quick and easy.  I most-often schedule cleanings via e-mail, sending an e-mail with a list of dates and times that I need cleanings for and then corresponding back and forth to nail down the dates and times.

Their prices are fair, so I am not complaining about the fees that they charge.  Reasonable fees... and if I ask for extra services, then I get charged a little extra.

However, I have now experienced issues on four separate occasions.

Around a year ago, I received a message from a guest checking in to tell me that the beds were not made and the towels were dirty in a pile on the floor.  Apparently, the cleaner forgot to wash the bed sheets and towels and to make the beds with clean sheets.  That guest left and headed to another place for their visit to Phoenix.  Doing the right thing, I refunded that guest their entire rental fee.

About three months ago, I received a call from Wave during my scheduled cleaning.  I keep a key available for them in a lockbox.  Apparently, the cleaner could not open the lockbox.  Shortly after that, the cleaner left because ""she could not get the lockbox open"", I went and checked to see if the lockbox opened with the code I provided.  It opened easily on the first try.  There is no trick to opening it... you don't have to jiggle it or shake it or get the numbers just right.  Just enter the code and the box opens.  I tried it again.  Yep, it opened.  My guess is that cleaner just did not feel like working that day. 

About a month ago, no one showed up at all.  Imagine my surprise when a guest checking in called me to tell me that the house was dirty and the beds looked slept in and food and garbage was out on the countertops.  Of course, I also lost that guest and the rental revenue I would have received from them.

The last straw was over this past New Year's weekend.  My guest checking in on December 30th called me at 6pm to tell me that the beds were not made and there was a pile of dirty laundry on the floor.  I tried contacting Wave with the hope that they would send someone back out to finish the job.  I called, e-mailed, and filled out a form on their webpage.  I did not receive any response from Wave until the next day.  My guest was long gone by then along with his rental fee for that long weekend. 

Overall, Wave House Cleaning's cleaners (and\/or computer system) have cost me more than $2,000 in lost rental revenue.  I simply cannot afford to keep using them and relying on them.

While I considered giving Wave two stars since most of the time they have been quick to respond and try to make things right, I just cannot bring myself to do it.  However, in fairness to them, I will say that when they pulled the no-show, they offered my next cleaning for free.  And when their cleaner decided to take the day off, they offered me half off my next cleaning.  

With that said, I would not recommend using Wave if you need someone to reliably show up at a specific time.  I also would not recommend them if you cannot be there to check their work.  I personally will never use Wave House Cleaning again.

"Hmm, mixed emotions about my visit. I will say the highlight was the chimichurri. I could put that on EVERYTHING! And the beer, they get points for that too. Not to mention the service was excellent. Perhaps I'm just not used to this type of food, whatever the case, it wasn't my cup of tea. 

The second you walk in you'll notice it's a no frills joint with this huge deli case (which I didn't expect to see) front and center taking up most of the restaurant. And even more strange the raw meat & ready made items in the same case. At this point I was just hoping I didn't leave with a terrible stomach ache. Somehow I managed to leave unscathed. 

The empanadas were tasty but lacked that flaky texture you'd expect from freshly made empanadas. We ordered the Parillada Argentina. Although sweetbreads aren't my thing, I was told they were very tasty. I tried it by mistake thinking it was chicken. One and done. That was enough for me. Doubt I'll ever be a fan of sweetbreads. The filet mignon was a tad overcooked. I had asked for medium, but it was definitely well-done. The outside was pretty rough and took some effort to cut with my steak knife. It did have a great flavor though so that could've been easily fixed. 

All in all, glad I ventured out to try something new. Love the mom & pop\/family owned restaurant vibe here which is rare in this city.
And the fact that they had an actual changing table in the restroom, not that bulky plastic one you see everywhere else, made it feel like home or visiting relatives. Probably won't be back but glad to check another bookmark off my list.",0.0

"Very disappointing, almost nothing about this visit, for lunch yesterday, was right.  The check-in margarita was very good, then it was all downhill.  The $10 Daddy Margarita was in a glass which was 1 in thick and packed with ice.  It, literally, had 4 sips of liquid total, so $2.50\/sip.  The place filled up as we ate lunch, and they were way understaffed.  The food was delayed for a long time, and once it was brought out, you could tell the nachos had been under a heat lamp for a while.  They did not bring guac with the smothered burrito, had to ask for that, did not bring out chips and salsa, which was included as well, had to ask for that twice.  No salsa with the fajitas, and had to ask 3 times for a box near the end of the meal. I am almost positive that the dirty dishes are still on the table, as they were ignored until we were standing up to leave.  Also, the shrimp nachos were pretty skimpy and bland.  Overall: not a nice experience and we will not return.",0.0

"Meh, Buddy V's is a 3.5 stars for me but rounding down because of slow service and complicated bill -_-

I made a reservation at Buddy V's for my birthday. We were a large party of 15 that seated us pretty quickly once our whole party arrived. I know that we were a large party but I just felt like the overall service was very slooow.....The older man (maybe the manager) walked us very s l o w l y....to the table and as we were seated, it just took a long time to get our utensils or menus. It was around 4:45 when we arrived and the restaurant didn't look too crowded at the time.

I am a huuuge fan of moscow mules and I make it a point to try a restaurant's signature mule. Buddy V's has a ""Jalapeno Mule"" on their cocktail menu and I was instantly intrigued and pleasantly surprised upon tasting it. It was bright and zesty, but the subtle kick of jalapenos would kick in afterwards. It's not a really overwhelming spice, but rather quite refreshing. Highly recommend trying this!

And for my meal, I ordered the linguini and clams and shared with my friend who ordered the sea scallops. Much to my disappointment, the linguini was super salty and extra garlicly. I didn't mind the garlic but the salt was just too much for me and found myself taking gulps of water in between bites. The sea scallops on the other hand were quite enjoyable. The creamy bed of polenta beneath the beautifully seared scallops complemented it well.

The dessert was probably the highlight of the meal. The Italian birthday cake was soo delicious. I'm not a big fan of desserts because I don't have much of a sweet tooth but the sweetness of all the different layers was not very overpowering in this. I loved the chocolate mouse layer. So dreamy....

It was time for the check and here's where things got unnecessarily complicated. Again, service was slow and we seemed to be waiting for forever for the check to come out. Prior to even ordering I had asked if we could split the check into separate bills, by tables, since we were a large party. They had forgotten, but no big deal, I asked them if they could fix it and they said they would. We wanted to split the bill to put it on two separate cards. When they brought back the check and I took a look at it, I was so confused. Our server had literally split everything on the check in half (see my photos), which made it 39247038x more difficult for my party to figure out who we needed to pay back. I clarified with our waiter what I wanted and off he went to fix our check. What could possibly go wrong? So instead of just ringing up another two new bills, he took a looong time trying to move halves from the two checks around. So instead of ""linguini and clams"" on the bill it said ""1\/2 linguini and clams"" twice. He spent a long time trying to move things around but didn't move everything properly. I think it would've taken equally as long to just create two new bills where each meal was not a half.

So yeah, that was frustrating to deal with. Everyone was getting grumpy because we had been in the restaurant for so long because of the slow service and we were ready to leave after two hours of being there. But our waiter did try...and he was nice...just not efficient. Overall, good food and a nice interior! However, I was expecting a little more from the service since it wasn't too crowded but hey, they tried.",0.0
"My sister and I were walking around the store looking for things for a good 45 minutes and no one greeted us or offered to help. It wasn't very busy as it was around 8 PM. This Ulta location, like a lot of other locations was very clean and the bathroom was well kept. 

I usually prefer Ulta over Sephora because of their sales and they were having some pretty good deals when I went in. When we checked out, I told the cashier that Revlon products were currently buy one, get one free and there was a sign. I saw that the sale was valid from 1\/1-1\/7 and she went to check on that. She did adjust the price for us but, after we paid, we decided to buy more Revlon items since its usually never BOGO! But, right when we were walking back, she went to the Revlon section and took the sign down and tossed it. So, we decided to go to a different Ulta tomorrow. Its part of Ulta's sale and is valid until tomorrow so I'm not sure why the sales associate took it down and made a comment about it to her coworker. I'll drive a bit further to the Spring Valley location as the workers there are much nicer and more helpful. 

If you know what you want to buy and need little or no help with your shopping trip, then come to Ulta. If you want some make up suggestions or help on applying makeup, I would stick to Sephora.",0.0

"I was referred from my dentist, to have 4 wisdom teeth extracted here. I originally had my appointment set for today, which I scheduled about 2\/3 weeks ago. Throughout these 2\/3 weeks, there was a ton of back and forth with the office and I over insurance. Originally my dentist who referred me gave them my OLD insurance info, vs. my new updated insurance so there was some confusion. 

They texted me which I thought was kind of odd & unprofessional because they often wouldn't respond till days and days later... defeating the purpose, and instead of the woman saying hey there may have been a mistake with the insurance information, she just keeps jumping to tell me it would be $2300 she said it like 3 times. Like no slow down.. , I have insurance, stop just going directly to how much I need to pay.. focus on step 1, confirming correct info. I sent text messages with everything laid out and spelled out very simply put including ID numbers socials etc, she still was trying to explain how I don't have insurance with them anymore and that she called already and they said I was termed last year (BS) Clearly she did not go off of the text messages I sent her or actually try to verify, she was going off of old information from my dentist who referred me. And instead of checking she just said nope its $2300. Literally finally today she  just told me (15 mins before my app) that miraculously it was verified. Aka she didn't check throughout the 3 weeks she just checked today, even after her saying she called them .. Anyways insurance finally did go through, and brought my co pay down to $800, which still seemed to be high to me... I asked about payment plans and she said since I wanted to do the operation fully I need to pay fully I felt that was mocking me in a sense. I wish they would have been focused on the fact my mouth is in pain and these teeth need to come out. I understand it won't be free, but I was still surprised it was roughly $800 upfront and no financing options at all.

"Some friends and I came out to watch 2017 Arizona Fall League baseball. I have been to this stadium a couple of times previously. During this visit, we noticed that the field does not appear to be in very good shape as the grass is not very green and there are numerous areas where wear is apparent, especially between the dugouts and home plate. The outfield berms are also not very esthetically pleasing due to the large brown spots. Some of these issues are due to the recently completed season.

"I rarely write reviews but this was ridiculous. My fiancé and I have one night a week where we don't have our children and we decided to spend it at this location. The table that we sat at had an employee who was off work that day, and her boyfriend who was celebrating his birthday. To start off, the boyfriend had his tire slashed in the parking lot apparently by an employee of Benihana over some drug dealing dispute. This was all told to us by the other employees while the two came and went from our table frequently from going outside, to calling the police. 

So then, the police showed up inside to investigate what happened. They were right next to us inside the lobby area discussing all while our chef was making the food. My fiancé and I, as well as another couple are confused at this point and a little bothered that there's so much commotion by our table. 

The couple returns to the table while the police are still there in the lobby. The boyfriend yells at the chef and said he wanted his food well done. The chef said that he wasn't there to tell him how he wanted it done so he played it safe. The boyfriend began yelling at the chef and then we defended the chef by saying he wasn't there and it wasn't right to do that. He then began yelling at us (by the way, he was very drunk and maybe high) and at my fiancé. The girlfriend who is also an employee at the location then started cursing at us, and the other couple.

It was at this point that I asked what should be an obvious question - ""Why should I buy glasses here that I know have a huge markup when there are so many online stores for much less money?"". It was explained to me that the online peeps could not truly determine where my pupils were in relation to the progressions in the lenses and so I'd never have a truly expertly cut pair and my ultimate satisfaction would be minimal...ok....I get it, It sounded like a fair answer. I go through the sales part and am explaining that my job demands that I see mostly close range on a computer screen so please ensure the reader portion is emphasized. So I get my over $1k pair of glasses some time later and find myself trying to locate that tiny little portion at the bottom of my lenses as I tilt my head back to read a computer screen. And the overall near and far were pretty well off to boot. I go back and they want to make physical adjustments such as trying to raise the bridge further up which then puts my eyes at the bottom of the lenses. Sigh. I give them the benefit and try it out for another few weeks. Finally, I go back and request another set be cut. This time I see a different doctor who finally asks if he can re-examine my eyes after which he determines I have been diagnosed with the wrong prescription. Sigh.

"I'm surprised to see this place rated 3.5 stars on almost 300 reviews because the food is atrocious. On my first visit a while back I recall ordering a pasta dish that resembled more of a soup; it was drenched in sauce. Now, about my most recent visit that made me write this review. I needed some late night food, had limited options and was craving some mac and cheese, so I thought why not give 7 West a try. Ordered a mac and cheese for takeout, and to be absolutely fair, I'd rather eat Kraft Dinner, just look at the picture here. And no, I didn't purposefully take the picture mid-meal to try to make it look worse - it can't be, it really tastes just as bad as it looks. Wow",0.0
"Made appointment online but when I arrived was ignored by reception for a good 30 minutes. Then when she asked what I wanted, I said, ""the service I booked an appointment for."" My Groupon said ""pending,"" so I had to pay cash. You pay up front if not a member. The areas are all private and the place is large. Curtains separate the areas so you hear people talking. My masseuse, Jessica, did a great job! She really went deep on my muscles with lots of pressure. I have back issues so painful massages are good because they loosen the muscles for me. She did hover by the tipping sign at the end; she seemed unhappy with the $15 tip I gave (on a $55 service, that was the full price). I'm never a big tipper so in my world, this is a decent tip. She grunted when I gave it to her, and couldn't immediately answer the question I was asking due to counting the $. I hope these people are paid an hourly wage and not living on tips. I was waiting for the argument but got out before anyone started pressuring. The place was pleasant. The service decent. I would return but am nervous about the tip pressuring. I think this is bad business and I could see people experiencing it.",0.0

"This is a Michael Symon restaurant. That guy is suppose to be a big deal. I get it, he's been on various shows on the Food Network, but I'm just not that impressed. If you are a big drinker, you may love this place since they have plenty of alcohol to choose from. 

First of all, the waiter was a little rude. My friends and I all ordered water for our drinks. He basically asked if we were just going to have water. In retrospect, I should have told him that we are here just to drink our glasses of water and than leave. If we just want food, and no alcohol, there is nothing wrong with that. 

I ordered the turkey breast which came with ""Cleveland pickles"", Cleveland Kraut"", and white bread. You're pickles and kraut aren't unique to Cleveland, but that's how they list it on the menu. I put some of the bbq sauce on the turkey, and it was okay. It was a vinegar based bbq sauce, but nothing great. I also tried my friend's spare rib. It was pretty good, but a little fatty. I finished all my food, so it was good enough.

"STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE!

I cannot impress upon you any more adamantly than what I'm telling you! 

I had previously good experiences with this company regarding my 2000 F-350 dually 4x4 diesel. They repaired a previously installed ECU MODULE that was poorly installed. I had dealt with (wheelchair) Mike whom I thought was the owner based on what I perceived to be a sincere and honest attempt to please his customer. 

In April I took my truck to their new facility on East Merlayne drive to have an oil change, clutch replacement, new shifter knob and air filter cleaning. 

They promised to have the truck done in 3 days and it ended up being 3 WEEKS!

They lied to me numerous times regarding completion date.

Here comes the good part!

When I picked up my truck it felt like there were no bushings holding the shifter in place! I was correct !

I took the truck back and they refused to listen to my concerns stating ""there is no adjustment to the shifter""
I dealt with both Mikes regarding this!

Turns out I was correct! I took it to a shop
right down the street and they confirmed my suspicions! It was reassembled without one of the plastic bushings and  this WAS OK FOR UNDERGROUND DIESEL?

It gets better!

After driving the truck for a week or so
It started making a horrible vibration on the freeway coming from the front end!

This caused damage to one of the gears in the transfer case!

"I will preface this by saying if you are religious, this may be a great choice to have your wedding ceremony.

However, if you are not, I strongly urge to look elsewhere.

Upon entering the building, we were a little put off by how broken down the inside of the building was. Cracked drywall, dirty paint, doors that barely open without a good nudge, imagine a scene in a movie where you're showing up to a shady lawyer's office.

Anyway, we arrive a little early and gave Melinda a call. She showed up after a few moments and guided us over to the marriage licensing office. This part of the process was very simple and Melinda was very friendly.

We go back and meet the minister. I would be inclined to believe this is not the norm, but he wore an old collared shirt and sweatpants to our marriage ceremony. He did apologize for his attire, but considering his position and title,I found this a little strange. Regardless of this, and a few other off putting signs, I was willing to overlook it and probably would have never written this review if the following would not have happened.

We begin our marriage ceremony, and he speaks for about 10 minutes in what makes a good marriage, how we should treat each other, etc. Everything he said up until this point was true and thoughtful. I even appreciated some of his insight. However, he reaches a point where he asks us if we believe in God. I was caught off guard and don't understand how this was relevant and why he felt the need to ask us. I considered lying because I had a feeling of what was going to follow but couldn't get myself to do it, so I truthfully said no. 

This leads him on a spiel to convince me to believe in God. More or less, it was an attempted conversion session. I signed up to have someone administer my wedding and be on my way, and yet, I was thrust into an extremely uncomfortable situation and had no choice but to maintain a cordial attitude for the sake of my wife, and the situation. Withholding the details of what he said, after awhile and probably too long, he eventually catches on to our discomfort and we move on to finish the marriage ceremony. 

I have no doubts that they were very kind people, but the need to feel like you need to ""fix"" another persons life and beliefs were very inappropriate and unprofessional. Especially in a place you run business. To call this place ""simple weddings"" is a vast understatement from my experience. 

Again, if you are religious, more power to you, and this very well may be a great place to conduct your marriage. But if you're not, be weary.",0.0

"So, I have been coming here on and off throughout the last 2 Years. The food hasn't changed but this is not my reasoning for leaving this Yelp with only 1 Star. 

They have the atmosphere of a great Mexican style restaurant, however the cleanliness of their utensils and drink-ware are always a problem. I gave this place a rest for a couple months HOPING that things would change. 

However, to my dismay I came back with my buddy for lunch ordered a cheese quesadilla with rice and beans. My buddy had to ask the waitress for a whole new utensil placement cause there was caked on food, she sarcastically said ""oh someone already ate on it"" 

Thinking that was the end of the dirty dishes I started eating my food when it arrived I took a couple of sips of my soda and as it got a little lower I noticed something on the cup, taking a quick glance thinking it was from the salsa on the outside. But as I picked up the cup the caked on food was on the inside. How do I know this was not mine was clear as I have been using a straw the whole time. 

That was it I didn't eat anything anymore or drink anything. So this is why the 1 Star.

So to the owner\/manager, please advise your dishwashing crew to first rinse off all food before placing it in the dishwasher. And second to whomever your waitstaff is, please have them observe the utensils that they are wrapping to ensure that the dishwashing crew are doing their job. 

It's a team thing not just one person. I did my part by informing our waitstaff however this should never be an ongoing issue.

I will not be returning to this establishment sadly, however to whom ever goes there please be observant in the overall experience of your dining.

"Came here on Thursday night on a date night with my boyfriend since we were in the area. It's a small and cozy restaurant with really great ambiance. We were first greeted warmly by the hostess. She asked what our preferred seating was and was happy to accommodate. Freyan, I believe his name was, was our waiter. He totally did not seem like he wanted to be there nor did it seem like he wanted to do his job. He did not ask us whether or not we wanted a beverage (boyfriend wanted a beer). Although he did tell us his favorites, he did not come back to our table after leaving us menus for at least 20 minutes. If the restaurant was filled up a little more, we would have been more understanding but it was less than half full (we came in a little after 8pm so well after the dinner rush). finally after 20 minutes he came back without a smile, asked us for our order, and left. Another 20 minutes or so passed before our food came to us. Ten minutes after we got our food, he realized my empty water cup at the end of the table needed refilling. We ordered the cavatelli porchetta, large. Although it was definitely smaller than expected, the food was delicious. Pork was tender and sauce was delicious. 

Although the food was delicious, I'm honestly disappointed with this place.

#2 - The One Nevada Credit Union location off of Stephanie and Eastern do not issue cash at their desks.  If you want to withdraw a higher figure, you will have to go to the bank and have the bank teller enter in the withdrawal amount in their system and will direct you to an ATM to make the withdrawal.  In essence, two lines?? Now they say after you've banked with them long enough, you will be able to make the request over the phone for the withdrawal amount increase and then visit an ATM.  (Each time you need it.  Inconvenient right?  The Manager attempted to recover my dissatisfaction on this aspect and said he would call me when I was expecting my deposits to offer to enter in the information for me ahead of time, so that things were prepared.  Well, that happened only the one time an apology was offered.  And conveniently for them, after I had deleted my old Yelp rating.)

#3 The Personal Banker (Anna Poppo?) asked me if I wanted her to enroll me online so I can access to my banking information once I left the bank.  Although I declined, she still proceeded to arrange this.  Not sure if she gets credit for this or something? But why ask if you are not really giving me the option.

#4 About 2 months with my new account, I get a phone call from this Personal Banker.  She advised that she had not obtained a signature (or ensured it was legible on her end), so she asked me to come to the bank again to sign.  Now for the majority, this may not be a big deal; however, most of my complaints stem from being medically put on bedrest and having limitations with going out.  Now because she failed to ensure something was solidified, I again have to have the inconvenience of making another trip to their branch for something they failed to check.  (As a side note:   I anticipate that it was because the original account was opened on a Friday afternoon close to closing, she rushed to just get this done as fast as possible.). When I eventually went to the bank, the acting manager had no idea what to do when it came to obtaining the missing information. (Archived signature.) Comforting right?

In closing to the Bank Management Team, don't waste your time attempting to recover in an effort to have me delete my sentiments.  I feel that the population should be made aware of the inconveniences and sloppy behaviors exhibited by One Nevada.",0.0
"I went here this past Saturday for Kaskade and ended up leaving early. 
Loved the house music but the way this club is set up you feel like you can't even get near the dance floor unless you spend 2000 grand on bottle. 

it is so crowded with people just trying to find a spot to stand that it's really ridiculous. I understand the club has to make money but if the lay out was different the place would be so much more fun. I'm from LA so I know the club scene. Most clubs in LA have a flow to which you can walk around and also access the dance floor easily. This club makes you feel like you're an outsider looking in unless you reserved a couch area.

Hey Hakkasan!
Take out some of the couches by the dance floor and get back to the main reason people go to a club, to dance and dance.",0.0
"I did the nine dollar wash yesterday. Dried off the car myself with their rags. The lint coming off the rags is unbelievable. It rained yesterday. So I went back to see if they would honor their rain check policy. I was told that they only do it for the $15 wash. I found the general manager uncompromising. As he would only give me a three dollar run through the tunnel. I will not go back. Nor will I recommend them. I let him know I was a regular member, returning multiple times a month for the last few months.",0.0
"This place doesn't even deserve my one star..chicken is tasteless, the rudest customer service i have ever come across and my order is never correct; everytime i reach home something is missing..and the managers at this south blvd location are all useless..they prefer to argue with customers..i wouldn't waste my money here..never going back and neither should you!",0.0
Should never have gotten rid of the Hess wine! The new wine is nasty. Hopefully they will bring it back,0.0
Worst staff ever they set up ADA seating but did not allow my disabled mother to sit there due to staff discretion according to staff my mother needed to have a walker or wheelchair in order to sit there! I guess this staff got to decide if my mother was disabled enough??? The staff was rude and made no sense in their reasoning. After they told me no they sat two older ladies that did not have walkers nor wheelchairs and when I asked them again and asked why they were sat there he said it was special seating that the manger set aside for special guests. Pretty sure there is a California law against discrimination against disabled people.,0.0
"Went there for New Year's Eve, and definitely not up to the usual D'Vine standards - particularly for the price. Only thing memorable on the menu was the bisque and desert (set menu - seafood or beef). Started with the obviously new\/inexperienced hostess wanting to seat us at a high 4-top near the door, even though we were some of the first people there for the late seating. Besides the noise from the bar and music speakers, it was right next to where the music would start soon. The hostess was adamant that was the only seating she had, even with reservations, but the manager got that straightened out, and it turned out that there were several empty tables in the back during dinner, so no clue why the hostess was jerking us around. Then came the food - the strangest thing served was a large octopus tentacle that frankly looked like an animal's private part, was burnt, and chewed like rubber. I had the Chilean sea bass, which wouldn't have been bad, but it was served on a bed of cold humus, which gave it a weird taste. At any rate, not a very good meal for the cost and the occasion. Guess we'll skip holiday events there, as they appear challenging for them, and stick to going in for wine and appetizers....",0.0
The food does not reflect Southern cooking. The owner is very very rude to the customers.  The owner needs customer service and culinary training.  The food is terrible. Do not waste your time go to Lolo chicken and waffles on central. If that rude owner continue with that nasty attitude he will be out of business.,0.0
"Course is managed and set up like a muni. Fun track with a few challenging holes. My kind of course as it's designed for med handicappers and can produce a low round. 3 star rating for slow play, grouchy starters\/rangers, and cold hotdogs. Same experience every time. Like I said, muni.",0.0
"This is a nice hotel but be aware:  if you cancel outside of the cancellation policy fine print they will charge you the entire amount of your stay. The hotel refused to lessen the amount. I'm OK with paying a fee if canceling on short notice however there was over 21 days before the reservation and the room should've been able to be rebooked. But this Marriott hotel doesn't see it that way. After two tries they charged me for the full stay, charged it to the wrong credit card, and refused to lessen the amount charged. So be aware your cancellation policy otherwise you're going to be out a lot of money from this hotel. 
Sidenote close to my Marriott awards account and will take my business and money to their competitors instead because of this hotel.",0.0
"Convenient and tasty, but there were only two people working during the lunch rush today. One on the assembly line and one on the register\/oven\/expediting. Not efficient at all. We waited in line for over 15 minutes before we even started building, then had to wait again to pay at the register.",0.0
Worst experience ever went here last nite ordered one large sprite get to the window and the cashier told me the drink was $10 five times...finally after she realized that all I had was one drink she told me how she know the board says it's $1 but the manager changed the price...clearly that's false advertising and I wasn't having that everything about this was all wrong aside from me spending 20 min unable to get out of the drive thru the negative attitude from the cashier and the rude manager the soda was just ok... never going back late nite crew is the worst!!!!!!,0.0
"greetings Kailee,
Thanks to your reply to my review. I am sure that Critter care is concerned regarding the health of my pets especially while they are in your care. That is why I sign a release for them to receive emergency medical care in my absence should they require it. Prior to boarding my fur babies you require proof of vaccinations which my pet's receive at their yearly wellness visit from a licensed Veterinarian at which time he would disclose any abnormalities found during the exam and they would receive treatment for. So let's be CLEAR no matter how you disguise the charge of an additional $50 dollars per pet for boarding it is a charge that is excessive. To other pet owners I would continue to be cautioned to be aware of being charged unnecessarily just because the Dr. at Critter Care didn't get their cut of an exam fee.",0.0
"Very poor service from the server to the manager. We had ordered 2 chicken and waffle orders, but only 1 came out. 20 min later the order still hadn't come out. The waiter said ""it was coming"". It seemed like he was avoiding us. The rest of us had finished our meals and still no order in sight. Finally we had to flag our waiter to talk to the manager. The manager was not very apologetic. He was justifying the problem by saying they ran out of chicken. They should have been honest w\/ us as soon as our food started coming out or when they first realized in the kitchen. We would have been understanding and happily ordered something else.
Working in customer service, you want your customers to walk out feeling at least satisfied even if there was a problem. The manager didn't offer anything to make us feel better except that he'll take the chicken and waffle meal off our order...which is a given since we never got it. It's very disappointing when you walk out of a business feeling upset and frustrated. I felt bad for my friend who never got his meal. Hopefully this review will help improve their customer service or possibly they don't care like how we felt.",0.0
"We had looked forward to trying Lemongrass based on in-room TV ads and our passion for Thai food.  We arrived at 3:15pm.  There was nobody at the hostess stand.  Nearly 10 minutes later a woman appeared with not one drop of interest in her job and seated us.  After waiting 10 minutes and not being waited on, we left.  I politely introduced myself to the manager as we left and I was told, ""So sorry.""

It's unappetizing when seemingly half the tables in a restaurant have not been cleared of dirty dishes.  Lemongrass wins the award for the most uncleared tables!

Needless to say, I cannot score Lemongrass favorably.",0.0

"My wife and I were just in. She was buying 4 bottles of champagne for her and her friends, and I was along for the ride. The cashier asked for my wife's ID, she obliged. Then the cashier asked for my ID. I checked my pockets and realized I left my wallet at home. I explained the situation and reiterated that I wasn't buying anything. They called a manager over, I repeated what I just said to the cashier, and they concluded that they couldn't sell my wife the champagne because I didn't have my ID. FYI We are both in our mid 30s and in no way look near as young as 21. This was an embarrassing situation that I won't soon forget. Please change this ridiculous policy.",0.0
"I had a series of mishaps with COIT, to start with I hired them instead of a local business because I've not always had the best luck with ""mom & pops"" and wanted to be sure my white sofa was cleaned correctly and well.  First there was the scheduling issue but that was resolved in the end so ok.  Second the Tech that came out was nice but cocky, not rude but not super customer friendly.  I was told by the couch manufacture it needed to be dry cleaned, the tech insisted he would not be able to get it very clean this way and that steam clean wouldn't damage it and would have better results.  I approved the steam clean but was very disappointed at the results, many of the stains and markings were not removed. Understanding that I purchased the couch second hand and do not know what they were I still anticipated better results.  Then there was the pricing issue, I was quoted $125 for the cleaning and $50 for ""COIT Guard"" plus had a 35% off discount when I booked the appointment. The tech had no record of this and charged me $175 for the cleaning alone because ""there weren't any notes on his paperwork""!  He took off the 35% but wanted to charge me an additional for the ""COIT Guard"".  After explaining the issues I'd had he didn't charge me for the ""COIT Guard"" but when I called the Salesperson about the discrepancy, he didn't return my call.  At the end of the day my biggest complaint is the fact that my couch was steam cleaned instead of the recommended dry clean and still wasn't as clean as I would have liked.",0.0
"Tonight I walked In to this establishment and was seated by the hostess. I waited... and waited ... and waited for 25 minutes while watching  four waitresses walk by me .... not one of them asked if I'd been helped. Then the same hostess walked by and looked at me ... clearly realizing that after so much time passed I still hadn't been helped. She immediately came to my table asked if anyone helped, then took my order. She brought out my food and occasionally checked up me. She was awesome! Although the boneless wings tasted like they were two days old I didn't  complain simply because the hostess was so nice! She would be the only reason that I would change this one star to a five .... if you eat here  I'd suggest asking for Dee (detoria)  the hostess to be your waitress",0.0
"Use to love it!!!! I was craving it and I went in my last experience wasn't great but I thought I would give it another try. So disappointing. I use to work at the place that's how much I loved their food. The place has completely gone down hill since the last time I was there... The food use to be amazing I took my mom and her friend there, I had been raving about it. As such a unique place. Having worked there at one time I felt I had an edge on what was good but I was very disappointed. It wasn't just me who was disappointed my mom and her friend were also let down by their meal we ordered my old favorites: snow crab traditional boil 2 with sausage, potatoes, and corn. The crab was way over cooked and I don't think they put any spice in it maybe they have gotten too many complaints on the spice level but I was looking forward to not feeling my lips. Then there was the fried shrimp and Cajun fries. The shrimp tasted like rubber and the fries tasted like they were cooked 3 hours earlier. Then there was the mac n Cheese my once favorite.... it was luke warm and Missing the signature jalopeno. I never give bad reviews but I was really disappointed in the food quality. What happened this place use to be so amazing.",0.0
"Great hotel. Very clean. Don't like having to pay a $34 resort fee (pool, wi-fi & gym) for services not used. They found a way to legally steal $34 from people. It would look better if they just raised the room rate instead of telling someone they're being charged for service they didn't use.",0.0
"This place is a pretty decent German restaurant.  The food is fairly true to what German food is.  It has some items that are more of a cross breed of American\/Wisconsin and German.  One of these are the Brat Stickers, think potstickers for Wisconsinites.  They also have some family style specials that sounded great.  All you can eat at a decent price is always nice.

They really have a good selection of German beers on tap, which is much better than the bottled versions you can find that have that aged funk to them.  I sampled a fee and was very happy.  With Madison becoming such a hot spot for craft beer and tap houses, the quality of beer was very welcome.

I did have an issue with their billing though.  I had ordered a 17oz beer and the server told me that the keg was tapped.  They were only able to offer me a partial pour, but she confirmed that the amount would be reflected in the price.  The beer was $4.25 for 17oz.  I was given an 8oz glass that was barely half full.  The charge was $3.75.  So they discounted it $0.50 for only receiving about 1\/3 of a full glass.

Up until I saw the bill, I was enjoying my visit.  Who doesn't love beer and cake?  If that hadn't happened, I'd happily put this place at a solid 4 stars.",0.0
This company is horrific!!! Paid them to kill Bees.  They did not kill all the bees the tech said the bees would be gone in about a week.  After 2 weeks bees were still active and a child was stung by one of the bees.  I called the company back to kill the bees and the tech tried to get more money out of me.  The tech hung the phone up on me after I asked him to do the job I paid for.  I am in the process of  contesting the charges.  I will never use their services again and will be sure to make my friends aware...,0.0
After years of watching Chef Ramsay make over restaurants and critique staff I am very underwhelmed by my experience here. The bathrooms were dirty as well as the dining room floor. The wait staff appeared more interested in figuring out their sections and which was better. My curry rice was crunchy. I would rate my mule's hind leg was a 5 though!,0.0
"In my 52 years on this planet, I have never dealt with a worse company than Sharp Contracting. I had sharp install a stamped concrete pool deck, the actual concrete was nice, the finishing work and customer service were terrible.  The first time the deck was colored and sealed, I raised some concerns about the color and rough finish around the pool edge.  The worker, who was already pissed off that he was working all day by himself, got a bit mouthy with me and told me to talk to a supervisor.  So I did talk to a supervisor that evening, Alan actually called me.  Turns out the employee that was at my house, told Alan a complete lie about how I yelled and cursed at him complaining about the work.  Of course that never happened, their employees have some serious integrity issues.  The deck was finally colored and sealed and looked pretty good, however the day that they sealed the deck, it rained later in the afternoon.  When I contacted Sharp to let them know about my concerns, they said "" don't worry, you have a 2 year warranty"".  Well one year later, the sealer began to fail, and the color was failing in some areas as well.  They did come out to repair the deck finish, but all they did was spend about 15 minutes spraying sealer over all of the affected areas, and refused to recolor the areas that need it.  I complained and emailed pictures to Sharp and never got a response.  Please don't waste your time, money and aggravation with Sharp Contracting!",0.0
"So terribly disappointed with this company.  After a poor experience dealing with their GM, Alan, I let him know I'd be sharing my poor experience on yelp in which he replied ""we're going to research you and make a bad yelp review where you work.""  Really?!  Threatening clients for posting their opinion of your service is an interesting route to take, Alan.  Long story short... In addition to providing terrible customer service, this company does not stand by their work or products.  They up sold me on an LED light package saying it would last for 10 years.  One year later 2 of the lights are now out and are non-replaceable.  Alan told me the product is discontinued so there's nothing they can do.  I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere for landscaping and paying attention to the other reviews on here.... I wish I would have!",0.0
"The pizza isn't bad here- it's just so over priced- it has you scratching your head. 

Tonight I had the pizza and wings special, which was around $22, so not bad. I added the garlic rolls, which for some god forsaken reason they call ""Passion rolls""? It's perplexing to me, but there you go. I also ordered a slice of chocolate cake $6.00 which ended up being so dry and chalky-it tasted how I imagine space food would taste. Bland, and completely devoid of flavor. 

Lastly I ordered my stuff online and selected it to be ready in one hour. I arrived at the appointed time and was told the ""passion"" rolls were just starting to cook. Again- this isn't life and death- but it's weird that even with an hours notice my food couldn't be on time 

In summary- the pizza is respectable, but the price point and other issues here make it hard to place this spot in your regular rotation.  I am happy to pay good money for top tier pizza- but this isn't special pizza- just regular so I don't see how they justify the higher than reasonable prices.",0.0

"I had the pleasure of spending a valuable Saturday afternoon waiting for this store to fix their mistake. I bought 4 new tires a week ago and they decided to only install 3. When I brought this to their attention their response was ""I don't know how that could happen"" I can think of one!",0.0

"If you care about your pet do NOT take your pet here. 

I called in advance two times to make and confirm my appointment. When I brought my 10 year old cat Bossa Nova there, they told me they'd call be if there will be any issues. 5 hours later, I didn't recieve any calls so I assumed the bath was done. When I went to pick her up, they had fucking left Bossa Nova IN THE CARRIER for 5 HOURS with NO WATER or food. That aside they did not call me as they said they would if there were issues. Apparently Bossa Nova would not let them handle her for a bath so as a result they didn't give her one and just NEGLECTED her. I was outraged and when I asked them why they didn't call me they said ""they didn't know and thought their co worker did it already"".

"My daughter and I were on this end of the strip looking for a nice place for dinner...This is an upscale restaurant inside New York New York. The food is good and the service was wonderful but I thought the tables were too close together and the price is way too high for what you get. The ambiance is nice and romantic but there are many places in Vegas where you can get upscale food and not break the bank. We ordered one steak (cheapest on the menu at $48), a market price fish at $45 and an order of asparagus (6 pieces for $10)...so our total came to $103 without tip! I'm not opposed to paying for good quality- I just didn't feel like this was anything special or that I need to come back for- I have plenty of that style of food right where I live. There are other places that are unique to Vegas and I'd go to those.",0.0
"When I found this foot spa on Yelp, I saw under the description that they had a $25 1 hour massage deal. When I called, the lady had no clue what I was talking about, and said she didn't know the price on their website (seriously?) and said she would call me back. She then called back and told me it would be $28 instead, so I thought not a huge deal, and scheduled an appointment for me and my friend. 

The massage overall was okay, but nothing spectacular... it's pretty average but definitely not bad either. 

When my friend and I went to pay, she seemed frustrated that we weren't paying with cash (they never once told me it's cash only, and they have all the capabilities to accept charge cards, so why the attitude?) She then asked me to enter my tip, and once I did, I kid you not, she told me my tip was too low... and proceeded to ask if I would leave more. I said no, because I was honestly offended by the rude nature of being asked to leave more when I didn't feel it was deserved (especially by this point.) She continued asking me about 3 times if I would raise my tip by $2 (is she seriously fighting over $2 when I paid more than I was going to originally anyway before they bait and switched the price on me?) 

My friend and I got in my car and she says to me, ""I honestly can't believe they were that rude to us.""

With the dozens upon dozens of massage options in this area, I can comfortably say I will NEVER be back. And I hope no one else is a victim of their horrible customer service.

"Panini's is a restaurant that our family has enjoyed going to over the years and that ends now.  We went in July and everything was terrible.  Our service was SO slow, half of the order was wrong, the food that did come out wasn't warm, and then we were charged for the food we got that we didn't order.  We left extremely disappointed and frustrated.  Fast forward to today - we decided to give it another chance - bad choice.  The restaurant was quite empty but again we waited quite some time to even place our order and then we waited a good 40 minutes for our food to arrive.  Some food was warm some was cold.  The sauce on the wings wasn't correct. We then had to wait forever for our waitress to bring the bill.  Fool me once shame on you... fool me twice shame on me... there will not be a third time.

"After enjoying STK in Vegas a few times I was so excited for it to come to Toronto.  Unfortunately, it is nothing like the Vegas location.  

Food - This was very very very bad. Crab salad was tasteless.  Cevice tasted extremely vinegary and WAY too many olives, it tasted like the old dregs of a Greek salad. Steak was too salty (although well cooked and a nice cut of meat).  The sides (asparagus, mushrooms) were grossly greasy.  The food was pretty much on par with lets say... Moxies... Lol.

The atmosphere - while the decor is nice the music was AWFUL last night - think lots of Journey songs to make you feel like you are a frat party or Irish pub, followed by ... I am not kidding here... disco music.  Ring My Bell and everything. 

Service - very good, quick, were able to get us a table without a reservation in a reasonable amount of time, bathroom attendant was very friendly, bar staff charged phone, doormen very nice.  Thankfully, they got the service down.

"Located right next to PET and in the same plaza as Pho Metro. 

I really wanted to like this place. It hurts me to write a low review for a small family business. I do think this place has potential if work on their recipes. We came on a weekday evening and my family was the only one there the entire sitting. It's a new owner and menu, this place used to be something else before can't remember the name but it was more of an HK cafe before. Now they only do Taiwanese noodles. 

My family all ordered 4 different noodle dishes. They came out at different times like probably 2-3 minutes apart from each other. Not sure why service was a little slow considering we were the only ones there. But anyways...the noodles were good, chewy, thick and good texture. When it came to the soup base though it was a letdown. It was extremely salty and lacked flavor. I got the beef brisket with clear noodle soup. The beef briskets were nice and lean. 
The portion size was on par for the price we were paying (8.75) for a bowl. I would say it was between a standard medium and large bowl of noodles. 
We also ordered a scallion pancake but that was not impressive either. It could definitely be crispier, it was chewy and soft in the center.

"Phoenix Medical Group would not write off a balance of $598 for my mother even though she passed away two months ago, probably from the poor care she received here. Other groups wrote off thousands without even asking for her death certificate. My mother did not even have an estate and PMG still threatened to put her into collections. In fact they gave me the number to collections to ask how I would be sued for not paying. Nice.

"Been here a few times to grab a quick cappuccino. It's good and hits the spot. Haven't touched any of the food they have here... but it looks delish!

This is a 4 star rating dropped to 2 since I really dislike how they do line-ups here. I got conflicting instructions on both my visits, the first time the lady told me I didn't need to wait in the long line for a quick coffee (people line-up for sandwiches and that takes at least 5-10 minutes). So when I went in for my 2nd visit, I sheepishly asked if it was OK if I cut in line to get a coffee and another lady told me I needed to go all the way back in the line. OOOOOK. She was polite about it even though I was really confused.

I proceeded to do so and left after 5 minutes since the line barely moved as they prepped lunch plates, the other staff members chatting it up with her patrons with occasionally looking back at the other lady who staring at the line doing nothing, with no coffee being made. Pointless. I could have easily had my coffee made, paid and took off. So instead they lost a sale and earned a mediocre review.

They REALLY need to work on this. People just want a coffee and waiting in the same line  other people do which they order this lunch waiting upwards to 15 minutes is just silly. I'm pretty sure there are others who would feel the same way I do.

I do recommend coming here if you're a student though. It's pretty quiet and lots of available seating if you want to study. Coffee is good. Really not a place to drop in to grab a quick coffee.",0.0
Horrible Customer Service. I ordered online since they always get the order wrong over the phone. I asked for white rice versus fried rice and noted it. They did not even acknowledge it. I then called once food came with wrong item and asked them to return with the white rice. I waited over an hour. Called again and they were making excuses for the driver but not once even offered an apology or even anything off of the bill. She then tells me to eat it. I advised I wont since it is nasty to me and not my preference and then she proceeds to ask what she can do about it. I asked her to bring me the white rice I asked for so I could eventually eat my cold food with it. Not once even offered to redo my meal since it was messed up.....smh......AND FOR SOME REASON IF YOU PAY WITH A CREDIT CARD. THEY KEEP IT ON FILE. EVEN IF YOU ASK THEM TO REMOVE IT FROM THEIR SYSTEM. RED FLAGS!!!,0.0

"Came to this resto at 2:30pm on a Saturday with my husband. It's not their peak hours. There are a ton of clean empty seats all around. When we first walked in there are three ladies standing at the front. Totally doing nothing. They barely greeted us with a smile. They told me the it will be a few minutes for the table. Waited 8 mins and they didn't even make eye contact with us. They even seated a party of two that came after us. We were the only ones at the front now. The resto is barely at capacity. I'm in the restaurant business so I know. I then went over and asked politely if we can just sit at the bar tables by the windows. There are about five tables available. And the entire bar counter seating is empty. The lady (apparently her name is Renee, the GENERAL MANAGER) rudely said ""sure if u want"". Again barely making eye contact. I'm shocked that at a restaurant of such scale and class, there are such rude hostesses. What a disgrace to Jamie olivers name. Our server was overall okay. But the GM already ruined our mood. Shame.

We ordered an arugula salad, crispy calamari and porcini fettuccine. The calamari had no flavour. The croutons on our salad was CLEARLY stale. I could barely bite through it. You can taste the staleness. We told our server and she asked their head chef to make new ones. 25 mins passed and no croutons in sight. Meanwhile everyone else's food around us was coming out. The fettuccine was okay. A bit salty. Anyway we will never come here again. Once again. Shame.",0.0
"Arrived with a party of 12 and we were seated right away. We were warned they only had one cook so it might take a while which was ok.

Full of fat and what little meat there was was soft and mushy, I ate about 3 bites before deciding I didn't want to risk  getting ill. I told the server and she offered to get me something else but by that time I had lost my appetite, she said she didn't know what else she could do, apparantly they don't have a manager.

"Short review: Extremely overpriced. They charge for soda refills. Stay away.

Details: I am usually a balanced reviewer but honestly this place does deserve one star. When you are seated the first thing they ask you is if you want to start with sparkling water ($$) then when you have the menu on your hand they ask you if you want to have a green salad to start ($$) Pasta dishes are above 20 dollars and main dishes between 28 and 37. People in the table next to us were clever and they only had the bottle of water, paid and left. We order two sodas, with one refill (+$) and two dishes of pasta. It was over 50 dollars.

It is clear that this business is struggling and they are banking on their location in front of the TIFF. There are better places for Italian food in Toronto.

"Buyer beware, this is a dishonest shop! If I could give zero stars, I would. I came in for an oil change with a coupon.

If that's the case why wasn't this mentioned prior to the service? They asked me the information about the car prior to the work and knew I was using a coupon and the price of the coupon. Why not mention the extra fee at that point? I've been to other places and elsewhere they are very careful about being sure you understand the costs prior to work being done.

I have been coming here for years now, I have recommended this place to people and they have taken their friends. I have been served by the owner, who is phenomenal.

I have overlooked this because the food is good and on occasion the owner would serve us and give us a great experience.

And anyways the bread is free."" I was appalled. He offered to replace the one moldy roll with a fresh one and that was it. Over and over he repeated ""it was only a little bit of mold"". This made me question all the other food, if a little bit of mold was acceptable for a customer to eat then what else was acceptable?

"I have rated this with 2 stars solely based on my past experience and today's experience.  Let me start off by saying that the business is under new management, which as we all know can be a good or bad thing.  I pulled up and an attendant was quick to greet me, however it was not Seth.  As usual, I asked for him and learned at that time that it was under new management, he no longer worked there, and they did not give discounts to loyal return customers. Without complaint, I accepted the fact that I was not getting a discount and took my receipt in to pay for the wash.  I paid for the wash and walked away from the register.  I started to look at my receipt then noticed that there was an additional fee, ""SUV\/Van fee"" of $2.  I get the extra charge if I was having a large SUV or truck washed but my SUV is much smaller than most sedans on the road.  I pointed out the extra charge to the woman at the register and she was apologetic but said that there should be a sign posted outside about the extra charge.  I told her that I did not see a sign nor was I told there was an extra charge and she was apologetic but made no effort to offer a refund or discount.  She just told me that the new management added the fees.  I walked outside and looked around in the receiving area and could not find one sign posted about additional fees for an SUV\/Van.  Needless to say that it only takes one bad experience at a business for me not to come back, which is exactly the case with this business!  If management continues their practices they will not be in business for too long!  Word to the wise, ask about additional fees and don't expect to be ""taken care of"" by new management!  Changed my review to one star. If I pay $34 for a car wash I expect the whole car to be clean outside! I shouldn't have to tell them to clean off the road grime and dirt on the whole lower half of the car! Terrible car wash for $34!",0.0
"Camping World Henderson NV

I bought my motor home from Camping World in Houston TX and the experience was great even though they had poor reviews. I needed warranty service in the desert and the most convenient option was Camping World Henderson NV. I checked reviews and true to form they were poor. Poor customer service both in the shop and retail. A couple of reviews talked about feeling taken advantage of by the service department. Well, I went with it anyway as it was the house A\/C and it was an easy swap out because it was already authorized and shipped by Airexcell. 

I showed up an hour before my appointment and checked in at the service desk with Derrick. I've been working with Derrick over the phone for over a week to get everything lined up and he's been great! All looks good until we get to him telling me Airexcell only authorized 1.5 hours labor to make the swap and anything beyond that is on me. So if the unit was modified or any other work is required the shop rate is $129. hour! WOW that seems a little steep! Anyway I mention that if that's the case I would like to see what has to happen before we spend anything beyond whats been authorized. With the reviews I've read I have this vision of this turning into more than just a quick swap out and at their shop rate adding up quickly. 

They take my keys and bring the rig into the shop with me following. This is where this goes sideways and as the others have mentioned the poor customer service is demonstrated. I mention that because of the limited labor allowance and an interest in seeing how its done I would like to sit quietly and watch. Well, you'd have thought I poked both tech's right in the eye! They became very angry and visibly pissed and basically demanded I leave the shop area. The one guy tells me "" I do these all the time, I know what I'm doing"". At this point I reassure them I wasn't trying make them mad just want to see how the unit is installed. They weren't having any of it so I left. You know maybe these guy's should read their reviews so they would understand why someone might have concerns.  

I wonder around the store for what seems only about 20-30 minutes tops and the older guy with the worst attitude finds me cruising the isles. He takes me out and they have the rig generator running and the A\/C on. He has me go in and confirm the unit is working. I put my hand up to the grill which is what Coleman calls a Chill Grill. You can open and close some vent's and control how much goes into the duct system or the living room. It also has filtered air intakes and the grill separates the two air streams so you don't feed cooled air back into the system. The first thing I notice is the cooled air is coming out of the air intakes! Which since I've taken the grill apart before means it was installed backwards! So the guy that claims to ""do these all the time"" doesn't even know which way the grill goes on! Since I know what the problem is and how easy it is to fix I say nothing. My thought is just get out of there and check everything and change the grill out in the parking lot. Who knows what these two would do if I point out they screwed up!

I go back inside to finish up paper work with Derrick. I'm thinking sign something and on my way. Nope, I owe them $ 8 and change for shop towels! Really......whatever, at this point I'm done and just want out of there! I pay up and head out to the parking lot.

I get to the rig and hop in. The generator is still running and A\/C is on. There are 2 large what I guess are shop towels on the passenger seat unused. Hmm are these the very important shop towels I paid for and not even used......again whatever. I shut everything down and check everything out. I unscrew the grill and sure enough the inner plate that separates cooled air from intake air is in backwards! I turn it around and screw everything back in place. Now everything is working as it should.

"First let me start by saying I'm greatful for my new Nissan but  I'm not happy with my experience with my sales man Erick or my finance man David. Both of these guys are total bullshiters, I know I should have expected it after all we have all heard of the ""sales man"" stigma but.... I went in and I was totally  honest about my situation with the car I was financing and was really excited with the letter I received offer a better rate. I like to consider myself a smart girl so I knew I wouldn't  qualify for exactly what was offered in this letter but I felt I deserved a better rate and Erick my salesmen agreed!!! So long story short after Erick tells me the down payment is one price I sign a contract but not before David gets me to ad gap insurance  because of be a fool not to!!! I also purchased an extended warranty for 75000 miles, so now payments are up there but the interest is much lower, so I'm happy. The next day I get a call that I didn't pay the down payment, I Go in and I'm asked for a different amount then previously discussed the manager speaks to me and the I'm asked to SIGN a 2nd contract....then I get a text from Erick saying come in and sign a 3rd contract. When I get there I get all of these numbers thrown at me and told they need a larger amount down after 20 minutes of David bullshiting me about how ""They"" care about me I refuse to pay the larger down payment he leaves the office for 15 minutes comes back  and tells me ok give me $500 more down, so I agree. Then I am pushed off into his manager's office. Now this guy is a jerk but at least you know from the start that he is so I do appreciate him being real. I'm waiting to sign the 3rd CONTRACT  and they notice   my last name is wrong so while we wait for David to correct that I ask him about my contract... So come to find out I no longer had gap and my warreny went from 75000 to 48000, I would have not known this if I didn't ask. Why didn't David or his Manager tell me this. Then I'm signing and I see the interest was not what I was told. Untied Nissan is as shady as the rest of them... oh wait... my new 2017 didn't even have floor mats.. But Erick assured me that he is ordering them.",0.0

"Listen, this place had its beer menu expertly curated and down to a beautiful science. On top of that all of the drafts are half off for happy hour. The beer alone accounts for the quality of this place...unfortunately, there are many things that detract from it. The seriously largest strike I have against them is that they use plastic plates and utensils!! This is 2017!! I can't image how much waste this place is putting out on daily basis. Unless, of course, they are washing each plastic plate and recycling them (didn't see a recycling bin out back). It's a really darn shame. I would have politely discussed this and the reason behind it with the server, but while she was back and forth a few times, she didn't stay long enough for me to get a word in. 

Also, the server didn't seem to be aware of the special beer releases happening. Other than that, there was no paper towel dispenser and no door on the men's stall. I seriously felt like I was in some college bar in the South Side. 

So, I will go there for beer only until they change that outdated behavior of consumption and get the rest of their act together. The Bloomfield location is ten times better.",0.0
"Went with a group to this place because I've heard the hype and we've got several around town now.  

I asked for chicken recommendations and the girl said the chicken club and I asked for side recommendations between the tempura green beans and the sweet potato fries and the girl offered the half and half, so that was a nice option.  I appreciated that.  Since it was hot summer, I just opted for water.  My total was over ten dollar for a side and sandwich, no drink.  

The chicken club was fine, but it was more of a blta.  Most of my sandwich I couldn't  really find the small grilled chicken, however,  it had plenty of bacon and avocado, so it was still good.  It was served on grilled sourdough.  It was a good size sandwich and I took half home, but am a small eater.  

The sweet potato fries were standard.  The green bean fries were a fun addition for a fast food.  I like places that have options rather than just fries.  

Not sure that I will be returning, not because of anything wrong.  Just nothing memorable and a few bucks higher than other fast food.  I didn't ""drool"" over any of the other items I saw.

"Having frequented Hank's in the past, it was the perfect locale for my husband's 50th celebration with the family and a few friends on a Thursday night (off holiday hours). With six out of eight guests ordering cuts, we were eager to enjoy the anticipated delicious meal ahead of us. Disappointingly, 4 out 6 steaks were grossly under cooked. Three ""medium well""s were served ""rare"" and the one ""rare"" was served still mooing... There were no offerings to butterfly our cuts upon ordering and although I know it takes time to cook a thick cut properly to order, the steaks should have been prepared as ordered. One of the four ageeed to have his returned for further time on the flame, but after only 10 minutes, was still too rare to consume. After our complaint, the once attentive wait staff was now unseen and the Manager fully disregarded the circumstance. With a $1,000 tab and four empty bellies, only the returned steak was comped. A very disappointing experience is an under statement and a return visit is highly unlikely. An unfortunate outcome for one of our past faves...",0.0

Still, it took me actually tracking a guy down for us to get our coffee refilled, and the whole atmosphere feels slightly grungy and dated. The whole restaurant is in dire need of a facelift.

"This review is based solely on the food. Service was 5 stars, but we probably got such great service because we were the ONLY people in the restaurant. I ordered the special Cuban Torta, meat was a bit on the skimpy side and flavor was very lacking. No salt or pepper on tables so we had to ask for it.

"This was an interesting experience. I was craving steak and I saw that Carmen's had decent reviews. I decided to give it a try, and the dinner started off very well, as the location was quiet and the decor was nice. The service was very good 10\/10 the waiter and waitress were both very good. We decided to order two set menus ($100 wagyu, and $88 dry aged steak) the two apps were decent, Nothing to talk about, but here is where it went bad. 
We received our steaks, which were both undercooked( it was almost blue and not hot, I wouldn't have even called it warm). We complained and our steaks were put back on the grill and it came back closer to medium. We proceeded to eat and the steaks were hard to cut through (Really? Wagyu beef?) and my steak had sinew all through it and I couldn't eat half of it (the steak knife couldn't even cut through it). We told the waitress and she said she was going to tell her manager we were given a choice of any dessert to make up for our steaks... there was no apology from the manager who did not even acknowledge us throughout the dinner and when we were leaving there was no acknowledgment either. (We were also charged full price for our meals, when we honestly could only eat half of it)

"This place would have been 4 stars if not for the pretentious snobby waitress that we had. This review will be broken down into two parts Service and Food.

Service:
When seated the waitress came up to us immediately and asked what drinks we wanted. Since we just got seated we had to look at the menu first. She rolled her eyes at us and when my husband asked what soda they served she snapped back with we have everything. Really? You have every soda imaginable stocked? She puts in our drink order at the bar and we can see the drinks are ready but to spite us it took her 20 mins to deliver our drinks. We would eye the drinks and she would look back at us, make eye contact, smirk and then reach for other table's drinks.

Additionally, the store serves to go food at the front. My friend has a strict diet due to GI problems and the kitchen refuses any changes to their dishes. The only thing he could eat were some items from the to go section. After explaining the situation, the waitress said NO you cannot get a take out item and eat it at the table. My friend had to leave and get food someplace else.

Then another table asked the same thing. The waitress said no but then changed her mind and let the person at that table get food from the takeout section and eat it with their family. 

Needless to say no tips came from our table.

Food:
I would say the eggs are the best thing for brunch on the menu. I had the eggs with goat cheese. Very silky and fluffy. The goat cheese added a good sharp flavor. Also ordered some butter croissants. The croissants were average. The ends were dry but the middle part was flakey with a nice buttery flavor. The rest of the table ordered a skillet with eggs, beans, ham, bacon and sausage. All agreed that the ham was very flavorful.

"Never really had a problem with Time Warner\/Spectrum when we established service. We called to get connected, we paid the bill, and when we turned on the TV or computer it was all signals all the time. Yea! - except there was mostly nothing worth watching on the internet or cable.
When we moved and had to disconnect it got a little more difficult: I was informed I would be billed until all the stuff was delivered to their office which wasn't really a big deal but they know when the equipment is disconnected and no matter how this goes I pay for at least one day I'm not watching the interweb (actually three.)
Here's where it gets a little confusing: I was not informed about needing to get my modem reset before canceling because they won't do it after because my satisfaction isn't their problem when I'm no longer a customer.

And when I discontinue service they won't undo the thing they did that makes my modem useless... how is this not criminal damage to property?! or at least some sort of petty vandalism?

The spicy miso ramen bowl I had was $14.25 and this did not count a seasoned egg or any other topping. 

Overall, I was really disappointed in this place. The ramen was good, the service good however I was really rubbed the wrong way with the way things are priced. For what you get it's truly not worth it. There are far better, more reasonably priced ramen restaurants out there.",0.0

The whole place is in a very woodsy area which is great for shade, and understandable about the spiders but I still think they should be swept off every morning. I also thought the bird cages were a little sad, pretty small and some werent easy to see the animals. (Most of the birds cant fly due to injuries so i get it) The eagle cage was a big let down.  Huge, beautiful birds but they were very far away. Theres a tiny little play area with natural wooden activities, which I love, but it was so blah.. again covered in spider webs, and just boring.

"Summary: Unacceptable service, overpriced booze, weak mixed drinks, and not nearly enough stations for playing games.

Long rant ahoy, fair warning.

I was pretty excited to come here for the first time after hearing some positive feedback from friends that went. Unfortunately it wasn't much of a positive experience at all.

Firstly, the service was very poor. The waitress was pretty prompt on asking for and delivering our first order, but it was all downhill from there. It took a very long time to be asked if I wanted another drink, so I went up to the bar and waited for about 20 minutes. Not even an acknowledgment. To be fair, it was very busy, but at least a ""be with you in a moment"" would have been nice. It also demonstrates a lack of proper staffing to handle the volume of customers.

Eventually, the same waitress came back and I placed another order for a beer. During this time I chatted with friends and played on the NES nearby. After about a half hour, no beer. My girlfriend politely asked if we could cancel the beer order and cash out, then the waitress said she left my beer on a nearby table out of view. She didn't bother to either hand me my beer or at least tell me that she brought it and set it on the table. Dangerous if someone wants to spike your drink. Once she came back with the check, she rudely asked my girlfriend if I was still drinking my beer or if she should throw it away. The beer was in my hand. :P 100% unacceptable attitude towards a customer, especially since we were nothing but polite to her despite our frustration.

Second, the drinks are lame. The beer was under poured to about 2\/3 of the cup. The cups were standard small plastic bar fare, about 8oz if I had to guess. No reason to under pour with cups that small outside of artificially getting more drink orders. 

As for the mixed drinks, my girlfriend got a Springfield, which was Simpson's themed and came with a donut. Nest concept and it tasted fine. However, there was barely any booze in it. She's a total lightweight due to gastric sleeve surgery and gets pretty drunk off of one glass of wine. She was stone cold sober after drinking all of it. Other people we spoke to had similar complaints.

Adding to it, the drinks are overpriced, even for Downtown. Two small draft beers and one weak mixed drink totaled $26.

Third, there weren't enough game stations for people to play. Its nice that you don't have to pay for bottle service to play them like the did at Insert Coins, but that also means people squat on them and play them without time limits. There are four stations for a room that fits about 200 people. 

All in all, a very disappointing and unacceptable experience.

I genuinely want this place to succeed both because I really like the theme and embrace of nerdy things in a bar (cosplayers, video games, music from nerdy games and movies, etc.), and because Neonopolis needs a big shot in the arm, but if these things aren't addressed, it's going to eventually wither and die just like Jillian's and the Drag Bar did before it.",0.0
"Prolouge: Maybe I'm jaded because I actually liked going to Copps across the street. It wasn't my favorite grocery store in Madison, but it was decent and easy to find things. Due to a commuting situation and needing to use the bus, I am sort of stuck with Hyvee. It's a pain that it's a longer walk from the bus stop, but oh well. It is what it is.

My actually review: I have serious mixed feelings about Hyvee. So we'll go with a classic pro\/con list.

Pros
-I like their ""restaurant\/buffet"" concept, even though I have only tried it once. Food was decent, and this type of thing is great for the lunch crowd. 
-Bakery is decent. Not thrilling, but taste and selection is pretty good for grocery store breads and pastries.
-Good selection for fancy cheese, meats, antipasto picnic fare
-Cleanliness
-Coupons in the Bucky Book
-They have hatch chili peppers when in season
-They employ people with disabilities and seem to promote them and treat them well
-Nice selection of bulk grains\/granolas
-Meat department decent quality
-Samples are fun!

Cons
-Non-organic lettuce selection is sad. Not many choices and little of each kind. Often not the freshest looking. 
-Produce arrangement with so many ""tables"" makes it hard to find things, and produce sales seem almost non-existent.
-What.is.with.the.layout of the store? Hard to find things and it doesn't flow great. I'm about 15 trips in, and I still get frustrated.
-Thin crust take and bake pizza steams in their foil pan. 
-Prices for things that aren't on sale seem high.
-Selection for some things really weirdly small, other things expansive
-Need more checkout lanes open. It's been at least three people deep every time I've gone, and it doesn't move fast.",0.0

"I've been to many DMV's in 4 states. The only DMV where the people working there were as unpleasant and rude was in Queens, NY! In between being impatient and seething with contempt some of the employees don't even look through paperwork properly. Beware they may try to send you home to get paperwork you've already brought! Because the work stations and seating is so packed tightly and the volume so loud from all the nearby talking and loudspeakers the employees feel much more comfortable yelling at people. I think the state needs to hire a masseuse to come rub these people's shoulders as they work!

The website asks you to fill out forms that when presented to the employee they'll tell you that you don't need.

The customer service is here is abysmal. One example, today I had a manager - who'd been asked by an employee to help her answer my question - carry on a casual, personal, conversation with what appeared to be the store manager five feet from me while I stood at the counter waiting to be helped for several minutes. The girl helping me had to take what I needed help with to the manager to interrupt her conversation in order to get an answer for me. Having worked my entire career in customer service, this is beyond inappropriate.

In addition to this, my girlfriend took her car in for a repair a couple of years ago as it was shaking when driven too fast and making an odd humming noise. They gave her a quote and worked on it for about an hour. When they returned the car, two new service lights were on and the car creaked loudly with every turn of the wheel - a new problem. Long store short, she had to take the car in and out of the garage four times in a 5 hour span, each time the mechanics giving her a different story - from not hearing the sound at all, to multiple versions of what was wrong with the car, to it actually being her fault that the car was making these new sounds - each time offering new quotes for what it would cost to fix the problems they had created. She asked to speak with the manager and after hearing her story, he proceeded to literally yell at her, talk over her, tell her she was in the wrong and that his mechanics had made no mistakes, even the ones they had admitted to, and tried to charge her to fix the mistakes they had made. The way that she was treated was, in short, abuse.

In order to replace the seal they would've had to crack the transmission. We brought the car home and immediately saw more oil leaks. We called them immediately. At this point they wanted another $700 to check it further. Little did they know that Angelina's Grandfather was an automobile technician at Sears for 20 years.

"We've been to the original Goldilocks in San Francisco, so we expected the same type of offerings (backed goods, sweets). We were excited to see a renovated restaurant, and a nice selection on the menu, but sadly --- the service fell short on all levels. 

Service: No one to greet us at the front of the house (everyone was busy by the bakery counter which was located on the other side of the restaurant). Half of the patrons dining, were either waiting for their food, looking around for service or had to flag someone down. There didn't appear to be a sense of urgency with the wait staff. We had to ask for menus, water. We ordered the sinigang jipon (shrimp), pancit lug lug, fresh lumpia and pinakbet. All arrived fresh and delectable (especially the sinigang), but the service was really lacking. No ""How is everything?"" ""Would your like dessert?"" It was a let down.

We did not have a repeat experience here. Wish I could tell you my servers name but we never got it, She poured my coffee and left a practically empty pot of coffee with me. We had to ask for water with lemon and then re-ask for lemons later on when she forgot them. We ordered the exact same thing of course, excited for our favorites . They came out looking familiar but slightly sad.  The lettuce in the salad was limp and you could barely find any chicken in it. The egg on my sandwich was fried to a crisp and seemed to have settled because by the time I had cut into it the yoke looked hard boiled. My arugula looked as if it had been dressed long before being place on my sandwich, the lemon which I usually love had wilted the oversaturated leaves.

Sushi - 2\/5 
I'm a fan of nigiri. They had a wide range of nigiris, rolls & even hand rolls made to order! But this is a review on the nigiri only... quality was ok. Not the freshest or best sushi I ever had, but it is a buffet. Can't expect too much... haven't tried the other sushi items so can't say much about it.

Hot food items - 4.5\/5
They had lots of hot food items. From made to order ramen, to tempura, roast beef & more. The selection was big! I liked pretty much everything. The food didn't taste bland at all. The winner was of course the snow crab legs!!!

"The service here is awful. Walked in and asked for a table for 5... the hostess didn't take my name and said to hold on 'right there' for a few minutes. I literally stood about 5 steps in front of the stand. After about 15 minutes I went up to her and she stated, ""oh I thought we seated you."" Then she took my name. We waited for about 15 more minutes and in that time one of the members of our party began feeling sick. He went to lay down in the car when they called our name. We stated that we had four people now - and they said they could no longer seat us because they had a 6-top... and we would require a 4-top. We did not want to be moved to the back of the list AGAIN, so we went to get our friend from the car. After about two minutes, our friend returned and when they brought us up to our table... we were at a four seater with an additional chair jammed into the corner.  This is after them telling us they could not seat us w\/ only four people because they reserved a larger table. We saw the larger table open and asked the hostess if we could move there and she said, 'she's just doing what they told her' and when someone in our party suggested we should leave after all this she said, 'that's fine' and walked away without saying anything further. We were left standing in the middle of the restaurant. We looked over the banister and saw they had moved on, seating other parties. It should also be noted that there were MANY MANY open tables. As we walked out, the manager saw us leaving and didn't say a word. A member of our party had to ask if he was the manager. As she told the manager what happened and he did not say sorry ONCE. I have been here before... and the food is good... but it is not worth the headache.

"Beyond disappointed by their horribly RUDE customer service. Who trained the staff here, monkeys? Went in around the evening time with my cousin to return a shirt, but decided to look around a little before leaving. The time was 9, thirty minutes before closing. Come 9:20 I overheard the woman working the fitting room scorning this woman for wanting to try on a few items she had. Her tone was ridiculously nasty and she even told the woman to immediately use the first fitting room and kept insisting her to just ""hurry up."" At this point, my cousin and I made our way up to the register, it still WASN'T 9:30. My cousin had stopped at the isle right BESIDE the register just to browse at some makeup quickly. When an older woman with short hair, whose name I didn't get, from behind the register told my cousin and I to immediately ""come on and pay"" because ""the lights were turning off in 5 minutes"" and ""it's already hard enough for me to see but worse when it's dark so come on"". Really? I get that you're an older woman who is probably cranky from working but 1) if you're unhappy there, leave, and 2) Common sense in customer service is to maintain a good face to the public and being respectful to all your customers despite YOUR issues. I think if your store still isn't technically closed, you have no right to immediately start treating your customers like shit and rudely rushing them out.

"The test of a breakfast place is how they cook over medium eggs. In my experience, three out of five places get it wrong and undercook them. Unfortunately, this place also got it wrong. They cooked over medium eggs like over easy eggs. Cooks take note: if the white of the eggs is still runny, it's not over medium, it's over easy. And gross! 

I don't know if the cooks don't know how to properly prepare an over medium egg or if they're just in too much of a hurry to do it right. What is interesting is that I've found that the independent, little diners tend to get it right more often that the chains.

I get when a restaurant doesn't choose to offer gluten free options, it's extra work for the kitchen and it's more expensive and that's fine.

Too much is riding on it.  32 Shea started offering gluten free bread for its sandwiches about a year ago and at first it was great!  The staff was careful and my beloved stacked turkey was fabulous!  Lately though, the bread has been burnt or so cold it's obvious my sandwich was made first and left to sit while the rest of the order was assembled.  The sandwich has been missing avocado or had lettuce I had requested left off.  Today was a deal breaker.  The kid at the cash register couldn't have been out of high school and although I asked him to repeat my order, it came out on regular bread (45 minutes after I ordered it!).  The person who brought it to me told me that the gluten free bread wasn't on the order, but she did take it back.

And this is why I am writing this review. Seriously Kelly what is wrong with you. I WILL get this corrected! ...like I don't have better things to do. You are a fraud and and a scam artist, and a really mean, aggressive person. 

I will be volunteering soon overseas with my church to help the impoverished with diabetes, foot conditions and other illness. I don't need this right now, but you have given me no other choice!

Unfortunately, the house we actually rented from her was falling apart with all kinds of problems. No wonder she pressured us so aggressively into purchasing it from her.

He never came back to ask how we liked the food or if we wanted anything else, dropping off the check without a word. He never thanked us for coming in. I won't eat there again.",0.0

My battery died in my car this morning. On my battery it specifically says free replacement within 2 years. The sticker on the car says September of 2015. That means my battery should still be replaced. Just had my car jumped and drove it to Tempe Nissan AutoNation. According to their paperwork my warranty expired yesterday.

"I waited until my second visit before reviewing because my first trip was opening weekend and I thought they would be working out the kinks. Getting a table is a nightmare. I expect a wait; it's Phoenix and that's just how it goes. What I don't expect is an hour and counting wait on a 20 - 25 estimate. There is also the issue of no real waiting area so people tend to wander and when they do call names it's right in front, so walk away at your own peril. They need to text or have pagers to cut down on the insanity. It's loud. When you have a place packed to the gills do you really need to play loud music in the background?  This just adds to the chaos. A breakfast\/brunch spot should be relaxing, not blood pressure raising. It's open and bright as seems to be the trendy thing. The food is good but not nirvanic. The servers are pleasant but the service is awful. There shouldn't be 15 to 20 plates on the pass waiting to go out. The Cook's push food out and it just sits there while the expectant diners are forced to watch it from afar.  Then when the food finally does move of the pass, it shouldn't repeatedly be delivered to tables and then taken back because it's not the right order.  This place should be so much more but it feels like the owner has little to no restaurant management experience based on the processes and doesn't seem to know what to do to improve things. Go somewhere else until they get their act together. The are too many other places out there to put yourself through Elly's.",0.0
So overpriced and lacking in any flavor.  I actually believe their dolmades are purchased pre-made because they taste and look identical to the dolmades I buy at the grocery store.  Without any alcohol and only a starter and two (tiny) entrees it was over $100.  Waste of money!,0.0

"Decided to try this place out with a friend to take our Halal Guys virginity and see what the hype was all about.

They have a pretty simple menu -- I opted for the combo platter which included chicken and beef gyro (because 2 in 1 for the same price, why not get your money's worth?) You order from the entrance side first then make your way across the assembly line to the cashier. Along the way, they ask if you'd like additional toppings, free of charge and sauces. The guy did not hear me clearly and added more of the infamous white sauce than I liked but I let it pass. I also found it hard to hear what the toppings were and could only see three toppings from the glass so he added olives and jalapeno. If he communicated that louder, I would have had that removed.

Anyways, my friend and I got our order and sat down as it wasn't too busy on a Monday afternoon. Although I got the combo, I would much rather get the chicken. The overall dish wasn't anything special. They're supposedly known for the white sauce but it didn't taste like anything. I didn't really get the hype.

"I like help when shopping but Men's Warehouse is really over the top. The selection of Men's clothes is nice and of high quality and definitely not the cheapest. Plan on spending at least one hundred dollars plus tax on a designer pair of jeans such as Lucky brand.

The store is not the biggest in size. However, there is a nice selection including the ability to order custom shirts and rent tuxedos for a party or wedding. 

On today's visit, I was helped by three different salesmen which wasn't really necessary considering I told them upon entering that I was just browsing. One of them offered his help in letting me know of the option of ordering custom tailored shirts. While this is a nice option, there is a four week delay prior to delivery to the store so you cannot need the shirt too soon!

"Worst hotel experience I've had. I usually take my kids to the Excalibur but we thought we'd try something new. I rarely write reviews, and this is my first hotel review, but this experience was beyond terrible. I booked the ""Deluxe Tower Premier Suite,"" thinking I'd give my kids a special treat. Firstly, the line to check in took 35 minutes, on a Sunday. Then we got to the suite and it looked NOTHING like the website picture. It looked liked it had not been updated since the 70s. The wallpaper was coming off the wall. The velvet couch had stains. The hall table had damage from drinks apparently. Worst of all, the Luxor website said it 'sleeps 3', but actually only had one bed. I had asked on the phone and when checking in if the couch folds out into a bed. They said yes. They lied. And the website is a lie. We went downstairs to change to a regular room. We had booked for 3 days but decided to cut it a day shorter, due to the rooms. I called within 24 hours notice to tell the front desk we'd leave the next day, and not two days later. They said I could not cancel the third day. I asked to speak to a manager. I explained to ""Damaras Costa"" the problem with the suite, and their website false advertising. Told her we would only stay 2 days, not 3. She became very rude, more rude than any service personnel I've ever experienced. Even after explaining everything very politely to her, she told me she would not let us check out, even with 24 hours notice. Regarding the suite, she told me ""We could have brought a portable cot to the room."" I asked her, ""So you want us to pay $700 for a cot."" Her tone was very rude and condescending. I told her the website is falsely advertising the suite as 3-person occupancy. She didn't believe me. I told her I'd email her the screenshot of the Luxor website, and I did. I then asked her to allow us to check out the next day. She still refused. I asked to speak to her manager. She said ""Just one minute. I want to check on something,"" and put me on hold. I waited for several minutes for Damaras Costa to come back on the phone, but it went dead. Apparently, this is her way of getting rid of customers requesting help. I called back. I again told her we would like to check out the next day, cutting the stay back from 3 days, and didn't want to be charged for a night we wouldn't be there for. I told her the hotel is committing fraud false advertising the suite. She finally said, ""Okay...it's not worth it. We are sold out anyway."" She finally agreed to let us check out the next day. In addition to all this, an iphone charger plugged into a lamp was stolen. The bathroom only had two towels (for a two-queen bed), the iron was broken, there wasn't any 'do not disturb' sign for the door, and the beds were lumpy. The only good part of the hotel was the Blue Man Group show, for the kids.  Terrible hotel and service.",0.0
If you're looking to rent a place I would recommend to LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. THIS PLACE IS AWFUL. Nothing gets resolved by the staff here at all.

"Hmmm.. I had pretty high expectations of this restaurant because my friends rave about it. The food is very good and all the standard hakka dishes quite excellent. I knock these guys down because of the bad customer service. Honestly, I felt like we were not welcomed at this restaurant.

Dining in a restaurant, I don't expect to have ass-kissing, but man, would really love it if decent respect is given to customers. Just be a human being and be nice! Why bother working in the service industry if you are there to be rude, give dirty looks, and treat customers like shit!

"We were coming out for a late dinner tonight and knew the restaurant would be closing at 2pm. As a courtesy to the restaurant, we called an hour ahead and told them we'd be arriving at 1:30, and asked if they would mind seating us and taking an immediate order. They said it was fine. So we drive across the city, excited to eat at one of our favorite restaurants, only to find out that they would not seat us once we arrived (30 minutes before closing time). We informed the hostess that we called and she said it was her that we talked to, to confirm the reservation. She then went on to to explain that they decided to close early because they changed their mind. They did not bother to call us back. They were unapologetic, and could care less that two loyal customers had just driven across the city to eat there. It felt like they just spit in our face. I'm familiar with the restaurant business so I know it's not just the hostesses fault, but management is to blame. I'm disgusted that any restaurant would do that to someone. SHAME ON YOU FIREFLY.

If you are going to Benihana MAKE SURE you go to the teppanyaki grill instead of the lounge because the lounge was no better than eating at Panda Express.  The 5 course meal ($31, in which i counted 4) included a soup which was good, the salad was subpar, the main course was cold and the desert was probably the best part and it was just ice cream.

The waiter was polite and looked like he was really busy even though the restaurant was nowhere close to being 30% so i guess they were understaffed.  Im guessing the chef prepared all of 5 courses at once the moment we placed our order because by the time we go to our main course it was cold, the dipping sauce for the steak was watery and not thick for it to stay on the food.

I was embarrassed because it was our 1st year anniversary and eating at Red Lobster the previous week was WAY better for around the same price.  Im never coming here again not even for the teppanyaki grill and i would rather go somewhere else, hell even Olive Garden runs circles around this place.  Ruth's Chris?

"Straight up a 3. No complaints about the food, but it's really nothing to write home about. Sandbar is much more a bar than a restaurant. To call it a Mexican restaurant is generous as the menu is very limited, with only the very basic Tex Mex items being offered.
Service was fair. Our waitress made no secret of the fact that she was very busy. Also, there was no host\/hostess, so we seated ourselves and just waited for a waitress to appear. She asked for our order when we didn't even have menus!

Prices are high for both food (very little choice) and drinks $5.50 for draft. Waitress was slow, had to be reminded to bring asked for items, no refills on water, had to ask for 2nd's on drinks, had to remind her desert came with offer and then waited till last race to get bill.  She even gave us two bills. One showing how much we would have paid and one that showed how much we owed with our discount coupon and reminding us to tip on the larger amount.

No matter how many times they would come in and spray for bugs we would get cockroaches and spiders.

"After seeing so many posts on IG about this place, I finally gave it a try. A very neutral experience. If you were thinking about Japanese fusion, this not very fusion at all. 

Service: 
The owner is very friendly and welcoming, not so much the others. The owner introduced us to their daily specials for the pineapple season, but I saw the ""special"" items are actually the same price on the regular menu. The servers mostly stood behind the counter and would only walk around when you ask them to come over. When one server brought the bill, she immediately left, so I had to call her back to give her payment. 

Food: 
We ordered the soft shell crab and avocado burger ($14) and the seafood omurice ($13) on the lunch menu. I wasn't aware that the burger would have spicy tartar sauce in it as I didn't read the fine print, I think they should've put some hot peppers beside the item name. I can't eat anything spicy so the burger wasn't very pleasant. The soft shell crab is very crunchy and freshly made. There was only a few pieces of avocado in the middle, not very noticeable. The bun is not the best - I would prefer a softer bun. Overall, I would give 3.5\/5 stars for the burger because I think if it wasn't for the spicy sauce, it would've been better. 

The seafood omurice was not what I expected. First off, omurice translates into ""rice omelette"". When the rice came, there was an omelette on top of the rice. Okay that's fine as I have seen versions where you can cut the centre and the egg would wrap the rice. When I cut open the centre, the egg didn't flow out. It looks like scrambled eggs on top of the rice. The also have no egg taste (maybe egg creations?). The rice is just steamed rice with some peas, carrots, and corn. There is also some tomato sauce on the side with the seafood. The sauce was like an Asian version of tomato sauce of spaghetti - nothing special. The seafood included shrimp, clams, and octopus. The shrimp wasn't bad, but the clams were terrible. The clams were extremely overcooked - very chewy and had no taste. I can't say for the octopus as I don't like it in general. I think for $13 there should be a little more variety (ex. mussels, crab meat, fish). Overall 2\/5 stars. 

Overall, I didn't really feel any Japanese fusion taste at all. It's more like Chinese and Western fusion. This is probably a one-time thing for me.",0.0

"We decided to eat lunch here for a friend's birthday, and the second we walked in the waitress on at the time seemed as if we were a nuisance. Throughout our meal there, she acted as if she had better things to do than wait on us even though the entire restaurant was empty except for me and my friends. The one sandwich my friend ordered took 10 minutes longer to come out than the rest of the food , even though we saw it had already been prepared and was sitting on the back shelf of the kitchen. The waitress who was just standing in the kitchen talking to the staff, and occasionally waking out to check on the restaurant only brought the sandwich to my friend once we asked her if i was still being made. Then once we were ready to leave, we tipped her (even though we shouldn't have for how rude she was) and she acted as if she wanted us to leave. Not once did we do anything to make her angry. Absolutely awful. Will never go back again because of that woman.",0.0

I couldn't even taste the rest of my meal as that took my taste buds off the chart.

"I was at your restaurant recently and I think this will be my last time. I work in customer service so I try to give leniency to staff when it's busy. There were two wait staff, but even when it wasn't busy, it was impossible to get their attention. First, our waitress forgot to punch in our appetizers even after we mentioned it to the manager when he dropped off the wings. We waited over an hour for our appetizers. When I dipped my chip in the spinach dip, I found a plastic foil (the size of a store-bought tub of spinach dip) inside the dip! Great, now I know how you really prepared this dip. We speak to the manager, send it back, and simply ask it to be taken off the bill - we didn't want a second remade order of that. When we finish our mediocre meal with ridiculously inattentive service, we ask for the bill. Firstly, the spinach dip wasn't taken off. The server takes the receipt back before I could check the rest. She comes back and I find that the half price wings was only applied to 3 orders, not 4 despite ordering 4 drinks. I get her attention after 10 minutes of waving her down and explain the situation. She says she will fix it. 15 minutes later, she hasn't fixed it. She walks by the table and tells me the manager will be with us shortly. I wait patiently. 15 more minutes have passed and the manager seems to have no intention of coming to see us. I walk up to the manager to explain the situation to him and he had no idea about the problem! Zero communication between the staff and the manager!! I tell him that we don't want to wait for him to fix it any longer. I've calculated what the bill should be and prepared the exact amount of money we owe. I hand it to him and tell him to fix the bill on his own time. I'm not waiting any longer. And then I left. 

I tried. I really tried to be patient and understanding. I even tipped them a little because I understand that it was busier than they have probably expected. But the quality of my food was not good enough for me to dismiss the quality of my experience. At no point did the manager take control of my frustration to offer me a discount for my troubles. At no point did I feel understood that my time is important too. We dined for over 2 hours when it could've been just 1, and mind you, with a toddler and an infant. I'm sure the staff were genuinely nice people that simply lacked training. But unfortunately, I don't think I will be returning to any wild wings because of how the food might have been prepared.",0.0
Been really wanting the try pho. Ready a couple review and this place seamed to have the best reviews for mesa. Place was very clean and  simple. I ordered the #28 that's what the waiter recommend. The restaurant was packed so I was really surprised at how fast the food came out. I would say it was within 10min. I really wanted to try oxtail but that was not an option on the menu so I was a little disappointed. I felt like it was really American and not truly authentic. It had a nice sweet taste to it. Meat was tender. I like the Basile leaves they give you to put in the soup really tops off the flavore. I was just expecting more condiments to come with it. After my food was brought out I never saw the server agen till I waved some one down to get my check. Was a cool place to try happy I did I just wouldn't come back agen.,0.0

Plus the decor then was old world vegas, with nice wrap around booths and low lighting. Truly an authentic experience and worth the price of admission. Now, sadly when you go to the buffet lines guys are standing around with hairnets on their beards and talking about strip clubs when your getting your overcooked lobster tail lol.

"TLDR - They do not provide kind or compassionate care. They might hide risks from you.  They advocate for unnecessary procedures.  They get defensive and fight with you after the birth.

I gave birth in February. I finally decided that I needed to post about my experience in hopes that it helps someone else avoid the terrible care I received.

Policy wise - The biggest policy I dislike is that they refuse to see you within 24 hours of giving birth.  Two of my Facebook friends confirmed this after the fact - one used midwives and the other the ob-gyns so it is a consistent policy across MomDoc.  If you have a cesarean and want post-op healthcare and advice you won't get it for a while.  Robyn did see me 30 hours later but then she snapped at me.  She did not give me any useful aftercare information.  The nurses kept asking if my provider had seen me during the first day.  Other medical practices will apparently help you afterwards, I suggest that you go to them instead of MomDoc.

Two of the three midwives at the hospital were awful.  If Melissa is still working, do not go to this place. During my induction, the nurses would not give me any medicine to induce after a certain point because my son was struggling on the monitor.  His heartbeat would drop below 110 and slowly come up.  I asked Melissa how my labor was progressing.  She told me not to worry that I was having a normal labor for someone who had an old placenta.  What does that mean? She left while I was confused.  How does normal labor progress in this situation? I knew that old placenta was weird ""casual"" language for placenta insufficiency or that my placenta was not giving enough nutrients.  What I did not know was what that meant for my birth.
My husband followed her a few times to try to get answered.  He caught her playing games on her phone in the hallway.  That was back when we still wanted to talk to her.
Later, Melissa advocated for different procedures - one of which was stripping the membranes.  I knew the research was mix and also that it was uncomfortable. I asked Melissa if it would help with my son's situation.  She said no.  I asked ""why would we do then?"" She gave some reasons that sounded knowledgeable. I said in relief ""It does help then"".  She said No.  I was thoroughly confused.  I only did it because my nurse said she had seen it help make labor go quickly.  Melissa did it.  It was one of the worst moments of my labor (I did experience harder contractions later).  I remembering screaming and arching my back to try to get away from her.  Melissa performed an unnecessary and painful procedure on me that she not even think was helpful. 

I remembering feel so powerless and confused.  She was honest when I asked, but still was advising me to do what she considered unnecessary procedures. After that, I did not want her around me because I could not trust her.

I was relieved when we decided to do the c-section.  I had been worried about my son's health for hours.  I remember feeling comfortable (but way out of it) during prep because they played music I liked.  When I was still open and right before they got my baby to touch my face, I heard Melissa say ""This is thickest meconium that I've have ever seen.""   This made me extremely uncomfortable while I was waiting to feel my son.  I still don't understand why she felt like she need to comment about my body while still sewing me up or at all for that matter?

This review is getting long. When Robyn finally showed up 30 hours after my c-section, I asked her what went wrong.  I thought it was placenta insufficiency but Melissa was saying that and she had shown she was not to be trusted. Robyn snapped at me that I had an OLD PLACENTA.  She woke up my husband.  She then told me that a second to last ultrasound had shown this was probably happening.  Again what?  Why was I told risk factors about my labor after the fact?  When I had that ultrasound, Ramona had made me feel comfortable because we had passed the non-stress test beautifully.",0.0

"NEVER AGAIN. Yesterday was our son's 6th birthday party and it was a nightmare. It cost us several hundred dollars.  My was supposed to get a shirt as his gift. Well they were out of the normal kids sizes and were like ""oh well."" They gave us seating for 12 people when I paid for 35 guests. They gave me an attitude when I asked for more seating. They gave us one table for our gifts, gift bags, cake, and food. The gifts ended up on the floor. There was no table for the pizza we paid for. When I asked them where we were supposed to put the pizza, I got the biggest attitude from the staff. I literally had to ask my guests to stand up and take away one of the few tables we had to put a stack of pizza boxes on it. The staff was incredibly rude the entire time. They gave us 8 forks for our guests and a few plates and napkins. We had to ask 4 times for more plates. Luckily I brought our own utensils. There were at least four other birthday parties going on simultaneously and the other parties had two tables for their cake and food and when I asked why we only had one, the guy working there flipped out on me. We were crammed in between two other parties and the people from the other parties were leaning on our food table and eating our food. A few of my guests had to stand the entire time and people ended up leaving early because it was such a disaster. I can't stress enough how rude the staff was and how they made us feel like we were bothering them by asking for seating, a place for the food and plates and utensils.

Then, about two days or so later, I get a voicemail from the person who drew my blood that they actually misplaced my blood samples, and id have to come in again to draw more blood. Um, what? You lost my blood? I received a huge ugly bruise for nothing? Really made me wary to come back in... but again this place is close to home, so I left work early (again) and came in and stated I was back again since my blood sample was misplaced. I was able to avoid a long wait due to the accident which was okay, but once I sat down the Asian woman who was drawing my blood now noticed the huge bruise on my left arm. She clicked her tongue and told me I didn't have ""the vein"" by looking over my arms and told me the top of my hand would have to do. This worried me never having my blood drawn by my hand before, I asked her if it hurt more and she replied, ""well, you don't have the vein so...""....very reassuring. Once she put it into the top of my hand, she kept wiggling the needle inside and telling me to stop tensing up and to relax. I noticed not a lot of blood was coming out and the pain was intense to say the least... after a while she removed the needle, told me to put pressure on it and told me I just couldn't relax enough. I have to admit it was very hard to.

"The 1 star  for our waitress and our waitress ONLY. She was still training . So we had some compassion for her.

We have come here twice before but the service and food has always been mediocre. Its been about 8 months since our last visit so we decided to give it a go because of location convenience Came in this morning, ordered a kids breakfast and two adult breakfasts. My side dish of eggs and bacon, they eggs were WAY smaller than the kids eggs. Found that odd. They also forgot to put the cheese on them. Mentioned it to our server and she offered to have it fixed and I declined since we were on a time schedule because my husband was having breakfast with us on his work lunch break. I go to pick up a piece of my bacon and there is hair on it.... I also noticed the cook having a long beard and instead of them making him shave it due to health violations and cleanliness and professionalism, they made him wear a net over it ..... really?

Our waitress was very apologetic. They removed the $4.50 side plate. Hair in someone's food is disgusting and should absolutely never ever happen. The fact that the manager sent her back with a $5 coupon and our discount check, and he didn't even have not only the balls or the respect to come over and apologize to us shows their lack of care and customer service. But really, what would he say? There's no excuse for hair in someone's food because the bottom line is that is a result of the not so cleanliness of their kitchen. And as a server myself it's just unacceptable the lack of customer service as well. 1 stars for our server being sweet and professional, I feel bad that her manager had no balls and made her continuously apologize to us. We gave our coupon to the table over. I will also be notifying the health district . As well as never returning

"My wife and I are extremely disappointed with our recent experience. We recently came across an Open Door listing for a home that we absolutely fell in love with. It had been on the market for nearly four months and had fallen out of contract already once before. It was listed at 192. We tried to make a contingency offer for the full price and were told that they would not accept contingency offers. The very next day they lowered the price to 190 (which was a confusing business strategy, but hey, good for us). The day after that my wife and I received and offer on our home which we accepted. We then turned around and tried to make what we thought was a sure bet strong contingency offer for again the full price, this time at 190. We were told that we would have to make it through the inspection of our home before they would consider our offer. We were not able to get the inspection done on our home for a couple of days and literally on the same day that we were supposed to have the inspection the Open Door home went under contract for 182. If I were in charge at Open Door I would take a long and close look into my standard operating procedures that just cost me $10,000.",0.0

6:50pm, Check-in was efficient, no line, but there isn't much direction as to where to go once you enter. Maybe because the Christmas tree was in the way?

It's obvious they forgot to serve our dessert because they cleared our entrees as soon as we set our forks down, but never set the dessert utensils until we mentioned we were still waiting.

"LA Fitness is fine. As long as you never have to make a request, make a complaint, ask for a manager, deal with the hordes of people, go into the hot tub, look for some paper towels, face a broken machine, bring anyone in on a guest pass, cancel your membership...yeah, other than that, it's fine. 

Disclaimer, I've never been to a class (though they must be good because they're always super popular), and I've never used the pool. At $40\/month + $100 initiation, this was probably one of the cheapest places I could to go considering I only really need access to the gym and its equipment. 

Yes, it's big. Half of it is filled with Ellipticals and Stairmasters, for the cardio enthusiasts and the ""Yeah, I go to the gym all the time"" declarers who are there to lightly walk and watch dramas\/take selfies. The other half is filled with equipment, for those that want to do some strength building exercises and the hardcore roid bros. I once saw two roid bros have a face off at the chest press machines, adding more and more weight and looking redder and angrier.

The equipment is brand new but when something breaks...oh well! That's going to stay broken for at least 3 weeks. Same with the hot tub. And the sauna. Bathrooms have also been getting progressively dirtier. Paper towel dispensers are usually empty. Is that management's fault? Probably. Staff do seem to be notoriously unhelpful. Luckily, I'm a very easy customer and have never had to approach staff for anything but I've had family and friends alike tell me of their incompetence and downright rudeness.

That's not to say staff are annoyingly indifferent all the time, they COULD be super nice...if you're about to join the place or make a large purchase, like for personal training sessions. There are definitely some qualified trainers there, but also some that are questionably qualified. As in, they're probably not qualified at all. If you're considering the investment, make sure you shop around. 

While signing up to give your money away, that process still isn't a smooth as you'd like it to be. To get access to the gym, they encourage you to download their app. In order to login to their app, you need to receive a membership code from the front desk. 9\/10 times, they gave me the wrong code. Bringing in a friend on the guest pass isn't a simple procedure either. Need to take pictures and take ID like it's some sorta government application, damn.

And lastly, cancelling your membership. After being a hassle-free stream of revenue ever since the gym opened, you finally decide for certain reasons, you gotta go. Thanks for your loyalty, here's the most inconvenient cancellation policy for ya. You can only cancel in person from 9am-5pm from Monday to Friday. Gosh! What a coincidence! Those are exactly the same hours I'm at work! Sure, there are other ways, you can print a specific template from their website (which also requires that stupid membership code) and mail it to headquarters in California...

There you have it. That is an accumulation of my 3 years at LA Fitness from start to finish. Bottom line is, it's fine as a no frills gym but they market themselves as one with frills, and the frills is where they fail. Cheap option to get some gains. Too cheap for you to gain anything beyond that. Goodbye LA, you'll always be remembered in my heart as ""just ok"".

Comes 12:30 and still no tech so call the office again and after looking up our work order they said they are still within the window. 12:45 tile installers are now close to the area where the tech has to work so I call again and I was told they have the tech call me. 12:55 tile guys are about to start working in the laundry room where they leak is so I called and ask the office to reschedule. She looked up the order and rescheduled us for Saturday. 
Few minutes later my wife calls me and says home warranty called them to say the plumbing tech showed up and there was no water so they couldn't inspect the issue ?! What ?!!! Sure I had the water shut off because of the leak but how did they come in without me being aware 6 feet away ?!

One night while chatting with a friendly dealer, long story short.... she finds out my husband and I and other friends are frequents stayers & table players here at GN going on 5 years. So she asked who was my GN host. I told her, don't have one. She said ""What??? Why????"". Folder ""Don't know."" She asked if I was ever introduced one.... I said ""No"". She asked if I wanted to meet one I said ""OK."" After 20 minutes, this young guys comes up to the table , the dealer introduces me to him as Matt.

"I unfortunately do not recommend this attorney's office. I hired them last summer for an HOA matter and while the rates were very reasonable, I am afraid that was because they do not have enough time for their workload. I initially checked in rarely but did not get any response by email. I checked in more frequently but still did not get any email answered or messages returned.  There have been tens of emails with no response or acknowledgement back over the past two years.  I had to start really calling frequently to get the attorney on the line.  This worked better, and he has always very friendly and accommodating by phone but then few if any of the timeframes he set for motions or responses to me after the phone call were met on time.  He would always say he would get something to me and then nothing for honestly months until I called again.  I finally was able to get some cycles one year ago because of court deadlines, an active garnishment, and looking to switch to another attorney, but it was pulling teeth and as soon as the urgency and that phase was done I have since been waiting for 1 FULL YEAR to file in court for recovery of extra money taken and violations of the debt act as Roger said he would do last January.  I am also concerned because most recently Roger said he did file, but the case does not show up and he never allowed me to review it and will not send a copy so I fear he misled me.  I am not the only one, as the attorney was suspended by the Arizona State Bar in 2015 for a month during the time my case was starting. I have just commenced a complaint as well because even though I do not wish more difficulty on the attorney, I really cannot get a response.

Evidently.... plenty. First off the, the location. Easy to find. Right be great food as aforementioned. Cute little space inside. Bright and vivid and a big fan of the pop art. Like many places, they had simple board games as well. 

Menu choices is the first drawback. You at first think it is a lot, but once you look at menu it isn't that many different flavor options.  Outside the drinks, they have ice cream as well as donuts.

"Do NOT go to this salon if you are requesting any sort of complex color!!! I made an appointment based on Yelp reviews and this was a MAJOR mistake! I recently moved to the area and previously had my old hair dresser do balayage\/ombré. She knew going in I already had this hairstyle. I will admit that my hair was grown out because of moving\/lack of hairdresser. Natalia refused to do my color because she didn't feel comfortable and didn't want an ""experiment"". Her excuse was that she didn't know the formula that my old hair dresser used for the brown and because the brown was an artificial color... she didn't know how the blonde (the blonde needed to be moved up into the brown because of growth) was going to pull and toner will wash out. She would like to see ""virgin"" hair or have done it herself (she never wants new clients?) to feel comfortable on the correct formula. She even asked me to call my old hairdresser (actually... she called my old hairdresser my ""friend""... like I did it at home with a friend) to see what she did!!!! Was it semi permanent, Demi, permanent... What!? You are supposed to be a professional hairdresser!? I asked what she felt comfortable doing and she looked at me blankly and didn't have a logical answer. What I can respect is the honesty but I was in disbelief! What do you even say in response!? Um... I respect your honest, get me the heck out of here before I cry? I came home crying to my husband because of how awful she made me feel about myself and hair. I just moved here 4 months ago and this was my first experience with a hairdresser... feeling ashamed and down. My husband called every salon in the area until he found an appointment for me 2 hrs after this mess. Thank god he did because the true professional hairdresser he found didn't bat an eye (I didn't tell her the unprofessional mess I went through the hour before) and guess what?

"After ten days of dealing with phone problems affecting my quality of yelping and being on vacation I had been on a review writing hiatus. So, I'll end the ten day review writing hiatus by reviewing the Palm's McDonald's. 

  Although this is a new listing, other Yelpers have photographed this location and wrote about it under the listing for the McDonald's down the street at 4945 West Flamingo Road. The current map for this business listing actually shows this location. There is some confusion between the two locations that caused me to check in to 4945 West Flamingo Road twice. Hopefully this listing puts the confusion to rest. 

  Anyhows, after I ended my stay at the Rio and checked out of the hotel, I walked through the nearby hotels that included the Palms. I was up to eating something light that would hold me over til dinner. In the back of my mind, I remembered a new sandwich that McDonald's recently released called the Grand Big Mac. What a concept! Take the Big Mac and turn it into a humongous Big Mac. It just surprises me that it took McDonald's fifty years to think of it. 

  At 12:31 pm on March 23, I walked into Palm's Food Court named The Eatery and towards the McDonald's. There in front of me on the changing digital menu I laid eyes on the Grand Big Mac. In a few minutes I exchanged $8.21 (after taxes) for the Grand Big Mac Value Meal. Immediately afterward, the friendly cashier presented  me with a medium soda cup that I filled up with Coke from the adjacent fountain. 

   Even on a Thursday afternoon, the Eatery Food Court was nearly full. I was left to walk with my tray to the other end of the food court to find a lone vacant table. Once I got to the table, it was covered by a tray holding a Grand Big Mac, medium fries, and drink.

Unfortunately our service was sub par. I don't want to completely call out our server on here but her name started with ""R"". Our group was mellow- a few alcoholic drinks, and not everyone ordered food. After ordering the drinks she told us when she came back we would ""talk food"". The drinks took 15+ minutes, and when she came back she didn't stop long enough to take anyone's order. We waited another 10 minutes to order, while she walked around and helped the neighboring tables. Finally she took orders and the food took a decent amount of time. Truthfully it was just disappointing- there was no reason a couple Sangrias( red and white were delicious) and a beer should take that long. Also I don't know why she continued to not make taking 12 peoples orders a priority.

"Fridays has gone down. The food used to be good. This place was extra crowed and hot. Everybody looked hot and mad when you walked in. The host\/greeter was over it. He didn't smile nor was enthused to be there. Nobody said hello or appeared friendly luckily I'm an aggressive and demanding type of person and don't wait around. Although it was busy and extra crowded does not excuse lack of customer service I think when it's busy your and take the time to care is when service counts the most. Don't just treat people anyway because you're busy learn how to work under pressure. This place was packed like every table was taken people were waiting inside and outside. The food was nasty. The chicken was dry, the broccoli was stale and they forgot what I asked for and paid for. I won't be returning to this location due to bad service and I don't like the food. I had to throw it away.

Southwest is never on time and they are frequently late departing. I am sitting on the runway in Vegas and our flight has been delayed over an hour.

"Contacted Scottsdale Air and Heating for an estimate. They said someone would get back to me but when they hadn't after four days I called again. They connected me to Steve V who set a day to come out and give me an estimate. Steve came and I discussed that I needed the duct work moved in my single level two HVAC zone house. Both zones cooled the main room and the thermostats were in the main hall on opposite ends. I stated I wanted to separate the house into two zones with one HVAC unit cooling the the master bed\/bath and spare bed\/bath. Steve told me that the issue was I had to small a unit for my house and that I needed to spend $17,000.00 to install an entire new system. He also told me that how I wanted the duct work laid in the attic was not possible due to the construction of the house. Steve verbally quoted me the 17 K and said he would send a formal email quote in a few days. I asked him to also quote me with my request about moving the ducts and the thermostat. Three weeks passed and I never received the quote. I call Steve on the his cell and asked if he sent the quote and he states he hadn't had time to get around to it but said I'd have it in a few days. Quote never came and by then I had a second contractor give me an estimate. The house was custom build and we had purchased it a few months prior, the previous owners had larger than needed HVAC installed to accommodate a possible future addition. The home inspector also stated at the time of purchase that the HVAC units were more than adequate. We contact another HVAC contract (see other post) who came out to give us an estimate. They apologized on behalf of Scottsdale Air and Heat and said we had more compacity than we needed and that the thermostat and some duct work needed to be added, rerouted\/relocated to optimize the systems. They did the job and the units work amazing now. Scottsdale Air obviously only wants the work if they can get a high dollar bill. I would assume many others have fallen victim to this company.",0.0
"L&L is a great place to eat, but the service that this specific location today was AWFUL. I called in a pick up order and when I was talking to the lady on the phone, it seems as though she was rushed and wasn't paying attention to my order and was very sarcastic and rude. 10 minutes later, I arrive to pick up my food. I asked her if I could double check if there's all Mac salad, which is what I ordered over the phone, and she said ""it's already packed up here you go"" and again I said ""is there all Mac salad"" she said ""no we already made your order, here you go."" I asked her if she could make it correct and she ignored me and told me the price of my meal. COMPLETELY RUDE! If you're going to work in customer service especially a restaurant, BE KIND.

Have to say this show is extremely disappointing.  The guys appear to look like twenty year olds and weigh 150lbs at best. They have ripped bodies but really look scrawny.  Not a lot of dancing going on and they have their clothes on for a lot of the show.  The MC is a girl whom we can do without seeing or hearing about unicorns and her dream.  The venue is very cool and setup well.  The waiters are very attentive.  The show itself though is not all that.  The main character Mike is not attractive whatsoever.

"My experience here didn't even meet my lowest expectations.

I purchased a truck in 2014. The ""no-haggle price"" on the window was about $3k less than what they ended up charging me on the price. I would have walked out, but after half a day there, my wife was too exhausted to endure another car-buying experience. 

My problems with this company didn't end there. The truck's key became unprogrammed about once every six months. Time and again, I would get stranded, have to order a tow truck and would lose the use of my vehicle for 2 days while they tinkered with the keys.

About three months ago they key became disabled again, except this time my warranty was expired. This time it was my wife who got stranded. I sent a polite email to the service department and asked them to please disable the anti-theft system if they weren't able to permanently fix the problem with the keys. They never even bothered to reply.

The crust was fine, not too thick, not too thin, and crunchy. I did have a decent sized air bubble in the sausage slice, which I'm not a fan of. The toppings were ok, the breading was decent on the eggplant with a little bit of crunch. The sausage was cut into really thick slices, it was pretty  good. 

However, where this pizza dies is the sauce. On their wall, they boast the Sauce is the Boss. Well if this sauce was my boss, I'd have quit my job. It was a dark red, it tasted like old burnt tomato. No herbs, no spices, there was nothing about it that resembled pizza sauce at all.

"Overpriced poor quality sushi. I love the Scottsdale Sushi Brokers.. this one sucked.
Small rolls. Small cuts of sashimi. The cuts of steak on the surf and turf were much smaller than I typically get. They tried to disguise the undersized roll and steak under a pile of onions, which were good. The steak actually seemed boiled it was so rubbery. I mentioned this to our server and he just laughed it off and said he was sorry. I expect to spend $$$ on good sushi . $64 for a 12 pc sashimi and 2 rolls with 2 waters seemed excessive for the poor quality.  The other roll with lobster dynamite was delicious.

"I'm actually a bit disappointed with our stay at the Venetians Hotel (5 Stars). I guess I was expecting perfect customer services and friendliness. From the photos the Venetians hotel was perfect (5 Stars). The only hotel with All the Room Suite starting at 650Sq Feet. Perfect shoppings experiences, dining and experiences too. I was over joyed staying there. The beautiful Venetians Suite 750 Sq. Feet Suite. We were greeted, opened door by the staff when we walked in. It was absolutely breath taking Venetians interior, decors and exterior s too. 

Unfortunately the not so perfect rating was for the male front desk checked us in. It was not Welcome with our small unfriendly conversations. I was tired and did not appreciate the bad customer service and negative talked too. It was unfortunate, but I had to asked for Room upgrade? It was supposed to be a courtesy for the hotel staff to asked the customer for room upgrades. But he made it sound like I was asking and looking me weird (like I did something wrong too?!?). But we eventually received a room upgrade with a view. It was really important to me with a great view too.

Our Suites was amazing 750 Sq. Feet Venetians. It was spectacular. We loved our bedroom suites. I called late at night for extra bathrooms Amenities. The services was quick, friendly and helpful too. He was great.

It tasted like it had been made a week prior and microwaved. 

The starter was their ""signature maftoul"" which was beyond strange. It was beef wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper smothered in a heavy chipotle mayo--nothing morrocan about it. It had no redeeming qualities. My girlfriend had the hummus which wasn't too bad and came with really tasty olives.

"Interesting concept. Came with a bunch of coworkers for lunch. Wide open warehouse with food stalls. Each one is order\/pay separate. While it looks like a place that would cater to the local work lunch crowd, at 11:30 on a Wednesday it was dead and many of the stalls had closed signs. It would also be nice if there was someone or maybe a sign to explain the concept and what there was. Didn't really want to wander around to much and figure it out or why nothing was open. We all grabbed food from different places. I got curry noodles from the latin\/asian place. They didn't have many drink sections, looked like coke bottles, green tea cans and bottled water. Each place had different selections so you would have to pay at a different place if you wanted something different to drink what they had. The burger place was open and most people ordered from there. The burgers looked good but the fries that I snagged from my coworker were not good, I really didn't know fries could be bad but it was almost like they were hollow. It was odd. Lunch for a noodle bowl with some veggies and 3 shrimp was a little prices. around $18 for the ice tea and small bowl.

Because there are so many dealers, the prices ranged from stupid ridiculous to very reasonable.  The outside area of the mall had some interesting items. I wish it hadn't been 120 degrees out because I would have liked to spend more time out there. Maybe if I go back when it's cooler, browse longer out there, I'll update my review.

"I really wanted to like this place. I have used Yelp as a fairly credible resource in the past and this place had great reviews. New to the area, I came to Ish to get my hair cut and styled. The person I originally scheduled with had to cancel, but I went in and got a cut and style with another stylist. Shortly after, I returned to the salon because I was not satisfied with how the layers were falling in my long hair. I wanted them blended more. When I called to schedule the corrective cut, I was told that the owner could fit me in later in the week. I was very grateful. However, when I arrived, I was not in the books, but he did squeeze me in before his next appointment. We went over what needed amending and I felt heard. He was very friendly (so was the rest of the staff)  and the atmosphere was pleasant. His next client came, however, and I could feel the urgency to finish with my cut\/style. 

From here, I am honestly not sure what happened, but I left the salon with what is the worst haircut since my childhood. Though the layers were now blended in the back, a far worse problem was created. My front left side was SEVERELY uneven (see pictures). It's as if the scissors slipped and a huge chunk was cut out. When I saw my hair before I left, I was in shock and hopeful that it was just a wave\/curl that was making things so uneven. 

I was extremely upset and could not bring myself to go in for a THIRD time. Ultimately, I had to find another salon (where I will go from now on) and pay full price for yet another haircut and style. Much to my despair, I have lost at least three and a half inches total off my length and paid for two haircuts. Again, though everyone was very nice, the final result and lack of professionalism are unacceptable. I am only writing this review with the hope that someone else can be spared from a mishap this large and costly.",0.0

"They're pretty stuffy here. The waiters are a bit arrogant. Some of the food was good. The fettuccini with mushrooms- super bland. Waste of a dish.

"It was my second time here today.  I had Salmon Kabobs the first time and they were good. The pieces of salmon were a decent size and tasty.  This time I tried the Tossed Greek Salad.  First of all, the chicken was almost non-existent.  My salad only had a few small, dry pieces of chicken in it.  Probably the same small chicken pieces that my husband and son were eating.  They had ordered the Chicken Kabobs.  My husband has had the Chicken Kabobs before and said that the pieces were not that small and dry before.  But back to my salad...
I really have an issue with their signature Zoe's Dressing, it doesn't have a lot of flavor.  If you use the bottle on the table, you have to shake it up well and there still isn't that much flavor.  My salad was tossed in it and all I could taste was lettuce so I asked for a side of their Lemon Vinaigrette and that helped with the overall flavor.  The Tossed Greek Salad is served with a small bowl of pasta salad.  That was just ok, nothing special.  

I really want to like Zoes because it's close to my house and it's healthier than some other options.  They also have a big menu using their main proteins in every possible way.  My son was hoping for some Gyros since it is a Mediterranean place but that is one protein that is not on the menu.",0.0
"This place was alright. I was really excited and was really looking forward to dining here. We didn't have the friendliest greeting and the food was okay. We ordered the Bang Bang Shrimp for starters which was pretty good. We were offered bread and pesto but didn't get it until our salad came. I couldn't even tell you if the bread and pesto was good or not because there was hair on the plate. 
We ordered the Bonefish House Salad, if you don't like olives than this salad is not for you. I like olives so to me, it was pretty good! I for my main course I ordered the Tilapia Imperial with sautéed spinach and garlic mash as my side and my date ordered 6oz Filet medium, garlic mash and steamed broccoli for sides. 
I'll start off with the tilapia, it started off extremely dry around the edges and was pretty good towards the middle of the fish. The entire entree was really bland. The filet was really bland. The broccoli was over cooked... I don't know... This place was a disappointment. For desert we have the chocolate crème brûlée and it was delicious. Everything else was okay and the service was okay. Probably won't be back. Didn't go to the restroom... can't judge them on that. The moscato is good!",0.0

"I went in with high expectations since this place is a Montreal institution, and of course I ordered the Smoked Meat Sandwich since it's what they are known for. I really wanted to like this place but it just fell short. 

Overall, the sandwich was just okay. Luckily I did not wait long to get seated, however, if the line were any longer I'd say it wouldn't be worth it. The flavor of the smoked meat was very tasty, it's less peppery than the American pastrami and more mild, which I liked. My one complaint about the meat is that it was sliced too thick which made it tougher to eat (I prefer thin sliced). The bread was pretty standard and a little too soft because it fell apart easily as I bit into the sandwich. I also highly recommend that you order the dill pickle or coleslaw (which is vinegar based) to accompany your sandwich to cut through the fattiness of the meat.

The highlight of our meal was the fast, efficient, and friendly service. Make sure you bring plenty of Canadian currency because this place is CASH ONLY. They will let you use American currency but you will be charged extra. I'm glad I got the chance to check this place out......but I probably will not be going back for more.",0.0

"This place is mediocre at best. The decor is great and the service was wonderful, that's the only reason I am giving them 3 stars. We should have heeded the red flags as this place had maybe 5 tables occupied,but we were hungry and though a bite from the grill and a roll would suffice. We were wrong. 
The king crab skewer was NOT fresh. They try to compensate with the butter,but when it comes to seafood it's hard to make up for that. I would expect that At a low end buffet offering, but here? 
As for the sushi, we only tried some rolls, but considering that one was labeled as the house specialty, we expected decent. Nothing special here, you are better off in a strip mall. Keep in mind this is only for the rolls and the few pieces of fish that were present were good. For example, I. Their Philly offering, the cream cheese should be an additional component, to add a texture not be the main element and compensate for the lack of anything else. 
Considering price and location we expect smaller portions and at least above minimum quality.  I am not picky, but this just disappointed me enough that I feel I should leave a review.

"I wanted to love this new, vibrant restaurant that Old Montreal has added to its rich repertoire, but...

Both my ""little plate"" and main course arrived to my table in the wrong serving temperature. 

*My plate of seared New Brunswick scallops with the lime dressing was well executed and very tasty, but lost its warmth by the time I received it. Did it wait around too long while the chef(s) was (were) preparing the other orders for my 3 guests? If so, why wasn't it made last as the other orders were mostly cold salads or at least kept warm?

*My ""brown-butter lobster rolls"" (rather one long roll) consisted of a cold bun that suspiciously seemed pre-refrigerated. The lobster inside was perfect, but also cold.

What goes on down here?? This place is 24 bucks for a regular pedi as opposed to most places at 25. She did a nice job, but they concentrate too much on legs instead of feet.

- Thai Shrimp salad with (iceburg) lettuce, tomato, onion, and green and red bell pepper. This was very light not heavy enough for a main salad but would make a good side salad for two people.

It was a lot more oily than I expected, the pieces of meat was quite fatty as well. There wasn't a lot of meat on the roasted duck either. The tofu was soaked too, and even though the picture advertised with broccoli they only had lettuce.

"Very disappointed!!

This was my second visit to this salon... And I have to say I am very disappointed :-( I booked my first appointment after seeing their new salon open up in Ahwatukee next to my local Target. They were super friendly and nice to work with... When I went in for my appointment, I had a pre consult with what appeared to be the receptionist.  Super sweet girl! She sold me on a monthly membership that we get me my fills at a discount.

When I had my lashes done... The lady kept stopping every few minutes to cough and sanitize your hands... Which in itself isn't a big deal but it wasted a lot of time :-(she didn't really go over with me the types of different lash styles that she could do and I didn't realize at that time she was very limited on what she could do.

When she was done with my lashes they appeared to be okay... But way too spaced apart and weren't customize to my eye at all. Since my appointment took about 20 minutes longer than they had quoted me... I was in a rush and decided that they were okay and I would give this place another shot. So I booked my next appointment for three weeks out.

Three weeks later... I came to my appointment 10 minutes early. when I back to her room, I explained to her that I needed them to look a little bit more full and not so spaced apart and a little bit shorter with the cat eye look. The cat eye look with something I explained that I was looking for to start with.

So we get started... She's super nice and friendly there was no problem there. But she only allotted an hour to do my lashes. So since it's been 3 weeks, understandably, my eyelashes needed a little bit more attention. A my opinion when someone books an appointment 3 weeks out the salon should have noticed that and made a little bit more time for this appointment and mentioned that it could be a longer appointment. However that did not happen... And I was only there for an hour, which is the normal amount of time for normal fill, and she literally told me that my left eye is not going to be as full as my right eye and it's about 80% done because she is running short on time. I was completely shocked and baffled and explain to her that I didn't want my eyes to look different. She said she understood but she was up on her time.  She self admitted that she was going to rush through it to get as much done as she could. I'm sorry but I'm paying good money for these lashes and I don't want them to be as good as they can be within her alloted time. This is very frustrating.

So, I walked out of there with not the look that I had requested and only 80% of my left eye being done LOL so the inside of my left eye is not really done and I definitely don't have the cat eye look and they aren't much Fuller at all :-(

Needless to say I'll we cancel my membership and I will not be back :-( I'm extremely disappointed in the customer service and the fact that I was told I need to come in sooner so that way I could avoid the situation. It's not like I just booked the appointment a couple of days ago and I'm already 3 weeks out... I book the appointment 3 weeks out the same day I got my initial lashes on because I was going to be out of town.

"My girlfriend and I stopped over here for lunch. We literally had the place to ourselves and were able to order off the lunch menu. The spicy items are marked accordingly and on the other side of the menu were Thai inspired dishes.

From her vantage point she could see some people coming in for take out. The lunch prices are very reasonable. With your choice of entree you get a choice of soup or eggroll, white, fried, or brown rice as your side. With your check you get a store bought fortune cookie.

She had the General Tso's chicken with rice and eggroll. I had the chicken and shrimp entree mixed with vegetables. Needless to say service was fast and the food very tasty.

"An open letter to Warren Buffet, Berkshire Hathaway, and the 'Powers-that-Be' at NV Energy.

Dear Mr. Buffet,
I have to say, that though I am foursquare and full tilt for Capitalism (notice the Capital C), I am not very enamored in the way by which many of your companies are deriving their profits. NV Energy being one of the most eggregious examples. 

This organization not only monopolizes the Energy market in Clark County, they actively engage in market stategies that smack of cronyism, misinformation, and slander. 

I, for one, would like to be like you, having the power to be as self-determined and self sufficient as possible. Yet, when I try to do something as simple as control my own power bill, I am met with extreme resistence. Not only is there no choice available to me, but the choices that make the most sense in Nevada (think SOLAR) are beset with resistance by the 'Big Bully on the block' NV Energy. I.E. NV Energy actively engages in an information propoganda war against what is the best source of energy for a Clark County citizen. But, solar is not on the NV Energy agenda, so is not given to me as a choice.

"This is gonna be a long one, but it will be worth your time if u r planning to take it to this shop. I gave it 1 star cause 0 or minus stars is not optional.Stay away from this place as far away as you possibly can. See my photographs! 

I truly believe that every day they pick up Mexicans standing by the Home Depot to paint their cars.

My first contact was with one of the two guys running the shop, I believe it was the manager, and he gave me an estimate of $500 to paint my hood, front bumper, and blend in the side panels. It is common sense to do the panels when you paint hood\/bumper. They were not planning on removing the bumper to paint it. Again, common sense prevails, in order to get it done right is to remove the bumper so that the paint don't chip\/crack from the edges. I told him to remove the bumper, and I was willing to pay extra just to get it done right, and they charged me little more, but I was good with that as long as they do the job right. 

I left my car for about a week, and when I picked it up the bumper had smudges on it, and was cracking on the edges. They did not blend in the side panel, and you could tell the color did not match the hood, and bumper. 

They never removed the bumper completely, they removed it partially by ripping it off the screw\/clips, which caused additional damage to the plastic radiator core inside of the hood above the bumper, which is attached to the hood-prop-rod. They just left the plastic broken, and the attached hood-prop-rod completely detached from the radiator core. BELIEVE IT OR NOT THEY JUST SHOVED THE HOOD-PROP-ROD (not attached to anything) IN BETWEEN THE BUMPER, AND RADIATOR. To replace the part it cost me $450, not including labor. 

When they removed the bumper they broke the holes for the screws\/clips on the side of the bumper, which are now missing, and the bumper wasn't perfectly aligned with the side panels. They never attached the grill on top of the bumper, and just left with only the top part attached to the broken radiator core.

They didn't cover the carpet inside of the vehicle, and left paint on from stepping on it. I THOUGHT I WAS ON A HIDDEN CAMERA SHOW, and thought that this was a JOKE. I was just waiting for someone to come out and tell me that this was a joke. 

I complained about it to the manager guy that gave me an estimate, and to another guy that's possibly the owner. I told them about the issue, and especially pointed out the damage, and told him that the side panels have not been blended in. Even though the owner wasn't present during the original estimate he told me we didn't think I wanted the panels done. I can't emphasize enough how many times I told them what I needed done, DONE RIGHT, plus it's common sense every professional shop will tell you that the side panels always need to be blended in, or otherwise the paint job will not look right. 

He told me that its common for the radiator core and the hood-prop-rod to break because it's common on these cars, a 2014 vw Jetta. He blamed it on the manufacturer LOL. 

OK, I GET IT, EVEN IF! You F...... broke it, NOT ME. It broke while it was in your possession. I felt like I was talking to 2 IDIOTS. U should know this as someone that claims is running a professional paint shop. 

AGAIN, I didn't make a scene because they offered to fix it, but told me that I would have to pay additional $200 for the side panels cause they never included it in the estimate. LIE! I just wanted to get it done, and left the vehicle for another week. I just wanted to get it over with, and never return to this place again. 

The owner guy told me this time he will paint it, and get it don't right. I picked it up the next week, AND GUESS WHAT? Few days later a piece of paint from the hood came off. I wasted so much time, money fixing the broken parts, and other small stuff that it would have been cheaper for me to just take it to a REAL PROFESSIONAL BODY SHOP TO GET IT DONE RIGHT. Lesson learned. If it's a cheap paint job it's most likely going to be a shitty job. Please check out the pictures I attached to see the damage they caused.

"I found Bambu on Yelp when I was looking for a smoothie to tide me over until lunch. I wanted  simple strawberry and banana and mostly fruit. Unfortunately, what I got at Bambu was more like a milkshake with very little strawberries and bananas in it.  The flavor was OK, just very weak. It tasted more like vanilla ice cream than anything. Also, it was expensive for a small.  Finally, at the time, I was the only one in the store, and it still took quite some time to make my smoothie.  I felt like the quality of the yogurt or the ice cream or whatever they used was high-quality, if you're looking for something for your kid that is more like a milkshake, then this would be the place to go. However, I wanted a healthy smoothie that was mostly fruit, so I would probably not go back.",0.0

I explained that the previous owner was a smoker therefore I needed everything painted to help get rid of the smell. I was told that he would use a special base to help cover the smell. I asked about the vents, was told don't worry, they will be painted and look brand new. 
The kitchen and a bathroom was not going to be painted right away due to wall paper and redecorating. I didn't question the estimate because like I said, it was a time sensitive job.
I sent him an email with my color choices for the rooms.. no questions were asked by them.  
Ok, first.. was supposed to start on a Monday, that didn't happen because they were running late on the previous job. 
Second. I let them in at 8 am as I was working during that time. When I came at the end of the day. I was floored. They used an eggshell finish .. all I could see was this shine on all my walls... he tried to tell me it was a matte..really? Then said, you didn't want this finish? 
But guess what, my fault because I didn't have it written down, guys get it writing!!
I didn't realize that painting only includes walls. Not doors or frames, not closets.. which all were filthy...

My low rating wasn't t due to the lack of quality, but more about their ""deals"" and customer service. I am a caregiver for a patient who is a disabled combat veteran. He used to purchase his meds from here, right after they opened, but eventually went elsewhere after the low quality became too much for him to ignore. Recently, he had to renew his card and was told by the referring Dr. that Sunflower was under new ownership and had stopped charging outrageous prices for mediocre product. He decided to give them a try again. He was pleased on his first visit to be told that his veterans discount was now 15% and it was combinable with their deals. So for the last month, he has been in, purchasing the above mentioned $50 cans, and the cartridges, which I think are about the same price. He has always gotten his veterans discount, he has gotten his ""tax free Tuesday"" discount and has been able to use his $15 rewards a couple of times this month alone.......until today. He was advised that he couldn't be greedy and ""stack"" his discounts. I personally spoke with the manager, Rebecca, who said that has always been their policy. At the conclusion of the call, I stated to her that it sounds like they are more concerned with their bottom line than with their patients wellbeing.
And p.s. it's hard for me to take your company seriously as professionals, when your bud tenders are talking about how great the weed brownies are, that a patient made for them! I think that's showing a lack of integrity, but how much can you expect from employees who also are patients! SMH!",0.0

I arrived in Vegas and almost rented a car. Since I was going to stay at a hotel which had monorail stop, I decided against renting a car. I made arrangements through this company for transportation to and from the hotel to the airport. Getting to the hotel on  was fine. I was given a receipt for return trip and told to call and make arrangements 24 hours in advance for a pick from the hotel to the airport. 

For the return trip, I called to schedule a pick from the hotel to the airport as instructed. The person on the phone making my reservation was less than cordial but scheduled my pick up for 6:05 PM the next day. My departure from the airport was at 8:45 PM. 

On the pick up day, I went to the pick up spot outside my hotel and waited several minutes and waited until about 6:25 before calling the # on the receipt but no one answered. I made 5 separate calls and no one answered. On the 5th call, by using a different option in the menu, I finally reached someone  I explained to the person who answered my call and said I was waiting for a scheduled ride. He confirmed I had a 6:05 PM scheduled pick. He put me on hold for several minutes as he tried to figure out what was going on what to do. When he returned on the phone, he told me no one in ""dispatch"" was answering his call either and he had no idea on what to do other than try to get to the dispatch and have them call me. He had no other option or alternative for me other than some how getting a hold of ""dispatch"" to call me. He assured me he will have ""dispatch"" call me as soon as he was able to reach them. After hanging up the phone, I waited another 15 minutes but no one called. I tried calling the # again but no one answered. To this date, I have not heard from anyone from your company.

Our waiter was extremely kind & he is not the reason I'm rating this place so low. The reason for my 2 star rating is because the food really just was not anything special. I paid $11+ for some mediocre pancakes that I found to be extremely dry, hash browns, sausage and eggs. For breakfast food such as this, that is way overpriced. My friend paid $12+ for corn beef hash. That is just insanity when ""egg works"" right down the road is like half the price and higher quality food.

In some ways they were met and in others they fell short although perhaps as they work out the kinks things will improve.

The good - an interesting array of pettable and viewable creatures from clown fish to sea horses, sting rays to sharks.  you can feed and pet the sharks, rays and some of the bigger fish.

"Out of most of your standard chain restaurants, Seasons 52 is often considered to be one of the better choices based on what most people say. We've dined here twice, but only because I received one of those gift cards that covers the multiple restaurants that the Darden Corporation owns. And when you look the other options (Olive Garden, Yard House, etc), Seasons is probably your safest bet.

I appreciate the gimmick of the menu changing with the seasons - although this isn't something that's quite as unique as people claim. A portion of the menu, the chef's recommendations, apparently changes every week. The core menu, however, remains the same - which is good if you find something that you're a fan of.

During our most recent visit, we ordered a meyer lemon and ricotta ravioli. It was decent, with a nice lemon-zest and peas that were very nice quality, aided by the addition of brown butter. We also ordered a crispy green tomato and burrata board. The burrata was standard stuff, while the green tomatoes weren't really our thing. The honeycomb was very good, but the serving size was the equivalent of one of my one-a-day vitamin pills. During our first visit, we ordered one of their flatbreads and weren't really all too impressed, so we stayed clear of those during our return.

I ordered the filet mignon, which is the same thing I ordered during our first visit. This comes with some lumpy mashed potatoes and so-so roasted asparagus. It was okay, but not quite on the level of what can be obtained at this price point if you know where to look. On the other hand, my girlfriend ordered the cedar plank roasted salmon and was mostly pleased with its flavor.

We opted for the Belgian chocolate s'more and mocha machhiato. These desserts are very light and cleverly layered. They're actually very good and I see it as a neat little concept. In fact, most of what you eat here is very light, due to their intentional efforts to keep calories below a certain threshold that we all know makes our stomach churn.

For a chain, Seasons 52 is by no means a bad choice. And while I'd much prefer obtaining this type of food from a respectable local steakhouse, I can see the appeal for many. And while nothing particularly ""wowed"" us, I still think it's worth trying out for yourself.",0.0

The ONE piece of grouper was seasoned and fried very well but that's all I really enjoyed. The greens were a little bitter and the yams mushy but the price was ok. I can't say that I'll return here but it seems to be a popular place where many locals visit and take out.  I don't have much more to say because I didn't have much on my plate to review lol.

"As first timers, we had a wait of nearly 45 minutes to check in using the Express kiosk.  There was no staff on hand to expedite the process.

He said that I was either going to be examined the way he wanted or he would refuse to be my provider in the future. At one point in the exam, I was so stressed by his manner and method, that I was crying. His response to this was to rudely snap ""Ma'am, would you like me to give you a minute?""

"#PiedmontNaturalGas and all these hidden, unknown fees...smh. I hate it when companies are the only supplier so they feel like they can bill you whatever they want. If you're charging me, it should be on the front of my bill with the other fee that's posted. I should know my current rate that you're charging me. I should know that current rate fluctuates every month and it should be posted every month on my bill. I should know there's a TN monthly charge that's charged at one rate during April-Oct and a higher rate during Nov-Mar. I should know what a WNA fee is and that I'm being charged for it during the months of Nov-Mar. I shouldn't have to call in because my bill doesn't add up to me and find out that these fees are included in my bill that I don't see and there's no explanation of them on the bill.

"It's ok.  It's cleaner on the inside than some of the PT's I've been too. However a PT's is a PT's...

We got there around 8:30 p.m. and waited for someone to take our drink order until about 9:15. That is an absurd amount of time for a bar that is not that busy, has a wait staff, and a bartender. By wait staff I mean there was one waiter, taking drink orders to tables that were not right at the bar. So just to put it into perspective she did not even have to leave the bar to take our order or anyone else's, it's literally her only job to serve drinks and put in food, especially serve drinks to those just walking in. Plus there was no extenuating circumstances to cause such a delay. I made eyes at her look Restless pretty much did everything but Snap My Fingers, and she was just busy chit-chatting with people who already had full beers.

I've always been a fan of soft serve and whenever I find a place that serves a dairy-free vegan version of it, you know I'm down like Chinatown. 

There's so much hype here, the first time I came here, I actually ubered. You can tell how my uber driver's reaction was when he picked me up near Yonge and Dundas and asked ""...am I dropping you off to get ice cream?"" ..and it didn't help that it was negative 20 outside. YA GIRL LUVS HER COLD TREATS OKAY?

I've been here a few times and the only dairy free option in the winter was pumpkin spice, which wasn't the best. In fact, it was kind of weird. Meh. It was probably 2\/5. HOWEVER! Their spring\/summer menu is back and YASSS VEGAN ICE CREAM FROM COCONUT GOT ME GOIN' NUTS. I don't remember the exact name but it was something exotic and it's a coconut dairy free soft serve with toasted coconut flakes and drizzled with dark chocolate jizz. Or not jizz.

It's hella aesthetic aka it's a photo opportunity for all my Instagram thots, so it's really hyped and when places are really hyped, they turn $$$$.. pro tip: never get a ""smallz"" as a size. It's literally a sample cup size of ice cream. Literally the size of a Starbucks hot drink sample cup. For $5? Ya right, bye. The biggie size is A LOT bigger for $7, almost $8. Yo this cold treat is going to make my wallet cry! Why don't they have a medium?
Also, just a simple soft serve without toppings is $5 alone; getting that wouldn't even make sense. Seriously, a chocolate vanilla twist soft serve is $4.95 or something. What.

"Insomnia seems to be one of those places where the ambiance and the people are the main draw, with the food coming in a very distant second place. And that's fine. The ambiance is indeed quite lovely, and the service has always been above average (in my experience).

On this particular occasion, we were a group of four that had shown up on a busy Saturday night without a reservation. Fortunately for us, a reservation had just been cancelled, so we were quickly shown to a table near the door (which got a little chilly every time the door was opened, but we certainly weren't in a position to complain).

We decided to share a couple of appetizers: Epic Three Cheese Nachos and Roasted Garlic Chickpea Hummus. After placing our order, however, our waitress helpfully pointed out that the nachos would probably be enough for a party of our size (noting that the hummus also comes with nachos). This was a remarkably generous thing for her to do and you can bet our tip reflected it.

Unfortunately, the Epic Three Cheese Nachos (""Fresh Tortilla Chips, Cheese Blend, Kalamata Olives, Grilled Bell Peppers, Pico De Gallo, Salsa, Sour Cream, Guacamole"") were nothing too special. The platter sure looked impressive but a few bites in and I realized that they were more show than they were substance. There was just enough cheese to cover the top portion of the nachos, leaving the remainder dry and sad. The salsa tasted suspiciously (and prominently) like it came out of a jar, while the portion of sour cream and guac was wanting (to put it lightly).

"First tech came and was great. Told us & company what was needed. They needed to submit a report to insurance. That took upwards of two weeks!! 

Finally got the report, and made a second appointment., but no one showed. When I called the next morning to say no one showed, the girl (think it was Jenn) apologized and said someone would be there that same day between 1-6. I never received any confirmation so called again around 3...again she told me someone would come. Nothing by almost 5, so called yet again because I knew they'd be closing at 5 (which I experienced the day before when tried to call about the no-show). Talked to a guy (very nice) who apologized and told me he did not know why we were told that someone would be coming because we were not on the schedule. He rescheduled me AGAIN. 

Side note: when I called after 5 the night of second appointment the office was closed & the message said to press one for after hours emergency...that only gave me a message that said that was invalid entry.

If I can rate this a no star I would!!!! Worse customer service ever ..first we were waiting for ever for them to take our order . As we ordered our food I ordered Parmesan herb chicken and it comes with mashed potatoes and green beans I asked for corn succotash instead. We waited about 30 + for our food. Finally food came out my side of corn wasn't ready and server said just a few more minutes ... 10 minutes passed maybe even more nd nothing... finally the manager comes out and says they are all out of the corn succotash and what did I want instead .  At this time I was upset and told him to bring out fries. I didn't even eat the fries I was so upset that a busy resturant runs out of their own food. I waited about 10-15 min for our server to come out and to say they were all out. Then Our server never came back to check on us if we needed refills on our drinks . We finally got our check and I asked the server if I had to pay for the full plate since I didn't get a full plate bcz they were missing the corn and I never touched the fries. He said he would go talk to the manager about that . He offered me a free desert bcz he took for ever in helping us and he didn't check on us. He left and came back left the bill and took off really fast as we checked the bill we noticed that they charged me for the desert and then took it off. I waited for like 5 min and called him over as he was trying to avoid us. I told him to get his manager. He came out and I asked him if he was going to do something about my plate not being complete and his response was oh I already did ure taking the desert and I told him I didn't want the desert . And that the server said. He was giving us the desert bcz he didn't take care of us. And he said okay I didn't charge the corn and I told him he did bcz the plate was 17.50 and that's what I was getting charged. Then he said the corn was extra charge and I said I've never been charged extra for the corn and he said I can get the servers in trouble bcz they not charging right and I told him Ive always ordered this and have never been charged and he said o well ure lucky I dnt charge u. I told him I dnt want the cake the only reason I got it it's because the server said that was free bcz of his timing issue. He finally said he would take 5 buck off the bill. This manager was so not professional fighting w me instead of making a customer happy . I will never visit this place again. This managers name was Liam I think.,0.0

I visited salon because I was looking for a better price for the blow out but ended up paying the same price . The difference this time was the at this salon , the stylists seemed very inexperienced. I felt like I paid $250 to be practiced on . There was no master stylist looking over the work my stylist was doing , although my stylist was very nice so that's why I'm giving the 2 stars . I will not be visiting this salon again but hope the owner will hire someone like a manager to look over the technique her stylists are using . I truly feel like my hair is worse",0.0
The only reason i gave them 2 stars is because the dentist was actually very nice and the lady who called me when i stormed out was very nice. But other than that i feel this was a bait and hook situation. I called and made an appointment them knowing i had insurnace and being told they would verify my insurance never once being told this was foming out of my pocket than i myself have to charge my insurance company. They basically wasted my time to come in were trying so hard to push me to do it on credit which i dont want want to do and thank god i put a block on my social were nothing goes through at first until i am contacted through the mail. Not at ANY TIME in the phone conversation did they tell me i was going to pay the full price than i have to go bill my own insurance.  Very shady and misleading practice. Thank god found a great dentist down the street who was honest and helped me out today because i had such a bad root canal that was infected but no thanks to this shady company,0.0

"The Whitfield is the restaurant in the Ace Hotel. The hotel and restaurant are both very hipster and cool, but overall feels comfortable. The lounge\/bar area is a nice place to hang out. They typically have a good beer selection and also serve delicious Stumptown coffee.

My biggest gripe with the Whitfield? The lack of vegetarian\/pescatarian options. They have two breakfast options, but last time I went, they had zero dinner options. They did have a few sides and apps, but I wasn't that impressed with the onion dip or the other non-memorable side dish. I feel like they might eventually have more vegetation friendly options, but for now it's a place I avoid for dinner.

"Beautiful interesting hotel, but I will not return to this hotel again. This hotel is a 3 star hotel & I had no clue it was. 3 star hotels are not the best at all, but anyways when I walked into my room, the bathroom was not cleaned well at all. The shower was surrounded by long pieces of hmhair & the hair was also clogged in the drain in the shower. The shower was making this aggravating noise because of the leak. They fixed it on the day before I left. The tub was not cleaned either. The bottom of the tub had bacteria spots. I thought the toilet was clean, but it had dirty spots when you lift up the toilet seat. The sink was not cleaned well either, dirt was left inside the sink.

The TV was very strange and weird. The tv goes out after a while because I guess if the signal or something that o don't know. Both of the beds had pieces of hair under the pillow & on the sheets. The first day walking into the hotel room, the room was very icky & grungy. It was hot in the room until the day before last it was fixed. The buffet was just OKAY. It wasn't extraordinary, fantastic or wonderful like the other hotel buffets. The breakfast in my opinion was the BEST THING at the buffet. I loved everything about the breakfast buffet. The breakfast food had a better taste than the lunch buffet. 

The lady did not say clearly that the breakfast buffet was $24.78. When she said it sounded like she said $21.48, but wasn't. Anyways I paid $24.78 for the Saturday weekend brunch.

The other desserts was soooo nasty. I would not recommend eating the other desserts at all, but if you want to then go ahead.

Let's start off with the customer service. All the employees were really friendly and nice. Always came to the table to make sure everything was ok & always offered to refill our drinks, etc... and that our food was on its way.

The food was average. I got the soy sauce chow mein (chef special) which was $9.25 it was ok. Nothing special but I was really craving for noodles so that satisfied my craving. I also got orange chicken something on their regular menu. It was fresh & yummy!! I really enjoyed it I give it a 8\/10. From the dim sum menu I got sui mai, baked pork buns & shrimp and chive dumplings. These were all made to order so they were hot and fresh!! Taste wise would be 7\/10. Tasted like average dim sum. 
Their dim sum menu is very limited. They didn't have much but they had the popular items I would say. 

Pricing - the dim sum was pricer than other dim sum places I've tried (for example orchid garden). The dim sum items were $3.50 each....

"I stop into this Starbucks fairly regularly for an americano in the morning. The two best things about this Starbucks are its location and the seating. The location, in the corner of Market Square right next to Winghart's, is really hard to beat. Its the closest Starbucks for many office buildings, stores, and businesses. No wonder this place sees so much traffic! There is a fair amount of seating both inside and outside, but it tends to fill up quickly in the morning and around lunch. 

Now the not so great. I almost always order ahead when coming here because the line is always so long. Even despite ordering ahead, I still almost always end up waiting a bit for my drink. This is a common theme as I've seen other people have to ask for drinks that were missed by the baristas. I get that missing a drink here in there is possible, but at this rate I think we can safely call it a trend!

If you are looking for a quick espresso drink or place to meet someone in Market Square, this Starbucks fits the bill. On the other hand if you are searching for a great cup of coffee or espresso, you can find it elsewhere. I would try Bluebird Kitchen for espresso or 21st Coffee for pour over coffee (both within one block of this location).",0.0

He said ""oh those are in high demand -- we only have two and we keep those across the street."" Huh?? We mentioned we were already working with Woody, so he took us inside and got Woody. Remember Woody is the one who assured me the truck I wanted was there.  So we were told to wait while Woody said he'd ""bring the truck around."" After 15 minutes he came back and said that the truck was over in the side lot. We waited some more. After another 15 minutes he came back and said, ""we have to take it to get gas in it because it is running on fumes."" Seriously??? We wait some more.

"This may be the worst Subaru dealership in all of Pittsburgh.

We visited the dealership after much research to check out some vehicles because of the Presidents Day specials that were going on. From the start, the representative was a little awkward and seemed distracted, but we continued the conversation and test drove a vehicle.

After an hour or so of general awkwardness during the test drive, we felt that the gentleman was trying to force us into a sale without answers questions. In fact, my SO brought up several points that the representative didn't know the answer to.

After the test drive, we went back into the offices and wanted to get some breakdowns of cost on the options and packages of vehicles on premise. The representative became testy, making extremely rude comments to us about having not done our research (?), when it was the exact opposite. What I believe the issue was really that the representative was unprepared for the conversation and didn't have the necessary tools or patience to have an intelligent conversation about comparing options. He was focused on only getting us into the most expensive option with as few questions as possible. He also didn't listen to us when we said we did or didn't want a particular feature or option and kept pushing us toward something we weren't interested in.

"Came to hear Beatles music and see cirque de soleil acrobatics.  INSTEAD? they took the show to almost a darker version of itself.  I had heard it was a ""review"", but the first song was the only more innocent one prior to the Beatles gettig mixed up in their Eastern religioun- drug phase.  I felt preached at.  The dances didn't connect with the music. At All.  The man to my right stared straight ahead like he was counting the minutes till he could leave.  My husband fell asleep as did the kid whose parents had forked over a pretty penny to bring their tot along.

"My experience with the sales department was excellent, no pressure buy. I ended up purchasing a 2012 Ford Escape. However my time with Amir Fallahi in the financing department ruined the overall experience. 
I am a recent college grad purchasing my first used car. I brought my boyfriend with me for support. Amir treated us with nothing but sexism and ageism... fist bumping my boyfriend when he learned I am a graduate student stating ""damn dude"". Then when I proceeded to tell him I did not want gap insurance he pushed and pressured harshly implying I didn't know what I wanted. My boyfriend got stern because he was disrespectful and Amir lashed back.

"Hubby and I came to have a drink and bite to eat.  I love the look and atmosphere of the lounge.  They nailed the mermaid vibe.  It is like you are under the sea.  My biggest disappointment was they don't have a cocktail menu.  They have a full bar, why not make up a few cool mermaid or ocean theme cocktails?  Our bartender was nice but the best he could come up with was a Blue Hawaiian when I asked about the cocktail menu.  Hubby stuck with a cider.  For eats we ordered Chips, Salsa & Guacamole, Shrimp Alfredo Flatbread Pizza, and Fried Popcorn Shrimp.  The pizza and shrimp were good.  Skip the chips and salsa.",0.0
"I am very disappointed in the service here and especially with the customer service. We went on Saturday January 15 and we had a party of 5. From the time we walked in, we felt an unwelcoming feeling.  Plenty of the waiters and persons working in that late morning\/ afternoon shift were very unpleasant. Our waiter was Tammy and she was by far the worst waiter I ever came across in my life. She wasn't welcoming. Her attitude came off as she didn't even want to be there at work. We were very polite and she still was cold and mean. She was very aggressive with her responses. We ordered a omelette and it came half cooked. When I mentioned it to Tammy she rudely said "" What do you want me to do with it?""  and rolled her eyes.I was startled with that response. I felt very insulted and I had to tell her three times to take it back. I told her to please take it back and bring me a menu. Grabbed the plate and ran off with it. She never brought back the menu. Since she never brought the menu I requested to just make eggs and some bacon. She comes back with it and slams it on the table and walks off. She never came back and asked if the food was okay and if there was something else we needed. We were low on water, juices and she never came back. Then she comes with the checks and slams it on the table in between the  menus and said ""Here you go, Bye."" There were five separate checks and we couldn't even read who's bill was what. She didn't even have the courtesy to hand out our separate checks. We had to ask another waiter what was the process of paying because she never came back. We then saw her and told her if we can have boxes. My friend was trying to ask  her something as well and she just walked away. We had to ask another waiter to bring what we needed.  Tammy was very disappointing and I will never recommend anyone to this location and to deal with the horrible customer service that we went through. At this point we felt enough was enough and told Tammy to bring her manger to speak with us. The manager then comes and she was very nice and was able to help with the situation.",0.0
"This was a complete disappointment! We have been here before on the patio and had a wonderful experience.... but not this time. It was a crowded Saturday night and there were no reservations for the dinning room. We decided to sit in the bar. What a mistake!!! There were two bartenders, moving at a snails pace. We waited 10 minutes before they acknowledged us and then took one order at a time. We had others join us about 39 mins later who weren't served without my husband having to go find her. Seats at the bar became available and we were told they were reserved....RESERVED AT THE BAR.  By the end of the night we were a party of 8, and were were served once! We notice smaller parties being served on a more regular basis, and concluded they were regulars. When we finally were served, both bartenders were rude with attitudes. It was the worst experience which is too bad, we live close, like the atmosphere and the foods good. Complete disappointment!!!",0.0
"Having not visited this location for a year or two, the first thing that caught my eye was that they've went through some serious renovation since. There's a lot more black decor which gives it a more luxurious feel, especially when you're at check out. 

I came here after work to kill time and I stayed way longer than I expected.  The HomeSense section drew me in big time! It is small but it had a lot to offer for what I needed. What I appreciated the most was that only some items are picked through so you still had options. Their decor and organizational products are so super chic which matches my style perfectly​. I was also tempted by some of their furniture offerings! I ended up walking away with a couple of small clearance items but I'll keep checking back as I want to redecorate my space.

However, the management side of absolutely disgraceful !!!

In the end, I was forced to pay full price. I have never been treated this terribly by a massage spa in my life! 

Now I have paid twice for 1 massage. Management took absolutely no responsibility for any kind of mistake. This establishment is nothing more than a scam and treats you even worse.

"Great service and side dishes but the steak was inedible.  Had the roasted thick cut bacon, portobello fries, and the roasted broccolini as sides.  The portobello fries were amazing and I would say are a must-try.  The restaurant did not have the ribeye cap available that night so I opted for the full ribeye medium rare.  First 2 bites were filled with a piece of gristle which was very disappointing and essentially inedible.  I tried to then work around the steak to a different area to avoid the offensive section - of which the next 3 out of 4 bites were also gristle filled.  At that point, I gave up and shared my concerns with the waiter who was polished, gracious, and professional.  The manager stopped by coincidentally to discuss the wine we were drinking and I shared the dining experience with him which he also received very professionally.  I'd like to return for the professional courteous service and exemplary side dishes.",0.0
"I'm sure after a few bad reviews, they improved a little bit. There was no bouncer at the door and we walked right in to the bar. Someone had later came to check our ID's, which was fine; we came early, as it wasn't that busy. We had put one of our ID's on hold to play one of the games and they even gave us a free drink and didnt charge us in the alcoholic ice cream we ordered, and we had ordered a decent amount of drinks, and it was fairly cheap. A week later, my boyfriend didnt realize he had left his ID there and they actually still had it there, unlike other places where it could've gotten misplaced after the night by whoever was holding it. It was decent service. The theme wasn't so much ""geeky"" or ""nerdy"". It didnt seem so welcome to those who've been deemed that stereotype. It is just a typical bar with decent service.",0.0

"When into buy a new printer along with a surface pro keyboard and left 40 minutes later with none of the above.  First off the printer we wanted was not in stock which in itself is not a big deal,  We were told that we could purchase it at their location and pick it up at the Chandler store . Great we thought until they couldn't get their computers to allow this to happen.  When I asked why they couldn't just call the other store and have them hold it for us and we could all be happy I was told that they do not do that . This was after 30 minutes of them trying to get thier systems to work.  
Second when we found the keyboard and it appeared to have minor damage to it and was told that it was the only one in stock but they would give us a discount on it we again thought great,  that was until we went to pay for it and the same person who offered the discount informed me that it would take at least a hour before the discount would show up in their computer systems and we would need to wait to purchase it at that price.

Went to this place with a friend a walk. We were looking for a place to eat Yonge and Dundas and decided to give this place a try. This place is huge with high ceilings. There is a second floor but not sure it's for customers. Apart from that and the sweets the sell the food is just regular. No better than a typical sharwama joint. The service is crappy.

"Used records here have taken a serious nose dive. Maybe it was inevitable, as all Zia spots are dumpsters for used records. This location used to price fair, but now they check everything against discogs and price on the higher end. Hey, why would you want customers to get a good deal and return? Nope. They will max out prices, and the records will sit for weeks. Most of the stock here should be in a $1 bin. 
But now they're sneaky! Purchased a used record and got home and noticed they conveniently placed their price tag over a tear on the cover, which of course wasn't revealed until I removed it at home. And no, my peeling didn't cause the tear.

Every time I've gone to this location I've had issues with the different employees each time.

On other occasions male employees (whose name I didn't get) have been rude as well. I'm only looking to improve customer satisfaction because I do enjoy the food.,0.0
The waiter hovered until I ordered. The Capese salad whose d description includes prosciutto actually contains tiny scraps of fried prosciutto. And the gnocchi was drowned in an inch of oil. This is not the restaurant I remember it to be. Very disappointing. Probably why they are more than half empty.

"While in Scottsdale, we were looking for a brew pub and we found SBC via YELP.  We generally look for a good beer selection first, the food is secondary, as most brew pubs offer a decent burger, wings, appetizer menu.  The website boasted 18 draft beers, with some nice choices.  We ordered a 6 beer flight of IPA's, they were 5 oz tasters for $10, a very affordable price for the beer.  I generally will order flights when trying a new brewery with nothing that jumps out at me.  Four of the six beer were good, two were pretty much undrinkable.  Keep in mind all craft beer drinkers have different palates, so to each his own.  Now for the food, we ordered some appetizers, variations of veggies, fried brussel sprouts (awesome), charred broccoli (very good) and street tacos (good).  Our entries were Southwest Chicken Salad (good), Salmon BLT (good), The Godfather (good).  If visiting Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed, fairly good beer selection and food is good.  Three starts because in a city the size of Scottsdale, there are probably some really good options out there, we'll keep looking.",0.0
"I used to be a fan of Asian Legend. I've been to many locations. The first one at Yonge and Sheppard area, Ravel Road, Highway 7, Steeles. When the don mills location opened I was so excited it was large and newly renovated and modern looking. In my mind this location has always suffered in service and good. It is not the same quality in food or service to the other locations. If the other locations are 5 stars then this location is a 3 star at best. The last 4-5 times I have been here at this location the service has been terrible. The staff don't speak Cantonese or mandarin or English properly. If you ask them a question you will get a wrong answer. None of the wait staff know the answer to any question on the menu. If you ask the price of the lobster you will be told one price but someone else will tell you differently. I was told $25.99 for one lobster and another waiter within 5 minutes told me it was $35 per lobster. Any question to the server is usually responded with a loud yell or ""what?""  For the price that you pay to eat here it is not a pleasant experience. We always come and sit in one of the private room and they charge 15% tip on top of the price and the service is terrible. They don't change your plates, there are no napkins there are never any servers around. Service doesn't justify the mandatory service charge. The food is standard. My lobster tower today arrived looking nice but the meat tasted mushy inside like dead lobster and not fresh. They put a lot of seasoning over and above the usual tower flavorings to hide this today. It is a bad replica of fisherman clubhouse. For those who have had ASIAN legend before at other locations you won't be happy here. The standard dishes steamed buns, noodles and simple dishes are acceptable but the other dishes are a sad state. My VIP membership for ASIAN legend expired and I won't be renewing. This place has left a bad impression and I will be avoiding the whole chain altogether.",0.0
"My friend and I made reservations online for $30 each which would get us a limo pick up, admission, and two drinks. We were told to be downstairs at a certain area at 9:15. Our limo driver John was 10-15 minutes late and then he couldn't find us. I kept telling him where we were and he told us to go an opposite way. All he had to tell us was that he was across the street from us. Instead we walked down the street the wrong way and he flipped a u-turn to get us. When we got to the club with the other girls in the limo they told us he was already in a bad mood before he got us. When we go to pay the cashier told my friend and I $40 each. I argued saying we reserved for $30 but she said our ticket says $40. She told us we'd get a ride back so we obliged. The moment we sit down at a table 5 different guys were on us asking if we wanted a dance. My friend pointed at me and I guess he whispered to her it was $25. We said nevermind. We had JUST sat down and wanted to warm up and get the feel of the place, these guys were pushy. All of us at the table agreed we were thinking there'd be a stage show and then mingling time. Instead there was a few short stage shows and the guys were doing lap dances at the same time as the show. You'd think they'd give eachother enough respect to not do lap dances during the show since the guy on stage could make more money if everyone was paying attention to him. We spent a few hours here and we were told to call our limo driver for the return ride. I called and texted him. Waited 45 minutes without a response. When I asked one of the girls at the main entrance downstairs for help she said there was nothing they could do since it was another company (in a mean tone and practically rolling her eyes. This makes me think it happens more times then not.) We ubered out of there instead. This experience was supposed to be fun and exciting but instead it felt like a rip off and the customer service was AWFUL and NONEXISTENT. Only help I had was from Thomas who offered us another night with some shots but honestly we never want to go back. I asked for the difference we were forced to pay without getting a ride back and I got that within a few days.",0.0
"Went there opening day, it smelled good from the outside while we were waiting. Getting in was disappointing because the only options were tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, chicken, gyro, and rice with a small assortment of sauces. I have allergies so I couldn't have their white sauce and got hummus instead, which they didnt tell me was extra! The food was overall bland and just a small amount of the hot sauce made the dish almost inedible.

Our greeting was mediocre and we were not explained the ""rules of the lounge."" We got some fun cocktails from the bar, but the entire bar was rained out. They have cotton seat cushions that were wet and they have no bar stools.

This hotel is located on a back street from the Las Vegas strip behind the now very infamous Mandalay Bay Hotel. Parking is plentiful as long as you don't mind not having a parking right in front of your actual room on busy weekends. Be sure to check-out by the check out time stated or you can incur a $30 fee. TV had working cable. If you are one of those types that doesn't need the big glitz and glamour of a major Las Vegas Hotel, or the big price tag that comes with staying there, then this is a suitable place.

We finished our meal and 10 minutes later we paid our bill at the kiosk because the waitress wasn't around. We finally got a hold of the waitress because our receipt didn't print and also asked for our dessert to go because she never brought it. She said they don't bring it unless you ask for it.  We told her this isn't the first chilis we have been to and the waitress is always attentive to the patrons and do not need to be reminded about when to bring the food out.

"More like a 3.5 review. Wanted to try a new sushi restaurant since the one we usually go to is closed Mondays. Soooooo....looked at a couple of places on Yelp and Daisho Sushi was what we decided on on a Monday night.

We came here around 7pm and it wasn't busy at all. There was a total of 6 people at the restaurant...including my bf and I. We never do AYCE sushi....we like ordering a la carte. So spicy tuna roll is what we wanted to start off with. It was pretty good....you can't really fk up that roll. Next we ordered a Godzilla and Spicy Girl. 
Godzilla was supposed to have soft shell crab but we barely got any in there. There were actually more crab meat and avocados than anything else! Spicy Girl was good....a lot of flavors going on with that one. Presentation was nice and they don't skim you on rolls....it was packed with yummy goodness. Specialty rolls ranged from like $10.95-14.95.

"This is an adequate hotel. If you are an SPG elite member then the redeeming quality is Marie.   She is the hostess and she welcomes you and makes sure you have what you need.  Almost every other Sheraton I've been to the host has told me that they were closed if I walked in after the food had been put away. They don't close. They just stop serving food. There's a difference. Lack of training if their problem. Here at this Sheraton that isn't a problem. What spurred this was the towel I grabbed to dry my face off after my shower. First it smelled like BBQ. I like BBQ. I just don't want to dry my face off with it. Stains and all. I grabbed a clean towel next. I took the lovely towel to the front desk and explained my displeasure. I got an apology. They could send up another clean towel but that was it. I don't need another towel. I need you to show me you see how gross this is. I left it on the front desk for them to take care of. At least someone has to pick the thing up and maybe explain why it's there. A gesture, any gesture would be appreciated. You lose. I wish I had thought to take a picture. 
   At check out in the morning, when asked if everything was alright I mentioned the towel thing to Chelsea. She said all the right things. She was going to address it with the head of housekeeping.

"My wife and I frequent the Downtown Summerlin mall all the time with out dogs but this time we went out on a date night. We wanted to try something different and settled on Crave. The restaurant was a little busy but there was no wait for at table outside, which was nice because the weather was beautiful. We looked at the menu, which seemed to be a bit all over the place but we eventually settled on a few different items. My wife had a ginger martini, which was really good and I had a boring iced tea, which I actually thought was pretty good for just plain iced tea.

My wife ordered a Calimari appetizer and a seared tuna salad of some sort. I started off with a spicy tuna roll and then a Traditional Poke Bowl. 

While our server was very friendly, she was also absent a lot and things took a very long time to come out. We were thirsty so we downed our drinks fast and had to ask for refills constantly. One time someone brought me an iced tea with no ice in it. The server caught it and got me a replacement. Again, she was VERY nice, but considering how many staff members were running around, I was a bit surprised how un-attentive everyone was. After a while, our calamari and tuna roll came out.  The Calamari was breaded nicely and was tasty. The roll though, was so small I almost needed a microscope just to find it on the plate. While it did taste good and the tuna had some good heat to it, I was a bit shocked at how minuscule the portion was. It was as if someone cut a tootsie roll into six pieces. 

After another 15 minutes, our other dishes came out...the salad and the poke bowl. It seemed as though my wife's order was pretty good all around but mine, not so much. Her salad looked OK and she seemed generally ""meh"" about it but my poke bowl, coming in at a 15 dollar price tag, was laughable. There was maybe 2 tablespoons of sushi plopped on top of some salad greens. The tuna was cut so small I almost had to eat this with a spoon. I've never seen a poke bowl served this poorly. I eat at poke bowl places all the time where, for 1\/2 the price, you get 3X the portion. 

We ate, and then waited around another 10 minutes after for our check, which we had to ask for. While dessert would have probably been an option, we didn't want to wait until the end of the season for it to arrive so we figured we'd have that elsewhere in the mall. All in all, an $85 dinner and when we left, we were still hungry. I'm embarrassed to admit this but for the price, we could have gone to Olive Garden and had a much nicer dinner for less money, and that is pretty sad. Our consensus is that we would never return to this restaurant.",0.0

"We were a party of three that arrived at 9:30pm on a day they close at 11:00pm. It was a slow evening and we only saw our waitress three times.  Once to order, once to refill our fries and to give us our check.  The runner that served our food literally threw our food on the table and almost spilled the hot plate on my lap.

"I come here often but only because I always in the area and it's out of my way to go anywhere else. The boba slushes are good but I've had much better. I just really wish they would start making their drinks with real fruits instead of syrups or whatever it is they use that is artificial. 
And when I ask for extra boba don't charge me and then not give me extra..

Also some of the employees need better training on the register because I order the same thing every time I come in and I'm always charged a different price each time. Today I noticed they charged me for a smoothie instead of a slush but I wasn't going to say anything because I was in a hurry and he didn't seem to know what he was doing. Also these people need some type of uniform or dress code because to me they don't even look like employees.

I also suggest maybe getting some cool new furniture or maybe some bean bags chairs and paintings & other decor to spice the place up. The random games in there are really awkward.

Edit:
I had to remove a star because I've always been told when I ask the employees if the boba slush's are vegan and I've always been told yes. Today I was told no. Why is their dairy in a boba slush?

"I'm fairly regular here since this place opened.  Prior to the remodel (which I was hoping would result in a change-up of their menu as well), I was happy with their sandwiches but not happy with the processed meat in their salads.  Since they reopened, not only have they not changed up their menu but they have changed their deli meat provider and the meat is now HORRIBLE.  I cannot even eat it.  I'm told that they stopped using Deitz (which to me isn't even comparable to high quality of Primo Taglio or Boars Head anyway) and are now using Hormel meats.  At nearly $8 a sandwich (and over $10 after tax for a combo), I would expect better quality meat than Hormel.  My opinion matches the general consensus of the people in my office.  The owner needs to re-evaluated if its worth it to downgrade quality on their products, when they are losing a large portion of their base in the process.

"LAST PARAGRAPH IS THE WORST. 

I came here twice and I ordered the same thing. I ordered the hot pot for two ~$24.99. Both times I ordered the same hot pot (there's a selection of 4 different hot pots with different soup bases and toppings). The first time we ordered it, it came with enoki mushrooms. The second time we ordered it, the enoki mushrooms were missing. It's inconsistent, but we didn't press on it because it wasn't a big deal. 

Originally, my friend and I wanted to order the bbq meat. It was extremely expensive ~$35-60 for one meat serving and you had to choose two meat servings! I went with one friend, so if we ordered it the bill would have probably came up to $90 for two people! I really don't like their ""you have to choose two meats"" policy and I'm assuming their meat is expensive because they've advertised it as aged meat. I'm not sure how much different that would taste, but i've always had kbbq at yonge and finch (korea town) and it was around $35 and enough to fill two people with empty stomachs! The ""must order two meats"" doesn't make sense to me, because ordering a kbbq should get a lot of meat as it is.

The worst part about this experience, or my second experience, was the customer service. The bill came and I was paying the bill in cash. My friend leaves because she's covered most of the bill (she payed the bills) and i'm handling the change. As soon as she leaves a staff (ahjumma) rushes in, corners me so I can't exit, takes the bills and says, ""YOU NEED TO TIP 10%. 10% TIP IS THE MINIMUM"". I was so confused because she was speaking so fast and she just came out of no where. She's also standing extremely close to me and it was just a weird and uncomfortable experience. Until I could underdtand what she was saying I kind of just froze there. I'm quite shy in person and i'm not that assertive... People were staring at me because she was being so loud about it, yelling at me and giving me a dirty look. Lol, when I realized what she said I couldn't even explain myself. I was looking for change so I wasn't done paying the bill... I was going to tip 10%... I was scared and nervous so I found the largest change in my wallet and just gave it to her.. she gave me a dirty look when I left, or basically the entire time. I will NEVER be going back there again. Also, what happens if someone wanted to tip less than 10% because service was that bad? I had no intentions of not tipping, but if others wanted to tip less as a reflection of their service, will you stop them then? This doesn't make sense. If you had asked nicely, I wouldn't have given a one star review, but I felt extremely upset because I was accused. Why did I have to get a dirty look from you and who are you for coming so close to me that you block my exit, tell me I can't leave, and just yell at me.",0.0

August 2, 2017-I go in to check out a Nissan Pathfinder. Everything looks great it runs great. Cool. Put an offer in. They ask how much would I like to down. I said $500. They said great we can ""work with you"" on that. Punching numbers in yada yada yada. And they come back with ""can you actually put $1500 down?"" I was skeptical but did like the vehicle. I said sure I guess I can do that, if it means I'll get the truck. They run some more numbers, credit check, whatever. They come back with a ""can you actually put $2350 down?"" I said no I can not do that. But they said they wanted to ""work"" with me so they said I can pay that $2350 within 45 days all while I get to keep the car. Cool. So that's settle. Got insurance. Drove home.

Flash forward to a couple weeks later:
August 31st-they say ""can you bring the car in we just need to take a couple photos."" Thinking nothing of it, head over there and they say ""finance fell through we're actually gonna be keeping the car."" I was like okay? So do I get my down payment back since finance fell through? They said ""no because you lied on your credit application."" WHAT?!?! I've never heard such thing. I spoke to Lulu on numerous occasions and her answer is still firm. Absolutely no refunds whatsoever. I wasn't even offered to look at another car or use that down for a cheaper a car or anything. It was straight up you're not getting your money back. I contacted the proper authority in order to attempt to get my money back and they advise that I mediate with the dealership before going through a full fledged civil lawsuit. Tried mediating and the answer on their end was still firm, YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK. So at this point, I have no choice but to go forward with a lawsuit because they don't want to negotiate with me. And they said I was lucky they didn't charge me for putting miles on the car and what not. So. Here we are.

"We had dinner here on Saturday, Jan 14. What used to be exciting, interesting food has become dated. The restaurant had so many empty tables, it was surprising.  Service was slow and somewhat inattentive.  When the entrees arrived rice was not fresh and was cold on the plate, as were the black beans.  I complained about this and the manager did correct the problem. However, the rice and beans originally served should have never been on the plate... If shows someone in the kitchen doesn't give a damn what is going out, and this may be an indication as to why there are so many empty tables on a Saturday night at 7 pm.

"Desperate for a quick and tasty meal after a long day and turned to Yelp for help finding an option in Markham while in town for a quick overnight.  While there were numerous options, I recognized the Jack Astor name and remembered the friendly bar tendered from a past trip to Vancouver.  So despite multiple options represented in Yelp, all with sold reviews, I went with the known entity. 

The facility itself was especially inviting, especially with the beautiful weather and outside seating area.  I did pass on outside seating as offered by the hostess as I wanted to sit at the bar.  It's a table for one thing for me. 

The bartender was on his game and after sitting down for no more than 2 minutes, the bar keep was in front of me to take my drink order.  The bartender asked if I wanted the small pint or the large pint. Really?   Isn't a pint a pint?   I requested small pint and surprisingly, the beer was served in glass larger than the rest of the pints patrons were drinking.  

When I had questions about menu selection, the bar keep was happy to provide advice.  I selected the seared Tuna bowl which features rice, a few veggies and I was told Quinoa.  I was also told the bowl was a big serving.  I was starving.  While it flavor was very good, I was disappointed with the portion size as a dinner portion and the rice didn't seem fresh.  

I would have rated the experience four if the portion sizes were adequately described. Plus, never during the course of the meal did the bartender ask how things were.  He did when he presented the bill at the end.

"I was there for the first time last week. I just happened to walk by! While I was growing up there use to be the ""cent"" store... we only needed a couple cents to get a bunch of candy! I always got the candy sticks in the fake cigarette packs, they were like a quarter... anyways, I was looking for those when I walked in. They have everything everywhere. It's a little chaotic, and the lady working said they change the layout quite frequently. They have some cool items, that you would not be able to find elsewhere. 
I asked her if they sold the candy sticks, and she said they did. She walked around the place and could not find it - she mentioned they must be sold out and to come back in a couple of weeks. 
Instead I saw something I wanted to buy my friend that I was suppose to be seeing soon (which ended up not happening anyways). I purchased the item it was a little over $9 in total. I get back home and... I don't have the item - she never gave me it! I am hardly uptown (especially at the EpiCenter) so I call them and ask if they can just refund me since I probably won't make it back there for a while. 
She said she had to tell her manager because she does not have the authorization to do so, which makes sense. She gets my name and number. 

Several days go by... no word. So I call back (and someone else answers) and I explain the situation. They said the same thing and got my information down - again. 

A couple more days go by... no word. I happened to be babysitting uptown and was able to swing by there. I explained the situation to the girl working and she asked for a couple minutes to figure it out. So, while I was waiting I decided to look around again and see if they had the candy sticks back in stock. After a little she comes back and says that we have my item in stock and she can just give me it - I told her no, since it was for someone else that I will no longer be seeing soon. She again leaves and returns and told me they cannot give me a refund... 
But can give me store credit. I did not want to get anything that day - so I asked if they had a gift card or a certificate so I can come another day. She hand wrote a certificate for me and told me if there are any problems when I come back in to redeem it to tell them to call her. 
I am just a little fed up with the way this situation was handled. If they would have just told me in the beginning I cannot get a refund and only store credit this wouldn't have gone a week. 
I am going to go back (not in a rush though) so my money does not go to waste.

"After much drooling over insta pics, I finally got over to Butter Baker today for a lemon meringue croissant. I WAS EXCITED ABOUT THIS. Ok, I was less excited when I learned that they were affiliated with Butter Ave, which is completely MEH.  But still, the lemon meringue croissant just looks so pretty!! I wanted it. At $5.60, it was definitely more expensive than I expected.

I don't usually do my reviews this way, but this pastry was so modular, I'm going to do a modular review:

1. Croissant - Just fine. Nothing special. Not the most buttery, not the flakiest, not the most golden - this was a plain, middle of the road croissant. Grade: C
2. Lemon Curd - Just fine. Lemony enough. Good texture. Not overly sweet. But just ok. Couldn't really tell if this is piped into the croissant or if they cut a channel, but either way, there could be more of it. Grade: C+
3. Meringue - Not really meringue. Meringue has that nice shell to it, that unique textural element of torched meringue crust giving way to the soft meringue interior. Like a crusty cloud! I wish I'd gone to pastry school right now to have a stronger meringue vocabulary, but I eat enough of the stuff to know what I'm talking about. This is not meringue, this is like  marshmallow fluff. Torched marshmallow fluff
is not meringue. Why does this matter? Because actual meringue adhers to a pastry - it becomes part of the pastry.  Whatever this stuff is, I don't know, wannabe meringue, just sits on top and falls off - as this did - 2 bites in. That's right, the meringue slid off onto the ground. It was so fast, it got all over my jeans too, there was nothing I could do to stop it. See pics. Grade: D

I reviewed this modularly, as it is what it is - a croissant, with some lemon curd, and some meringue-esque topping. This does not make a lemon meringue croissant, as that would involve the components melding together into  greater whole and not falling on the ground. 

Pretty disappointing.   Overall grade: C-

What this croissant would cost in any other city: $3.50. 

What it should cost here, assuming actual meringue: $4.50 tops. 

In its current state, with faker meringue: not really worth buying. Hope that they can improve their meringue and their meringue adhesion in the future.",0.0

"Wings are tasty, but range from small to average sized, but single serve portions are small (7-8 pieces).  Comes with fries, 2 celery sticks and two carrot sticks.  Fries are tasty, but I came for the wings.

Tuesday half price deal is only for single serve wings. One drink, one half priced single served wings.  I know that's how the deal is worded, but the last time I ordered, they let two people share a three pound order. To strictly enforce the deal and say the terms of the deal right when you sit down took my excitement away. Only one sauce? Only one pound? I guess if you order a pitcher, they may give you two pounds. I wanted two pounds but only one drink this night.  I think it's smarter to just let one person order two pounds right off the bat, then maybe I'd be more likely to stick around and order more drinks. Note that service here is sloooowwwww, so you will most likely be on your second drink before the one pound comes out. That's another reason they should just let you order two pounds right off the bat.

Anyway, I left disappointed with only one pound and one flavour eaten. Also, the server came back twice not knowing the order.  However, she did explain that she was new. She gave us dill sauce instead of blue cheese. She mixed up our orders so my companion ate one of my wings! Ughhh lol because there's only one pound per person, I got possessive over my pound. 

The layout of the place isn't attractive, tall daunting ceilings, minimal character, the vibe is very detached. It feels like a warehouse rather than a restaurant or bar.  If you sit by the doors during the winter on either side or the middle, you will be very uncomfortable with wild gusts of wind blowing every time someone comes in.

"I had the opportunity to visit Terminal 4 of this airport during a connection. I was able to walk around the entire airside seeing all of the concourses.

I arrived into Concourse D. Coming off of the plane, the jetway was so hot. It was similar to that feeling whenever you open the oven and the heat waves out. Thankfully, PHX is well air conditioned once inside the terminal. Concourse D was very nice and seemed new. There was plenty of seating and a good view of the airfield at the end of the concourse. There were a couple shops and a couple of restaurants as well.

The connection between the concourses was a different story. They're kind of old and drab. There are good views of the planes but the connectors are very long. There are moving walkways so the walk isn't so bad, but some were out of order whenever I was here. They had several staff on carts taking people back and forth from gates, which helped tons of people out. Both wings of Concourse C were similar to Concourse D, except with less options and was less open. I found the terminal to be very crowded but there was still plenty of seating.

The American side is similar to the Southwest side. Very hot and crowded. There are tons of eating options. Not so good views since it is on the wrong side of the airport for that. Had some good views of downtown. Was still hot despite air conditioning due to the amount of people passing through.

"Decent food for reasonable prices-especially $2 taco night. Got 3 $2 tacos, which come with free beans and rice if you order 3+ tacos, though 3 tacos was super filling. Although on $2 night (Tuesdays and Thursdays) they only let you pick from a select group of tacos, the ones I had were good-nothing mind blowing, but solid, tasty tacos.  Unlimited free chips with 3 salsas was also a plus.  I ordered the soy chorizo tacos and a Port-queso-I really like the Port-queso, which had mushrooms with a cheese sauce topped with a yummy chimichurri sauce.  The soy chorizo was tasty-you'd never know you weren't eating meat-and the fresh avocado really added to it.  The beans and rice were good as well.

"I was served alcohol even though I ordered an non-alcoholic drink.
It should have been an sparkling orange drink (orange juice + soda water) as I pointed it out on the ""Non alcoholic beverages"" section of the menu. 
But when it arrived, I could smell and taste alcohol. My date guesses it was vodka.
I do not drink alcohol as part of my religion so I feel like this is akin to serving meat to a vegetarian. 

While a number of kitchen staff dropped off our appetizer and main course, I didn't see our actual server until it was time for the bill. So I couldn't ask for a water, tea, etc. 
My date and I could tell based on the $7.00 cost that it couldn't possibly be what I ordered.

Once again, we couldn't find our server. I didn't want to make a fuss in front of my date so we paid and left. Instead I sent a long email to the manager regarding this. He replied that I should contact him. I just did, by email, I explained. Then he replied again and asked that I call him. I left a voicemail and never heard back.

"Called & was quoted for simple tooth extraction. Son took off work to take me there. After quick x-ray, Dentist said the tooth I was having pain in was okay, but that another tooth needed root canal. I'm getting dentures soon & needed the painful tooth extracted. Dentist refused to extract that tooth & sent me away with script for Amoxicillan after charging me $55.00 for 10 minutes.. Two wks later, I was in the worst pain I've experienced besides post major surgery and labor pains. My jaw became red & swollen. Had to find another dentist, who extracted tooth (it was totally decayed under the gum\/in the root) bcuz it couldn't be saved. Had to be put on Keflex, Euganol packing, & antibicterial prescription mouth rinse. I'm lucky I didn't end up in the hospital.

"Mani and Pedis are a usual for me. Unfortunately this place was just mediocre in my eyes. The place was smelly, and not the typical nail salon smell. I'm not sure what it was, but it wasn't the greatest scent in the world, and I wasn't fond of it. I was previously warned about the scent before attending this nail salon, but I figured,  I'd the it a whirl. Sure enough, it was true.   The work done was also just mediocre. French tips, Square is a pretty basic and simple request. Although I have high exceptions, I do believe the place could have been a bit more cleanly. The staff could have been a bit more friendly.

We scheduled and appointment for a transmission pan leakage.

We got charged $70 to be told what we already knew. No job was completed, no service was provided but we ended up paying for it. We called the 800 number and spoke to somebody who explained that it was a consultation and we cannot be refunded the money because the email confirmation for the appointment says it's only a consultation. No such verbiage or explanation in the email or on their website when you book the appointment. It only said that if the problem is not what you have provided, they will adjust the quote to reflect it. We were under the impression we are paying for the car to get fixed since we already knew what the issue is. If they knew they don't do transmission work why even take on the  job?? It's dishonest to charge for a service you haven't provided. Horrible experience. They denied us a refund. Please beware of this business' practices and save yourself the headache and the money!

"So Spoonful happens to own a number of AYCE buffet restaurants under their belt. I've been to this location in Brampton two times before and we enjoyed both visits so when my in-laws came in from out-of-town we thought we would treat them here.

It started off with the four of us waiting at the front counter for 5 minutes. No one was there. I mean no one. It's noon time on a weekday so possibly they might have been busy? So I walked into the hallway and someone finally met me halfway to seat us. I'm still thinking at this point that they must be very busy and that their large seating area is full. When we were seated, I took a quick look around. There were only 10 people in the eating area. Just 10!

The Service: Well the last paragraph sort of sums it all up but I wanted to add that the servers don't clear your plates quick enough. It's not nice to stack your own plates and wave a server over once you finally made eye contact.

The Food: Presentation of food is nicely laid out. Grilled and cooked food in the back, apps on the right, and an entire dessert area on the left. I give them points for their dessert station. There are single stations that hold different types of candies. They also have a carousel that holds several tubs of ice cream that is really cool but just beware that you have to wait until a staff member is available to serve you.

The apps: Lots of choices from salads, fruit, and shrimps packed on ice. Pretty standard like most AYCE buffets where you have to get your own food.

Grill\/Cooked food: I have a big issue with this part. Most of the food I wanted were less than half full almost the whole part of my lunch and it had been untouched so it makes me wonder just how long the food had been sitting there. The grilled food had only about 2 or 3 pieces of each type of food baking underneath the hot lamps. It's almost as if you're biting into beef jerky. The sushi and maki tastes fine BUT when they post a sign that you are limited to taking only a few pieces at a time really annoys me. Besides, could someone tell me how the heck I'm supposed to enjoy sushi if I can't dip it into the soy sauce??? (shaking my head!)

Unless I'm absolutely desperate, I will not return back to Spoonful.

"Was in the area and hungry, so I we decided to give this place a try. 

This location is at the corner of Cactus and Paradise Valley Parkway in a shopping center with Target and REI. Parking is shared with all the businesses in the shopping center, but there is plenty of parking spaces to accommodate all the customers in the area. 

From the outside, this place appears to be much larger then it actually is. When we got inside, it was very busy and almost every table was occupied. Asked the hostess how long the wait would be and she was able to seat us immediately. Note, this place is only open till 2 pm and we got there at 1 and it didn't die down any within the hour we were there. Not sure if they actually stay open past that though, as people were still coming in 5 minutes before closing time. 

Once seated, we only had to wait about 5 minutes before our waitress came by and took our order. Both of us just got water, so she was able to bring it to us immediately. However, our food order took about 15-20 minutes to come out. I ordered the Roasted Turkey Sandwich ($10.49) which is a double decker of house roasted turkey, lettuce, tomato, and mayo on rye bread and came with a side of fries. I was very disappointed with the sandwich! Bread was good and toasted perfectly, but the turkey was dry and had no flavor. Lettuce was wilted and little to no mayo on the bread. Fries were tasty, but were not crispy at all. Definitely wouldn't order this item again. My date ordered the Ranchero Chimichanga ($11.49), which is filled with Pork confit, ranchero beans, home fries, and cheddar cheese rolled up in a flour tortilla and fried crispy. Topped with chorizo cheese sauce and served with your choice of side. He got the fries. He said it was very tasty and would get it again. However, the size is very large, so he was so stuffed after eating the Chimichanga, that he wasn't able to even touch the fries. 

Our waitress came by only once to check to see if we needed anything else and to give us our check. It was a good thing we didn't need anything, as she was very busy with half of the tables and people always asking for more stuff. Even though she was very busy, she always greeted her customers with a smile. I could tell she was tired, but still she worked as hard and as efficiently as possible.

Tables were immediately cleaned off and set up for the next customers to be seated, floors also were constantly swept. However, the ladies bathroom was another story. Trash was overflowing on to the floor and it needed to be swept and mopped as there was water all over the floor! Toilet paper also needed to be refilled.

"Honestly I thought coming here for a facial would be a great experience due to the positive remarks on yelp, but sadly I was mistaken. In fact it's very odd how Holly does her facials. She had explained to me that she would do an enzyme treatment but that I would start noticing breakouts after the facial. She explained that she would not extract all my black heads\/ white heads right away she wanted the blemishes to be more visible so that she could extract everything on my second visit. Most aestheticians get all the extractions in one visit. Even the most experienced aestheticians said it was very odd and it's just a way to get me to come back a second time. I've only gone to her twice now but after using her product my skin didn't react very well... I started noticing redness on my cheeks and nose when exfoliating which I've never experienced before, which led me to not go back at all. I've even broken out in areas of my skin that have never had any breakouts what's so ever.

They definitely need to work on some things! Service is slow. Food is coming out subpar...I had the Asian Chicken Salad.

We sent some things back and they tried to correct it which was appreciated but at that point we needed our check. This also seemed very confusing for our server to spilt..

"Went here last week with 3 toddlers 2 adults and 1 senior.   It was ok I guess. Very pricey trip but the kids had fun. We were basically there from opening to closing.  Depending on which exit you leave, you could end up waiting a long time to get out, I'm guessing it wont be as bad if you don't wait until after closing time.  

We were mostly in the kids section, and there were few rides that you had tot wait a bit for ,but overall I would say it was not too bad.

The drink plan is a good one to have, but the dining plan was not good for us.  I find it was not very easy to use them as well, as certain locations, you can only get certain type of items.  I believe at subway you can only get veggie.  But to my surprise, the food was actually pretty good.

Theirs was a typical slapdash pizza- covered in heavy cheese (which leads to a heavy sheen of oil), sprinkled heavily with powdered basil, with a slice of roma tomato on each pizza slice. A Margherita pizza is a special thing, and it's *SO* easy to get right that when you get it wrong, it's a huge turnoff for me. It's not that tough- start with a good sauce, put a few dollops of good mozzarella, and a few leaves of fresh basil. Booyakasha. Not this overcheesed, oily monstrosity.

"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS FLOWER SHOP!!!!!
My husband ordered flowers for me online for my birthday @ 6:00 am in the morning. He SPECIFICALLY STATED ON SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS ON ORDER to be delivered by 1:00 pm that clearly shows in receipt that they charged us. I leave my office @ 3:00 pm Guess What? NO FLOWERS!

I immediately called my office advised my staff to not accept the flowers. To advise the delivery person to take them back to shop. My front office was confronted by a very rude person demanding names and left flowers sitting on counter in the waiting room!!!!!! @ 3:40 in the afternoon. I have since called Christine and advised her I do not appreciate nor is it professional to harass my staff when your business caused this issue. She kept repeating that she is out of the shop and she will be calling us back. I said ""you will be refunding our money, send your driver back pick up the flowers now.""

Then the front door.. then the video camera doorbell stopped working... then the garage door showed up when it was closed (and if you tried to close it, it was actually open the door).. what a nightmare!

Some could argue that I shouldn't have brought my drink into the store, but no where did I see a sign for ""no outside drinks or food"" on the door or walls. He did NOT apologize for the choice of words that he used to accuse me with and went on to accept my money.

The store has well equipped restaurant style kitchen, but they cannot offer impressive food. I wish they could hire an experienced cook and start offering such food that would bring people for their food a few times week, but I am not hopeful at all.

Food is pretty good but the service is beyond terrible! We have gone three times and each experience has been worse. Today we were the only people dining and we had to keep asking for water etc. It seems that the restaurant never has any adults around just inexperienced wait and hostess staff.,0.0

"I think there are a few reasons that Rol San is one of the most reviewed spots for Dim Sum in Toronto (location, amount of seating, location, they offer Dim Sum all day, and location).

Is it the best DS I've ever had? No no, it checks the boxes, looks and tastes mostly as it should but compared to some of the spots north and west of the downtown core, it's definitely nowhere near as good. I will say that they perform very well on items like Sui Mai, Har Gow, Chicken Wings and BBQ pork buns. 

Due to the fact that it's in Toronto it follows why the price per order is nearly 1\/3 to 50% higher than places outside the city. The average cost of a basket of items is about $5 vs $2 - 3.50 outside the city. We ordered a variety of items and our bill came to over $100 for 3 people - easily the most I've ever paid for Dim Sum @ any time of day. 

I mentioned location because it is super convenient right in the heart of Chinatown on Spadina so there is no shortage of foot traffic here, and the fact that they offer Dim sum all day AND the venue is HUGE inside, are all contributing factors as to why Rol San has such a large number of reviews (average in rating however) over most other DT TO spots.

Would I return, sure. I think there are better options in Toronto and outside the city in terms of price and quality, but if I'm in the area and get the DS itch, I'll be back

We are thankful to the manager we spoke to and took care of us, but the two hour wait and the constant mess up along with the food that came out the kitchen that was unforgiving was what had it for the experience.

"If I was able to give this place zero stars, then that's what they would get. My husband, toddler and I arrived at the restaurant around 7:15 and expected a wait being that it was a Saturday night. The wait was 45 minutes, which was expected. After receiving our pages we waited the allotted time, then went to check the status and were told we were 3rd in line and should be any minute. We were given that line 3 times by the four confused hostess' in the front. Fast forward to 9:00 pm, when my husband checked again we were told that we were skipped in the line. When the hostess told the head hostess that she skipped over us her response was, ""my bad"". We then had to wait another 10 minutes before we were seated. We sat and was greeted by a very nice waiter, he took our order and drinks and vanished. He arrived 10 minutes later with our drinks but forgot our bread and salads. Another 20 minutes later our entrees arrived, still no bread or salads. We inquired about salad and he said, ""oh I forgot about the salads and here's some bread"". The food was horrible, I ordered the Ultimate Feast which was cold and the lobster was over cooked and hard, the crab legs are cold and obviously old. My husband ordered the Roasted Main Lobster Bake, which was overcooked lobster in overcooked pasta with a watered down butter sauce, that was supposed to be a white wine sauce. The tomatoes were dreadful. My daughters macaroni and cheese was literally Kraft from the box but not as good. That was the breaking point with us, my husband spoke to the manager on duty, who was dressed sloppy and addressed many of the customers as ""boo"". The manager  seemed sincere about the problems we experienced and gave us the ""family discount"" which was $16 off our $80 bill and we still did not receive our ordered salads. Needless to say, we will never visit this establishment again, the combination of excessive wait times, lack of staff competence and horribly disgusting, over priced food there is no reason to even drive through the parking lot.",0.0
"My review is regarding the physician assistant Carol (for Dr. Ivie). The worst ever.  My issues started back on August 11 when I had an ultrasound and waited over a month to get the results on September 14. This was after multiple phone calls and messages left on her voice mail every week. Had a second ultrasound scheduled on September 29 and when I arrived for that one, the referral had never been sent. It had been scheduled 2 weeks prior. Rescheduled for October 2 and the admissions lady at SDMI had to call 3 times that day just to get it sent. With another doctors signature. Then again back to the phone tag and waiting game with the assistant. This time it took 2 weeks to get the results but I was so pissed when I called the last time, they transferred me to the triage nurse just to get my results.  A week later (October 16) Carol finally calls me back. I even left a message with the office manager about this situation and again no response. Surprised?  Not really.  Dr. Ivie is cool. Very personable and friendly but she needs to get a new assistant.",0.0

The issues I had were when we tried to pick up our tickets (we ordered from Fangando) was the terminals you use to print the tickets did not work. There were 3 and everyone seemed to be having problems getting their tickets. The concession stand was another huge issue. There were 5 lanes open and all had about 6 people standing in line. We arrived 30 minutes before our movie and got in 5 minutes before it started. It took forever to get a popcorn, onion rings, and 2 beers. The girl who took our order was having a bad day or had a poor memory. She asked us 2 times what size popcorn we ordered and 3 times if we wanted butter on it. Then she looked confused when we asked for beer, which that was another waiting game. We had to wait for a manager to come over to actually ring up the sale. She then checked out IDs AND gave us a wristband so that the ushers would know we bought the beer inside the theater.... this made no sense to me since the cups the beer were in had the movie theater's name plastered all over it. Then we were told we had to go to separate line to pick up our onion rings... this line had 6 more people standing in it. If I knew that was the case I would have never bought them.

This is about the atrocious service that I have gotten there almost every single time I've eaten there whether it is busy or not.

Food comes out in stages, side orders are either forgotten or brought out whenever they feel like getting aroud to it or just as you are finishing. Forget getting a drink refilled even once during the meal unless you ask repeatedly. The server who takes your order pretty much vanishes after that. My last visit the bill came to 75.00 dollars and I would have gotten better service at the McDonalds drive thru. I eat out a lot and have never seen service this poor.

Whether he was trying to steal it or not, that's your decision, our group has ours. After he was confronted while the bar was shutting down, he was incredibly rude.  Wouldn't you think if you found a purse, you'd give it to the security guard when you were finished performing, knowing very well people would be looking for it and asking other employees of it? Well this kid didn't, he kept it for a few hours until the bar was shutting down, even when people were being kicked out for being there too late he still had it.

"I have a Chihuahua that I rescued from the pound about 2years ago and last year she got really sick and I didn't know what was wrong. Since it was late in the evening the only place close by and open was Ann Road Animal Hospital so my BF and I took her there after calling and confirming we can walk her in. The staff was nice but that night they seemed unorganized as my first impression. When we got walked in to the waiting room for someone to look at my dog we waited there for 2hrs. By then my dog looked like she was dying and had pooped on a blanket i had brought her in because it was taking soo long. Some1 every 25min would come in and ask if we've been seen and everytime we said no and that person would appologize. It was like that for 2hrs. Finally i got irritated and walked outside demanding to know what was going on. So not by anyone telling us but by observations and hearing them talk it seemed they got charts mixed up and there was no vet dr there to see my dog and the only one they had refused to see my dog because his shift was over and wanted to go home..didnt get the name.  They actually had to call another vet dr to come in and diagnose my dog. It was ridiculous! If it wasn't an emergency we would have left already but my dog was really sick we didn't want to drive around looking for another vet it was already late. We were there so long that the vet actually closed while we were still in the waiting room. A Dr Ford finally arrived and appologized for the situation. She herself looked upset that we had to go through their un-organization. 
     So... Dr. Ford was great but the bill they wanted to charge was over $500 for god knows what and if she needed everything on that list...ofcourse i paid... we were tired, worried, and cranky. They didn't charge for the emergency visit due to the wait. They discounted something else but the bill was still $500. My dog got xrayed, fluid shot in her skin for dehydration, some pills, some tummy safe food, and some other stuff i cant remember now since this was last year in the fall sometime. Oh and they offered to wash her blanket and call me to return it... that never happened bye bye $20 blanket.
     Over all after the crazyness my dog got well and Dr.Ford was good. My dog never did go anywhere near the food they charged me for and i ended up doing a home remedy food that worked. I recently took my dog back for her shot that was due and that visit was smooth. I don't like that they take your dog away to do shots though cuz you don't know what they are doing or if they are doing what they say they're doing since previous vets i am always present and they do it where u can see them administer the shots. Its just weird. I also inquired about a baby tooth that my dog never lost and this Dr. Fields says its $15 a tooth but since THEY HAVE TO DO cleaning as well that it would be $15 per tooth plus $188 so a total of $203.00 this shit is crazy. I do feel that vets milk you for money.

"Worst customer service ever.
I had made my reservation back in Oct 2016 and I was charged a percentage of my stay (212.76). That is fine. A couple days ago I changed the reservation to someone else's name and their credit card. The hotel confirmed with me that I was owed a reimbursement from the 2016 charged and the new reservation holder would get the charged. Instead I get charged a 2nd time for the exact same thing (for a total of 425.52). So now I have been charged 2x for the same thing, even though I am not even going anymore. I was talking to reservations and they confirmed that I am owed reimbursement for both charges, so I asked them for that promise in email, as proof. Suddenly, the reservations woman is back tracking saying that she actually cannot confirm that I will receive my reimbursement because billing is closed. She then tells me that I need to call back later today, to speak to billing to actually confirm my reimbursement. The call had already taken about 30 min and she is now telling me that I have to take time out of my work day to make another 30 min call. So I ask to speak to a manager, Linda, who was still unhelpful because all she did was send an email to the hotel saying that they owe me a reimbursement and then sent an email to me with my case file # and told me that if I don't see my reimbursement in 5-6 business days, to call back with that case #.

"The day I visited there were no aggressive chompy dogs.  This should go without saying but that is not always the case at the dog park, although not the parks fault at all.

Like most parks the dogs have obliterated the grass and you can find tufts of it here and there but on a wet day this is just a giant mud pit.

Parking is fine, you can always find a decent spot.",0.0
"Came in as a walk-in on Saturday afternoon, it was empty. Alina was my tech. I'll admit I don't normally get my eyebrows done or threaded but I've had threading done at one other salon before and my experience there was way better. 

First off the good- cheap ($10) for eyebrow threading. Reasonably quick - 15minutes- I had a lot of hair to remove lol. And the turnout was ""good"" I have issues with my eyebrows (like hair unable to grow in certain places or bald spots"") so they weren't perfect but I consider that my problem - not the techs. 

The bad: my tech, And I'm so sorry to say, had really bad breath. If you're going to work as a tech who hovers over and breaths on people all day, you might want to make sure you're in good hygiene. It made the whole experience very uncomfortable to say the least. 

Another bad was how painful the threading was - yes I'm aware that that can happen sometimes - but I left with my eyelids bloodied, swollen, and in pain - and still that way a day later. My first experience was nothin like that at all - in fact I remember thinking how I couldn't understand why people said threading could be painful because it wasn't. 

I don't think I will be returning and if I did, it would be with another tech. Otherwise the store is clean and not too busy on weekends.",0.0
"We arrived Friday at 8:45 PM. Their sign said ""Open"", but the lights were off and they were closed. Their posted hours said that they were open until 10 PM.  Called the next day to see when they would close. The owner was very unfriendly and said that they don't accept Restaurant.com. coupons. We will not return.",0.0
"We had one dish not sure of the name, but it was out of this world! So tasty! Then we returned for another dish I can't pronounce and it was so disappointing. I'm getting the idea that there are two chefs in the kitchen, one knows how to cook and the other one should be busing dishes.",0.0
"I should have read the other reviews before I went to get my car smogged. On Jan. 3, the man working (I use that term lightly) was so engaged on his phone that he snapped at me when I interrupted him to get some service. He was a jerk the entire time. I was a fool to fall for the card I received in the mail. NEVER AGAIN.",0.0
"I can't say I am a fan. I came here with my Korean friends, and we have all had better for better prices. Heck, just drive down the street and get Soyo's chicken. 

First off, the service. We had never tried Bonchon's before, and we over-ordered by far. While the waitress doesn't have to stop us, I think it would've helped if she at least explained what drums and wings were and how the portions worked, especially after hearing we'd never been there before. For a party of 3, we spent $90, and she still had the nerve to ask us ""And what else do you want?"" She was sugary sweet when handing us the check, but that was the only time. 

Next, food. The chicken is not for me. There's way too much batter, the flavor is weak, and the chicken is whatever. I'd hands down go to Soyo or Mama Oh's, both of which are just a few blocks south. We also tried the kimchi coleslaw and seasoned fries. The coleslaw was nothing to be impressed with, but for 3 little cup sized portions at $10, definitely not worth it. The fries were $7 and comes with 1 tiny little dipping sauce. 

I have no intention of coming back, especially when there is a plethora of better food within a few minutes drive.",0.0
