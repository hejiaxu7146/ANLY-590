"A friend of my son goes to Valley Child Care & Learning and loves it so we picked it out to be our preschool, too. We like the big outdoor playground, the nice teachers and the healthy breakfast, lunch, and snacks they serve. My son often comes home with colorful art, learning projects, or telling me all about the music\/reading\/fun things they do. This is very different from his CA preschool, which he didn't have much to say about. 
Valley Child Learning Center is really getting my lil guy ready for kindergarten, and I appreciate that.
See ya there!",1.0

"Home run!!!
I had bookmarked this place after seeing several Yelper's glowing reviews and was lucky to spot it located in the same shopping area as where we had dinner plans. After dinner I was excited to finally check this place out. Sadly, I forgot they have ""Cornish Pasty Co"" pasty here, otherwise I would have totally cancelled dinner plans and had dinner here! 

The ambience is very nice. Loved the music selection and the comfy chairs. (Hate it when the chairs are too stiff and uncomfortable) There are a few board games and a huge chalk wall on one side for self entertainment for those who need it.

The wines we tried were all absolutely lovely. I even tried a wine flight which I highly recommend because it'll give you a chance to try some wines you'd never commit to. Win win. 

Service was very attentive and unpretentious. The guys behind the bar were fun and seemed genuinely glad to be there. At one point, the guys passed around a huge decadent platter of goodies, a variety of cookies and brownies for us to try. Now, that's what I call great service! Will definitely be back!",1.0
"Typically I'm not a huge fan of this store, but today went rather well. I went in to have my cell phone upgraded and was helped by an associate named Marcus. He was super friendly and very helpful.

"I only wish that we could give Gerber Collision & Glass more than 5 stars.  Cannot say enough positive things about the people there, the quality of their work, and their communication skills along the way.

We were in a fender bender and our insurance (Farmer's) suggested numerous places for repair.  I went through the list and selected Gerber based on the positive reviews here on Yelp.  We were not disappointed.

I echo all of the other glowing reviews and agree that they are simply amazing.  Every person we dealt with was friendly, professional, and actually interested in our vehicle getting repaired.

We will be recommending Gerber to all of our friends and family.",1.0
Was so happy to find this little spot! So cute and cozy. Great place to bring your laptop. You can eat very very healthy- which is great. Juice bar - smoothies - salads - vegan - gluten free!! Yay!! Super friendly :-),1.0
I've been here several times the food and service are always been very good. The bacon wrapped dates and tacos al pastor were really good. Definitely take the staffs recommendations on what to order.  Everything they've recommended was really good.,1.0
"What a great find! This cozy restaurant welcomed my boyfriend and I very warmly. We sat at the bar and we're expertly helped by the bartender. He explained the menu in detail along with recommendations and secret items. He also helped us with the wine list and pairing suggestions. 

As for the food, the seafood was quite fresh and good but the panseared mushrooms is what got to me along with the coffee, chocolate and nut ice cream. A unison of sweet, rich, and salty. Gosh, I'm craving it now.

This is a wonderful place with an exceptional staff.",1.0
"Love this location! The orientation of the seating area is really open, and it's rarely packed. The staff has always been friendly when I've visited and the Google Wifi is one of the faster ones I've seen @ Starbucks locations. The only downside is that the parking lot is relatively small and is shared with an El Pollo Loco next door. Come to think of it, maybe that's why it's never packed in here...",1.0

"We used 777 for a local move here in Las Vegas and couldn't be happier. The three-man crew was extremely friendly, professional and above all else, took care of the items they were moving.  They broke down both bed sets and put them back together, which was a huge time saver.  Nothing was damaged in the move and they were attentive to where we wanted the items in our new house.  I feel confident recommending 777  movers to anyone and would use them again.",1.0

"Had a great time with my Dad. Our tour guide Sam, was great! I think he and my dad are now best friends and I'm a little bit jealous lol. Only thing is this place people are calling Emerald Cave is a ""nook.""

"En voyant les avis déjà laissés, je me doutais que j'allais me régaler. Ce que je ne savais pas, c'est que tous les autres restaurants japonais allaient désormais devenir fades pour moi ! :)

De passage un soir, il n'y avait plus de place pour manger sur place. Nous décidons donc de prendre à emporter et d'aller manger le tout dans un parc pas très loin (oui c'était en plein été !)
Je reste toujours très basique d'habitude, à savoir je prends des makis ou california au saumon, des sushis saumon. Alors lorsque j'ai vu la carte hyper originale je ne savais pas quoi faire ! Et j'ai décidé de me laisser tenter et surprendre par le menu Dégustation, qui proposait un assortiment d'un peu tout.

"I always give a new haircut a few days to adjust and see what it does. I gotta tell ya, Yvonne did a PERFECT job on my hair! From the very first day it did just what I needed it too. The cut was literally just right right for my hair type. I am beyond thrilled I finally found my lady!!! Not only did Yvonne do an amazing cut but she was personable, and sweet and she made me want to hit her up to hang out like girlfriends haha she was seriously rad. I'll absolutely recommend her to everyone and most definitely be back as a regular. Thanks Yvonne!! You are awesome!!",1.0
"I love eating at Lili Cafe.. no detail is missed here!  The food is all awesome (the black bean burrito with avocado is my favorite!), great bakery treat options for dessert, a wide range of drink options (including my favorites- ""big berkey"" filtered water and locally made pressed juices) and they even have sriracha sauce which not all places have.  I seriously eat here like 2-3 times a week!  I love to sit outside when the weather is nice, but theres plenty of seating inside too.. and free wifi!",1.0
"The family that owns this restaurant also owns Li Wah, so it's no surprise that the food is delicious! The menu is large and a little on the pricey side, but worth it!",1.0
"Again very good experience. 2nd time bringing our Max (pekingese) to get his nail trimmed, teeth cleaned and a.g. cleaned. All was 'ala carte' and reasonably priced at $7 @. Which was perfect because thats all he needed.  (I prefer giving him a bath at home) The large pet stores always push you do the whole package. The lady that helped us was very friendly. They have bow and neck ties that they give to dogs that get the full service.  But the lady gave Max one. He looked so cute. Maybe next time he will get the full service.",1.0
I came here for a football Sunday. We got the $15 champagne bucket. Great atmosphere and staff. Will definitely be back.,1.0
"Wow.  Carbone really hit it out of the park.  Delicious all around. They start you with amazing house made bread with spicy salami and marinated cauliflower.  We had the fresh mozzarella and prosciutto for an appetizer. Very good. The spicy vodka sauce rigatoni suggested by our waitress was perfectly balanced. Tiramisu was very good.  Complimentary limoncello was a nice touch. Service was attentive, helpful, and friendly. Only criticism was the noise level which was worsened by the music, which was too loud.",1.0
"I came here with my friends earlier this evening for dinner. There wasn't a lot people waiting but we waited maybe about 10 mins for our table. We were seated in the party room, the one with the karaoke stage lol. Our server is a middle-aged ahjumma and she was so friendly and cheery! Is she always like that?? Lol anyway, I ordered the Steven's donkatsu (7.99) and the pieces are long and did not come with the typical donkatsu sauce. It came with a side of wasabi mayo which was still good. I also shared an order of jajangmyun + tangsooyuk combo (15.99)  - yes I know I'm a piggy what?! My friends got pork bone soup, kimchi with pork stew, and jajangmyun and they all enjoyed it. 

I also checked in for a free pop (even though I don't drink pop that often, but being Asian...I wanted to redeem a free drink lol). When we got our bill, I realized our server (the super cheery ahjumma) gave us the wrong bill. We quickly let another server know and the cheery lady came back and apologized and gave us our correct bill. 

Lastly, I find songcook has really good customer service! It's quite rare to have good service in Asian restaurants such as this one. So props to the management team for training their staff well! It definitely made our dining experience a great one! Will be back!",1.0
Walked in here on a Saturday morning while on my way to the gym. This is a tiny cafe on Dundas. This is not a sit down place. There is small bar which seats about 4 people. I got an almond chocolate croissant as they looked quite fresh. It was quite buttery and flaky. I loved the burst of almond flavour they had on the bottom. The croissant was pretty big and compared to Nadege I think it was a pretty good deal. They have an elektra espresso machine. They also had some freshly baked cookies and banana bread which I look forward to trying the next time I am in the neighbourhood!,1.0

"This was my first visit to this new establishment. I was immediately greeted at the door upon entering. I stopped by around 8 AM on a Sunday and you could tell the donuts were fresh because they hadn't put them away as of yet. I ordered the half dozen and my total ended up being around $10. It was a little more than I expected to pay for only six donuts. However, the apple fritters were probably the best I'd ever tasted. It seemed as if there were tiny pieces of apples that were hidden inside. The cronut was soft and flaky, it exceeded my expectations. Overall this is a decent place. I'd come back.",1.0
"Nice little cafe with trinkets and doodads for sale on the side. Very cool location, a converted nursery that now houses a couple of restaurants and shops in a quiet neighborhood setting. Solid breakfast offerings.",1.0
I really enjoy the customer service at Kaya.  I'm always greeted as soon as I come in and offered something to drink.  It is a beautiful and clean salon.  I have had Belle cutting my hair for a couple of years now and she is always very good to listen to what I would like and ask questions to verify.  She has given me great advice based on what I want and what my hair will do.  She is good at returning calls for scheduling appointments and if she is running behind she always text me to let me know.  I am always pleased with my cut and enjoy her personality greatly.,1.0

"We've gone to Brookside a handful of times over the years, mostly for their UFC fight nights (best in town, in our opinion).  Service can be so-so on fight nights.  We did have one specific waitress that we had three times in a tow that was just hands-down awful, that the next time we got her we were going to request someone else. Thankfully, we haven't seen her in a while and haven't had a huge issue with service since.  So on Father's Day my husband wanted to go to Brookside with his dad, who has never been.  We ordered the 50 wing deal and a few appetizers, along with a couple of beers for the dads.  We played pool as well.  We had a really good time, the waitress was attentive and kept the refills coming, food was hot and delish, and overall we had a really good time.  One of the best Father's Day my husband said.  So thank you Brookside and see you at the next UFC!",1.0

"I've only eaten one thing here -- the fish tacos -- but they're so good, I don't see the point of ordering anything else.

You get two tacos on a plate.  They're so filling that my better half and I share one order, making it a very affordable dinner for two but slightly pricey for one.  (One order is 10.99.)

It's another fast-casual restaurant (love this trend, keep them coming!), cutely decorated with a Hawaiian surfer theme.  The tables look like old-time surf boards.

Now, on the tacos:  The regular order consists of chopped grilled (not fried) tuna with a delicious cole slaw, chunks of mango, and a creamy tangy sauce, all on two corn tortillas.  (They're easy to split with someone else because each taco is separate.)

The coleslaw is worth spot-lighting, it brings satisfying texture and crunch in a healthy package (cabbage is very good for you).",1.0
"I love this place. The food is always great. It's where me and my spouse hit it off and the rest is history.  It was a great fun, fast, date choice. Nothing fancy but always a good time.",1.0
"There are so many jewelers in town, it is hard to find a good one. In the Fashion Show Mall, I did just that. Michelle at Michael E Minden was very pleasant, upfront and honest, a rarity in Vegas jewelers. I had an idea what kind of ring I was looking for but wasn't sure of the exact style. I also needed a beautiful stone. I sat in the store and discussed both items with Michelle for about an hour. She was extremely helpful and told me some options for what I was looking for. 

I came back again a week later and decided on a mounting. I had also researched some stones online and sat and discussed them again with her. Again she was extremely helpful and even told me to purchase the stone I had found online at Blue Nile because they couldn't beat the price. I ended up getting three rings custom made and they set the stone beautifully. I learned more about diamonds than I ever thought possible. 

In the end I have found a jeweler I can trust and also has some great prices. 

Now the hard part... proposing :-)! 
Thank you for a great experience.",1.0

"After 2 years of passing this place to and from work off the 215, my family and I finally decided to try this place. When we arrived, it was an interesting, yet nice theme to the building\/area. Having lived up North and in Texas, I was used to this scene and enjoyed the change from the typical Vegas restaurants. We were ""kinda"" greeted by a lot of cats roaming the area (they must get some food scraps at the end of the night or something). Regardless, my daughter enjoyed seeing those cats. If you're a dog lover, beware! Ha-ha. Anyways, while we were being seated, we got to pass the grill that was cooking all the different cut of meat...such a great sight to see all that. We didn't order any appetizers because I was getting myself prepped for the 32 oz New York Strip. No, that is not a type-o....I meant it all....32 ounces of pure, slab of cow!!! The cool thing about it is if you eat all of the steak, you get a free dessert! Though I'm not a dessert fan, it was a great deal for my family. I was especially shocked on how great the flavor and tenderness were on the steak, considering the size of it. It would be wrong to say the decor is a bit dated, because hey, it's a Western theme dang it... it's supposed to look this way!!! Overall, good service and great food. Thanks for the experience!",1.0
"I have been meaning to write a review for this place, this me I had a good friend visiting in from New York, we both were in the mood to go for something different, we took a stroll down young street and we found the dumpling Queen, I suggest if you are adventurous and not picky, then get the combination platter it will include seafood dumplings, more traditional style dumplings, both steamed and fried so there something there for every pallet especially if you're sharing, I found the restaurant itself traditional I've eaten at many dumpling place as before, the head chef is the mother and she been putting her love into all those dumplings every day for us to eat, if you're wondering who she is she is the lady in the front window cooking away, I didn't find it though I little hot inside they could use a little bit of better air-conditioning it did feel a little stuffy, but we did come on and extremely hot day, other than that the food is amazing don't miss out",1.0
"I LOVE this place!! As a native Floridian from the home of the Cuban sandwich (Tampa) I had been looking high and low for a real, authentic Cuban. When I walked in I immediately felt like I was home. The decor, the music, everything screams Miami and Cuba...Love.

The owner and the other lady working with her were wonderful. Delightful to talk to and very customer service oriented. 

Of course I had the Cuban and the owner forewarned me that it might be different than I was used to. Thing is, when I travel, in most places I don't expect to find REAL Cuban bread which if you don't know, makes a Cuban sandwich. 

The sandwich was amazing, exactly what I had hoped for. Perfectly marinated pork, just the right amount of topping and cheese and perfectly pressed. She also brought out a chipotle style dip that she made to go with the sandwich that gives it a little extra something. I dipped into it a few different times and it was awesome but for the most part I stuck with the original because that's what makes me feel at home. 

One more thing....the owner is by trade a graphic designer and has lots of cool art and jewelry for sale as well.

"Two Words: MUST GO!

I have probably been here 20 times. It is THAT good.  I am lucky enough that every time I go, I get a seat everytime. I have drove by where I see a line forming outside (yikes!).It is not exactly a ""take-you-out-on-a-first-date"" atmosphere, but it is more of a hole-in-the wall. 

There are an array of dishes and one can easily order one too many dishes! So, I will provide you with my ALL-TIME Favorites:

Roasted Duck - Crispy skin and thin meat
Chicken Rice Porridge - creamy bowl of congee
Combination Chow Mein
BBQ Pork

I have tried many items on this menu and I can tell you that their dishes are high quality. This is not exactly healthy, but the food here is very authentic and consistent! For the quality of the food, it is quite inexpensive. Trust me, I have been here 20+ times!

Service is great and fast! If you come here and there is a line, go next door for some happy hour drinks or just wait!

"Man I'm so happy I discovered this place.  The same owners used to run the ""Original Greek Gyro"" in Cuyahoga Falls and I was very sad when that closed.  I went a year without a decent Gyro.  We were in Medina on some errands and looked to Yelp for a lunch idea and this place had the ratings to draw us in.  As soon as I got inside I recognized the faces, the food, and the decor.

Order the Gyro, it's the best one I've ever had in my life.  I get the platter because it's like three Gyros in one big plate.

There was a promotion in the front of the menu, and we thought it applied to us, and it may not have, but Bryce took care of us anyway because he realized the wording was confusing.

The last few times I have been to this location I have noticed that the people are extraordinarily friendly.  The employs are all smiling and seem to do the little things that make you feel like they care about your business.  We tend not to eat at chains, but the people at this store have a sincere way about them and will walk over to you to make sure you are finding everything okay.  The food is good like you would expect from a Pei Wei.

If you like Chinese American food Pei Wei is a nice mix.  There is always plenty of fortune cookies and chopsticks.  It is a clean place and it is fairly fast, without tasting like fast food.

AJ is awesome. Answered his phone at 8:30pm when EVERY other mobile RV repair didn't. Helped diagnose over the phone and gave a quick temporary fix. Called me back later that night to follow-up and see how the fix went. Then worked me into his busy schedule and came out to the RV park for the permanent fix. Definitely our guy to call for RV repairs in the Phoenix area.,1.0

We were not disappointed! I had the #1 (6 wings, fries and a drink) with ""medium"" sauce. Not only were the wings big but I got 7 wings in my basket. The wings have a very light flour dredge ans nicely sauced. The shoestring fries were very crispy but not overcooked at all and nothing was greasy. Only thing I saw missing was a selection of ""good"" beer but they did have some Bud products. I decided to hold off until we got to Boulder Dam Brewing.",1.0

I can't say enough good things about the range staff.

The fried chicken is delicious. Its crunch and juicy and has both a savoury and sweet vibe to it. Its just magical. I will dream about it until I have more. 

Also ordered the oysters (fresh) and the dirty nachos which were so simple yet so good - the best part is that there weren't those lonely, cheeseless nachos at the bottom - every nacho was smothered in the delicious cheese sauce (think movie theatre cheese but real).

Always appreciated!",1.0
"Awesome customer service. They're always busy but the wait is definitely worth it.  You'll truly get honest and upfront mechanical service with great customer service.  Island Auto upholds ""integrity"" to its fullest. Kuba the owner is a pretty awesome owner,  willing to go above and beyond for his customers!  Our vehicle needed an alignment on top of mechanical repairs so out of generosity he coordinated it with a local tire shop nearby to get the alignment completed so it was a one stop shop for us.  We didn't have to get the car from him then go somewhere else and get things taken cared of.  He took care of us so I have no problem leaving the best rating and review I can and wish I could do more to take care of island auto!  I do share and refer them a lot and have had friends go there for oil changes, engine check light assessments, anything mechanical. They do honest work and an honest mechanic is truly hard to find!!",1.0

"This place has been around forever! The owner here is the son of the one in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong won had a Michellin Star at one point and then in recent years have been on the recommended list. It's pretty solid.

What keeps me coming back (aside from the awesome wontons) is the value. 5 bucks you get a bowl of noodles and 4 massive wontons. Flavor is spot on as usual.

Tea is self-service. People talk a lot about the lack of service in this place but I'm not sure what they are expecting. This is a wonton place - it's like the equivalent of a street vendor. How do you want to be catered to? You are also eating a 5 dollar bowl of noodles...what are you expecting...

This place is also super fast. You get your food within 2 mins from ordering. I eat pretty fast so if I pushed it, I could sit down, order, eat, pay, all within 7 minutes (I've timed it before).

Awesome place if you are looking for some authentic Cantonese food.",1.0
"My lady and I had a fantastic evening here this summer. The roast pork was awesome and was even able to eat some of the catfish nuggets - and I don't even LIKE fish! They have good beer selection, although there's no light in the cooler(by the hostess stand) which makes it look like it's broken. Good cocktails, great food, welcoming ambiance. It's a great addition to Cleveland and it's reputation and praise are well earned. My only complaint is that the high ceiling and hard surfaces make the dining area loud when it's full.",1.0

"This is the second location for Showboy. I never made the trek to their Henderson spot, so I'm glad they opened up this one off of Haulapai, just south of Summerlin. The glitzy, elegant interior lives up to the Showboy name as it looks like the lobby of a theater.

Most of the cupcakes I've had have been excellent. Chocoholics will love ""The Director"" for its rich, sweet chocolate overdose of both cake and buttercream or ""The Emcee"" with its thick, sugary German chocolate topping. If you want something lighter, ""Lemon Minnelli"" is a must. The tartness and subtle sweetness  of the vanilla cake and lemon cream cheese was a nice contrast to the heavier chocolate cupcake. ""Strawberry Champagne"" was another great, fruity option and the ""Wonderland"" was a good take on a carrot cake cupcake with enough spice in the cake to balance the sweet orange blossom cream cheese topping.

My least favorite has been ""Cookies N Green."" I'm typically a fan of mint chocolate, but the mint in the buttercream was too much.

Despite that, the beautifully decorated and creative desserts Showboy produces makes this one of my top cupcake destinations.

"I love chicken. I love waffles. But I never cared for the whole chicken and waffles thing as a dynamic dual. It's almost always been hey the chicken was delicious but the waffles were meh or vice versa or they were both complete crap. So of course as people hyped Bruxie up I really didn't feel like I was missing anything. But having finally given Bruxie a chance I'm sure glad they ain't just serving that regular chicken and waffles stuff.

Went with the Original friend chicken and waffle sandwich. For me, anytime a business mentions the word original to anything on the menu I kind of have to order it. It was pretty good. The chicken was tasty. The waffles warm and freshly made. I think that's one of the things that separates Bruxie from a usual burger or sandwich spot. I don't really know of any burger spot making warm fresh made buns usually they're warmed up or just cold. That with chili honey, cider slaw, and pouring all that syrup makes it delicious.

I'd for sure be back cause it's not just chicken and waffles. They have waffle sandwiches filled with pulled pork, pastrami, etc. Salads, bacon infused mac and cheese, waffle desserts, waffle fries. I kind of want to go back now.

I dont wanna wait over an hr for the oyster bar anymore n make the trip to the strip as often as i'd like so i was super excited to hear that santa fe station, which is like literally down the street from my house, is opening up an oyster bar. Ive been to al's oyster bar at orleans, n the oyster bar at harrahs and lemme tell u, its all about palace stations' AND santa fes'!!!!!

On one occasion my husband wanted to order a particular lamb dish and the manager actually told him that he did not want to sell it to him b\/c it wouldn't be as good as it should be due to a delivery error from the food vendor. He then recommended another dish that was fantastic. The portions here are also generous and we never have room for dessert. I also love the fact that it's BYOB. If you haven't tried this place, do it now! You won't be disappointed.",1.0
"I wasn't sure if Uber was allowed at the Montreal Airport so I decided to try the 747 bus. Definitely worth the 10 (Canadian) dollars--clean, easy transportation from the airport (YUL) to the city center. I suppose a taxi might be a hair faster if you aren't going somewhere along the 747 route, but that comes at a price (~$45 for the fare+tip). And if I'm gonna be a good steward of the company's money without a major inconvenience, I'll take the bus.

Online it says you can pay on the bus, but I didn't have Canadian cash so I bought a ticket from the kiosk in the arrivals area (just outside customs). Walk outside and there's a line of 747 buses, get in line and they depart as they fill up. At least that's how it worked for me, arriving around 6pm. Looks like others have had to wait awhile to depart. Make sure to validate your ticket at the front of the bus as you get on--just hold it over the ticket reader until the display says tire good to go.

Read up ahead of time to find what stop you should take, the stops aren't displayed or announced on the bus.",1.0
First time in. Food was amazing.  Portions were large. Atmosphere was nice. Had an enjoyable lunch and didn't feel rushed. Everyone was personable. The turkey and dressing tasted homemade and the gravy was light and flavorful. Mashed potatoes were creamy and hot.,1.0

"I love me some Rocky's once in a while - their pizza is always spot-on and the various restaurants are mostly consistent.   This location does not disappoint - it's larger than others, so you can find a table off in a quiet corner if you need one.  It's pretty clean and the staff were friendly enough.  The salad bar ingredients were pretty fresh and tasty.

For me, this is a nice meet-in-the-middle location for lunches with folks working in other areas.",1.0
"La Rosa's pies are simply wonderful! The quality of their cheese and sauce go a long way to making a tasty pizza that is unique compared to the many bigger franchises in the area. Though they are marginally more expensive than let's say... Pizza Pizza, I would gladly pay the premium. The only reason why I didnt give them 5 stars is cause being so close to La Rosa has made keeping my slim figure increasingly difficult. Then again I'd rather be fat and full than thin and unsatisfied!",1.0
"This ranks among my top 3 favorite restaurants in Madison for good reasons:  Quality food, nice environment, incredible servers and a caring owner.  The meat is local, and there is so much effort put into menu choices. The drinks are magic, but pricy. When people complain we don't have good local restaurants, I send them here or the Alchemy.  Great for brunch.

If you don't have a reservation, consider going to the bar and ordering, while watching local hipsters flirt.",1.0
"So I came in on a Saturday to try the food. And I was dreading about having to wait in line for too long. Or that maybe they would've ran out of something by the time I get to the front of the line. To my surprise it wan't that busy. There was a substantial amount of people to make a line. But not bad enough that you have to wait for an hour to get food. The place wasn't too bad . You had enough room for tables and a queuing line without too much cramming.  

I grabbed a large Chicken Plate and a Beef Gyro Plate (because that's just how much of a fat *** I am) and the process was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Usually with hype places like these there would usually be an overwhelming menu where the good stuff is only like one or two and the rest is just there but no. You choose from either Chicken or Beef or Falafel or Chicken and Beef. Add the Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Rice and your all set. 

Okay so on to the food. The Chicken was by far the better out of the two plates. It has that grilled aroma to it and the flavor was actually good. Not salty at all, not bland as well. They offer a white sauce that you can put on top of the plate for better flavor but the plate itself doesn't need it if you wanna stay on the healthy side. 

The Beef Gyro was soft, not chewy at all. Could use a little salt in my opinion but you don't have too really. The white sauce does tie in nicely but too much of the white sauce kinda ruins it for me since I can't taste much of the food after I accidentally smeared the whole packet of white sauce onto the plate. The lettuce and tomato, I would probably hold off on it the next time I visit. Don't get me wrong, there's absolutely nothing bad about it. Its just they put too much for my taste and my fat *** doesn't feel like eating a salad. 

They also offer a hot sauce which is REALLY hot! I didn't believe what the packet was telling me when it said ""Its really hot"" so yeah I put on a good amount and it burned. But the nice thing about the hot sauce is that the kick is good. The flavor of the food is still there. Unlike other hot sauces where all you can taste is the hot sauce itself and then comes the burn. Theirs actually start off with a nice kick along with the flavor of the food. And then you get to the second or third spoonful and you regret having put too much of it on one plate. 

Overall, the food is pretty awesome. I probably wouldn't be hankering for another plate since the two I had would probably last me all the way to next week but I wouldn't have a problem coming back another time. I actually look forward to try the Falafel next time since my dad always tells me to go and try it. I will probably edit this review in the future for that. But for now I would recommend this place for those who are looking for something healthy and flavorful and those who are looking to get their grub on and just lather the plate with their signature white sauce. 

Parking isn't a problem during peak hours but I would probably try going on Wednesday or non-peak hours so as not to end up looking for parking. Or worse, standing in a line.",1.0
"I went in to see Dr. Gettleman for pain in my root canal. Both Dr. Gettleman and his staff were very friendly, professional and informative. They took the time to walk me through the entire process and answered all of my questions with patience. I would recommend him to anyone who needs a root canal - the process was seamless!",1.0
I had a blast it was just me and my boyfriend and we instantly made friends with everyone on the bus. Everything went smoothly we got in the clubs right away and our host Cameron made sure we had enough to drink on the bus. Found the deal on groupon.

Good place to go and grab dessert and relax. Go there 2-3 times a month and have always seen some new dessert. Prices are what you would expect. Much better environment that Starbucks. Not a five rating because I have had some of the drinks that were not really anything special\/ had a tea that was basically water. Go get some cake!,1.0

"I absolutely love Pizza Hut! My personal favorite is what we would call in the Philippines as a Hawaiian pizza, a regular Pan pizza with pepperoni, ham and pineapple. 

I've ordered a few times from this particular location before and they have been awesome. All the workers have been nice and attentive.

I think my Hawaiian pizza works best with a medium size as opposed to the large because pineapples might add a more wet component to the pizza? It was still so good, though.

"I was very impressed with this stadium. 
The upper deck seats are a little steep but that is normal for most stadiums. 

There was an abundant amount of space in both the upper and lower concourses. This allows for an easy flow of people. Having been in many other stadiums, this was a treat compared to the usual crowded ways 

There were lots of concession stands. 

The only down side, is that there is almost no parking around the stadium. Do yourself a favor and take the trolley",1.0
"Great Burgers! I don't normally eat nor like eating burgers however I have recently had a craving for a juicy burger and this place definitely quenched that cravings. Eventhougb atmosphere isn't the greatest, if my friends ever want to grab a burger I'd definitely recommend this location. Burgers are big, juicy and flavourful! The fries also are big and they use fresh potatoes that have been cut and fried. It is not crowded or too busy so the wait does not take long. Writing this review and thinking about that juicy burger is making me crave it again. Can't wait to return and try out their poutine next time!",1.0

"As always, a consistently good meal. Their BBQ sauce is a major draw and I had a healthy option lunch but had them do my chicken in the sauce. 

They accommodate and service is above average. We ate outside and the patio is tight which is a drawback. The other drawback is that the AC units are just plain loud. 

The noise didn't necessarily ruin the experience, but you would think they would find a way to buffer. Other than that, it's a good place worth a visit if your in the falls.",1.0
"Craft 64 is a great place. A friend recommended we go there and so I checked out the reviews. They were all great and the restaurant didn't disappoint in real life. We had the Aji pizza and the Sausage pizza. Both were excellent. Their special over really helps make excellent crust that is an integral part of the pizza. The ingredients are fresh and some pizzas are traditional while others are unique, so you can find something that's interesting to you. The Aji pizza is incredibly hot, btw! So be prepared if you go with that choice. My friend had a bunch of beers and said they were all really good. In fact, they have a very big craft beer selection. The cherry on the top was that the owner and chef stopped by our table and took our order so we were made to feel right at home. This is a great place!",1.0

A little weird to pair beer and ice cream, but a good way to try both.  The ice cream is made in house and is soooo good.  Also very different flavors and conbinations but very tasty.

"DJ Eric Smith of the Cleveland Music Group did an awesome job at our wedding!! There's of course some wedding classics that are played at weddings,  but I really wanted the music to reflect my now husband's and my musical tastes, and not just sound generic and like every other wedding. Our first date was to a concert, so it plays an important role for us. Eric delivered exactly what we wanted!! We met with him before the wedding (he was very flexible and responsive) and gave him some suggested songs\/artists so he could get a feel for what we liked. He then created a playlist that was absolutely spot-on! The guests definitely noticed too because all night I kept getting comments on how great the music was and there were always people on the dance floor! We also liked that he wasn't over-the-top\/cheesy in his emcee role. Our venue was unique in the sense that it was an indoor and outdoor space, but Eric maneuvered that perfectly as well.  

Even the initial planning was easy! We met with the owner Scott Jones, who was so nice and accommodating. Very professional as well. When I mentioned we were interested in Eric, Scott had Eric come to part of first meeting so we could meet him too. Afterwards, as we were making our decision, Scott would follow-up but was never pushy like some other companies I made inquiries with. He understood that it gets very busy when you're juggling work, wedding planning, and other personal commitments and gave us the time we needed. 

Overall, we couldn't be happier and would highly recommend both the company and Eric!",1.0
"My husband, my two son's and myself went to this location on Southern to use my buy one with a beverage, get one free for my birthday (which was yesterday, the day we visited this location). 
The restaurant was busy but with two sides to go through the salad buffet; we went through it rather quickly. The cashier was nice and helpful. We found a booth and as we were hungry, we turned our attention to devouring our fresh salads. After consuming our salads, we went to peruse the hot foods--they had a nice selection of soups, pastas, baked russets and sweet potatoes, breads, muffins and for dessert, soft serve ice cream, molten chocolate cake, etc., 
Everything was fresh, delicious and tasty. 
The employees are friendly and our waiter kept our table cleared. He was quick and personable and he was kept very busy by the amount of people in our seating section of the restaurant.

I heard rumours of the ""lobster mountain"" before I went to this restaurant but when I actually saw it in person, I was still amazed!

I am an active person and he knows that my quality of life includes being able to run, jump, skip and hop. He helps me understand any limitations, to which he has helped me heal, and tells me how to stretch and what may be causing reoccurring issues. He is definitely thorough and will work with just about everyone through anything.

Only thing I would point out, be sure to book an appointment. He is a one man working crew and he books up pretty solid. He may be able to squeeze in a walk in, but I think it is easier to book the appointment.",1.0

"Been wanting to try this place for a long time but was never in the area of their old location. So finally get a chance since they moved to this area. The staff here are super nice and are helpful when you don't know what flavour to choose. I chose the hk milk tea and their white chocolate red bean. The price is about the same for other gelato places. They have a good amount of seating if you want to sit and enjoy. I found the flavours to not be as strong as regular Italian gelato, so don't expect that when you come here. These flavours are their own and is what makes them different. Will definitely be coming back... Maybe during a warmer season to fully enjoy it. But really... Can't complain about weather when it's yummy dessert.",1.0
The food is just wonderful. I've tried a lot of their items and not once was I disappointed. Sometimes at the end of the day they'll give you a side salad for free with other purchases. Side note: there's no AC (or at least they don't turn it on).,1.0
"I visited the newest ramen place in downtown Toronto a month after it's opened. It was a Wednesday night  and it was not too crowded. 
I heard the music could be loud but that night wasn't bad. The wait stuff was very friendly. The menu looked interesting. 
I ordered the premium pork ramen (can't remember the exact name)  with a combo with salad and 4 pieces of gyoza. The salad was good and simple. The gyozas were tasty. The ramen looked good and tasty. I did enjoyed my meal. However the portion is not big and the price is about 20% more than other ramen places in town (just for ramen,  it ranges from $12 to 15. Most places are around $10 to 12)
The taste of the ramen was good but I would need to get more to have a full meal. The pork buns look interesting. I will probably try it next time when I am there.",1.0
"Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day.

When at 3AM our extroverted fourteen year old Pomeranian urgently was going to the oddest places.  For example - under dirty clothes in the walk-in closet.  A corner of the dining room she had never ever frequented.  We knew she was looking for a place to die and took her to VECC - North.  She was euthanized in the most caring manner possible.  At the time of checking out my wife was sure our bill was $47 higher than she was told.  She was so insistent VECC gave us  a $47 discount.  We also just received a Holiday Sympathy card signed by THE WHOLE STAFF.  As a their generosity I sent $100 to cover our expense and a small donation to help someone else.  PS - Kobe is sleeping in her beautifully crafted backyard grave.  Of course she was the best Pom ever and Kobe and our family lived a charmed life for fourteen fabulous years.

"This is one of my FAVORITE places in Vegas, period! It's my Cheers. Desyreé Alberganti is a phenom when it comes to gelato. She and her team create the most inventive and inspired flavors at this dessert spot. Customers are made to feel welcome and taken care of. It's amazing how encouraging they are to get eaters out of their comfort zone by just offering up free tastes. I've had flavors that included Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Fois Gras, Chili Popcorn, Gorgonzola, and many more that I would have never even thought of in dessert period, let alone in gelato. It's such a treat to have this place in our valley. 

I think prices are very reasonable considering the high quality of the product. I'm sure the price point is such so that visitors like me really can try out different combinations that maybe we normally wouldn't. Gelatology also has long hours ideal for a post-dinner meetup.

Cutest little family coffeeshop I've been to. The atmosphere is rustic with varying instrumental music playing in the background (since my stay I've heard genres from jazz to Harry Potter). The owner always seem to strike up conversation with everyone that comes in. They also have a drive thru which is a HUGE plus for those that just want a quick local coffee fix. They make most of their baked goods in house and I've heard great things about their food. This is a great place to catch up with an old friend over coffee or to enjoy a quick lunch by yourself.

"When I was a teenager, Easy Life was just the boba place you went to because all the ""good"" places were in China Town. That was a long bus ride for some boba and even when a car was procured - who had the gas money for that kind of trip on the daily? Then, what seemed like overnight, cool hipster boba places opened everywhere, and Easy Life was left behind by many like me.

I was a fool! I came back the other day for convenience when I was craving a treat and got my usual Jasmine Milk Tea w\/boba and felt utterly blown away by how delicious it tasted. I had gotten so used to the taste of other establishments it was a completely rediscovered experience for me. I can't say they have the best boba ever, but I can say with absolute confidence their Jasmine Milk Tea is my favorite in Las Vegas. 

That being said, convenience is primary over atmosphere here! They really should have a drive-thru because they are not the first place I would want to stop for a chat.

We lucked out this time around, we tried our luck during a Sunday NFL morning which made fantasy football even better weekend for me. They have multiple TVs through out their restaurant, so you wont miss a beat. You can enjoy a great meal while catching your game that is either crucial to you as a fan, and as a fantasy football participant. They have tons to select from, whether you are hungry or just looking for a sugary treat to try. We did both, ordered a entree and ordered a dessert. For the entees we tried chicken and waffle, and chocolate chip pancakes. For the sugary treat we tried our first time experience with their mocha and white chocolate cold drinks.

Endless lobster tails, caviar, sushi, eggs Benedict, crab bisque, it's insane.  This is a seafood buffet for sure so if you don't like seafood this wouldn't be your spot.  Truffle mashed potatoes, crab legs and the most beautiful dessert display.  This is the priciest buffet that I've been to but it is worth it.  At $98 per person, I got my fills worth between the crab legs and topping it with caviar.  This brunch fills up for sure so make sure that you make a reservation or else you may not get in.  For some reason I feel like this buffet isn't as well known as the others and I'm not sure why.  Maybe they don't want to pay the price.

Prices are a little on the high side, but you get what you pay for. 

The service was just fair. The staff was not particularly friendly. As the plates of appetizers & finished sushi piled up, no one who worked there (including our server) felt it was a good idea to clear the table. It got kind of embarrassing for a while before our server finally decided she would lower herself to that of a busgirl. Not a deal-breaker, but no question the staff would benefit from more training and an attitude adjustment.

Iam very happy with the outcome of my hair. Jessica saved my hair. I came in on short notice. She opened her door to me with a smile. I tried to do my own hair and I really messed it up. She told me what I needed to do. She just didn't try to take my money and damage my hair even more. She made sure that I was happy with the outcome and she did. She made my hair beautiful again. I would tell anyone to go to her she is amazing at what she does. I will be flying to her every time I need my color fix.. Thank you so much Jessica.,1.0

Probably the best Indian food we have had in Phoenix after living in Dubai for 5 years. Wait staff is efficient and friendly. Dal Tardhka and Tandoori is good. It was a bit strange being entertained with a belly dancer and Arabic music though. Would be nicer to have Hindi music and bharatnatyam dance.,1.0
"You know what?! Although pho bang New York remains my favourite, I give this place a solid 4 stars. The resto is situated in a chomedy strip mall right next to the Adonis. Seating was cozy, restaurant presented as very clean. The waitress wasn't very helpful in suggesting the dishes, however, I vaguely knew what I wanted. I originally came because I was craving a healthy, oriental soup... That's when ""Vietnamese pho"" came to mind! I ordered the tonkinese grilled chicken pho. I have to say, the extra large is HUGE for the price! Soup was generous in chicken, vegetables and vermicelli noodles as evidenced by my picture. I definitely left this place feeling full, satisfied and remain with a heavy pocket.",1.0
"Apple and bacon pie with maple ice cream. 

Now that I have your undivided attention, let's start at the beginning. That was my dessert. 

L'Orignale is hard to find if you don't have binocular vision. It's just round the corner and into an alleyway off Rue Notre Dame (Rue Saint Alexis) in the Old City. 

This place is the perfect combination of a métis voyageur's cabin with a demon craft cocktail bar. All the waiters are dressed like Paul Bunyan with their checked shirts and all. 

The food is French and Canadian wilderness. Hearty yet imaginative. Not afraid to take small yet appreciated diversions to excite the palate. 

I knew what I wanted before I even walked in the door thanks to the street-side menu. Rabbit and foie gras parfait followed by a leg of venison steak chop whatever with a rossini sauce. I'm not going to rant on about either. 

I lie. The parfait was creamy as heck. But that was never apple jelly with it as the menu claimed. My napkin looked like Sweeney Todd's afterwards. I suspect a raspberry compote or A negative. But it was subtle, not gory. 

And the deer limb: it really looked like a tomahawk steak and claimed to be 18 ounces. But best of all, I was never asked how I wanted it. I approve. The chef should always decide how I want it. And how right he\/she was. The venison was between medium rare and medium rare. Never chewy, just the right amount of give. And not a whiff of gaminess which surprised me but did not disappoint. 

Back to the bacon, maple and apple action. It finished me off. Like a British pork pie of apples and cubes of meaty Canadian bacon (as we like to call it sour of the border) with a delightful dollop of maple ice cream on top. All I wanted was a private room where I could sink my face into it without all the judginess.

"If you have to have oral surgery Dr. Carlos Letelier  and his staff are an exceptional choice.

Had to have two wisdom teeth extracted and I must admit I had much anxieties in anticipation of the surgery.  My dentist Robert Earl referred me to Dr. Carlos Letelier.

As soon as I walked into the reception\/waiting room, a tastefully decorative 30 ft Christmas quickly caught my eye. The rest of the room had rich warm decor with heavenly angels placed in various areas.

The office staff, unlike other office's, were in business suits attire. I was greeted in anticipation warmly and expeditiously. Within a few seconds upon my arrival,  I was escorted  to the x-ray   equipment that was able to take an x-ray of my whole mouth in 20 seconds.  Amazing! No  discomfort whatsoever.   Then whisked away to view a short video explaining my procedure.  

After the video I met Dr. Letelier who gifted me with a small Christmas stuffed toy.  (A very warm greeting)

Dr. Letelier went over my my procedure with the recent x-rays and answered all my questions.  I felt I was in good hands.  After signing a few papers,  immediately I was taken to the operating area.  The medical team  preparing me worked like a fine tuned clock and yet still maintaining a friendly kind atmosphere. 

I was to be put under for the procedure,  which according to my husband took about 10 minutes.  

It is now a little less than 24 hours after surgery and I have no pain, minimal bleeding, and very little swelling.  
I have had several surgeries in the past, but this by far was the most efficient, fast, and flawless experience I have ever had.",1.0

"Messini's is a classic case of a restaurant with excellent food at a great price....with sub-par service you have to suffer through.

"Passports or family portraits? I recommend Photo Express for both!

While traveling through Edinburgh, we found out our lawyers needed passport\/visa photos from us ""toute suite"". We found Photo Express online and Toby had great reviews. Now we know why! 

Service was top-notch with a genuine care for the finished result. He even used a light reflector screen (placed beneath you) to get a beautiful sheen to your skin! Nice touch. I also loved that he took multiple shots and showed them to you (for approval) before you even leave the chair. 

I also was impressed with how Toby was able to make us smile naturally with his quick wit and disarming charm. Judging by the fabulous family portraits on the walls, it's clear that he is a talented photographer. It's no small thing to get an entire family smiling naturally but he seems to do it easily! We experienced that without even posing for a family portrait.

"This food will make everything right again what has been wrong in your life. 
Best kept secret in this town, very popular with, well, Korean people, for good reason. 
The food is delicious, beef is amazing. Some reviewers seem to have objections to the decor, but that is one of things why I feel incredibly comfortable here. Nobody mentioned what exactly bothered them, so I'll explain why I love it: warm light, calm feeling, soft music and NO TV, no people who go for dinner with their cellphone and have loud explanations what they are eating either. Luckily YELP offers a category for that that helps me: ""romantic ambience"", there you go!
Plenty of side dishes, various pickles, and to mention that: for me the portions tend to be too big to eat all at once, but for fairness I have been just once here for lunch and it's a while ago so I can't recall if the portions were any smaller or not or if there was a long wait, nothing of that sort some to mind, evenings are without any issues for what I require.

"We flew into Vegas on Friday night and Saturday morning this is where we went.  We had both picked it out on Yelp before our trip and it did not disappoint.  
We arrived at Bouchon at 9:30am.  We were told it would be about a 20 minute wait and they would text us when our table was ready.  We were able to walk around a gift shop a few step away while we waited for our table.  We were texted almost exactly 20 minutes later and were seated at a table for 2.  I was on the booth side and my boyfriend sat in the chair across from me.  
Their champagne cocktails looked delicious, but as much as I love champagne it does not love me, so I opted instead for the Bouchon cocktail.  It was good, but not great, and VERY strong.  I didn't end up finishing it.
The bread service they brought out was amazing.  It was 4 small rolls attached together with butter and jam.  Seriously, I could've eaten this and it could've been my meal and I would've been happy as a clam.  I'm drooling just thinking about them.  
For my entrée I had the waffle with apples pecans, and cream.  It was heavenly.  The apples and fresh pecans gave the waffle a freshness element instead of pure sweetness.  The apples were cooked, but not overcooked and not saccharine sweet.  However, I did find that syrup was totally unnecessary. 
My boyfriend has the Croque Madame.  It was awesome.  The sauce on this Croque Madame was out of this world and bread was delicious.  His fries were also very good.

I love how everytime I visit I get free chocolate samples. Once they were giving out smores too!

"I have purchased 4 cars from here and have always been happy with the service. I just returned from a long drive from Northern California and began having car problems on the trip so I took my car into a Honda Dealership in Valencia. I was told the Mass Air Flow sensor was out, but none of the dealerships in the entire Los Angeles area had the part in stock. They cleaned out the part and assured me I could drive on safely to Phoenix. The car continued to have problems, was difficult to start, and kept losing power. I called Tempe Honda and spoke with my service advisor Ken Smith. I explained what was going on and exchanged calls with him throughout the trip. Ken checked in on me several times, and went out of his way to find me the replacement part so I could finish my trip safely back to Phoenix. He went above and beyond what I expected.

"There are a lot of things to love about Las Vegas, but perhaps my favorite is its in-your-face artifice.  Carbone is a perfect example of this.  It's only been open for 8 months or so, but it proudly flaunts a totally phony sense of history.

Sorry, Carbone, but I see through your act.  Even with antique chandeliers and Noo-Yawk-accented staff, you're still in a trendy hotel-casino on the Strip.

Artifice aside, Carbone is actually quite lovely.  I dropped by on a Saturday night for dinner at the bar -- which is a good option if you're can't score a reservation.  (The dining room was packed solid, but the bar wasn't busy at all.)

The bartender wasted no time taking my drink order (Pinot Grigio -- my happy wine) and bringing me a whole array of complimentary goodies to nosh on, including an enormous breadbasket (with traditional, pizza, and garlic breads), pickled cauliflower, salami plate, and parmesan pieces freshly chipped off a giant slab.  It was all very over-the-top, and it put a smile on my face.

Next, I had the beets siciliana -- a simple but delicious dish of red and yellow beets.  This is also a nice, healthful alternative to the richer, more gluttonous items on the menu.

For my entree, I had the spicy rigatoni vodka, which I enjoyed, but not as much as the beets.  I was actually taken aback at just how aggressively spicy the sauce was, and the pasta itself was a bit overcooked.  

For me, even okay pasta is still enjoyable, but the main reason I was annoyed by the pasta dish is that Carbone's prices are completely out of control.  I completely understand that the Strip is a high-rent district, but charging close to $30 for a small handful of simply prepared pasta seems ridiculous to me.  I guess that phony sense of history costs mad money to maintain.  

Despite my cynicism, Carbone is still a fun and tasty place for a night out.  As I was leaving, the bartender brought out some complimentary marzipan-like cookies, which were a nice touch and made me want to go back.  Maybe it's not all artifice around here.",1.0

We spent around 20 minutes to drive around before finally locating the building, so this is something you will need to be aware of.

I had the grilled chicken and shrimp with rice and a baked potato.  I was very impressed.  The shrimp were nicely cooked while the chicken was very tender.  The rice had lots of flavor and was very pleasing to the pallet.  The baked potato was a bit small in my opinion but still very good, and loaded with butter.  The other entrees  at our table were the fishermans feast which had a nice assorment of various seafood items, the lobster linguini, and their peppercorn steak.  Everyone was pleased with their meal, although i didnt have the opportunity to reach across the table and sample them, i think thats frowned upon by some people ;)",1.0

"I went to an event where the food was Kosher. Usually for me, this means bland and unappealing. But Chef Mark food was exceptional for Kosher and non-Kosher. 

First, It was visually appealing - lovely colors, layout of the food, and so on. Not the usually tan\/brown that you get at these events.I even took photos thinking I would somehow re-create it (yes, that is never going to happen but I can pretend). 

But even better was the taste. While I am a really good baker, his Brownies are the best I've ever had. Extremely moist and tasty I thought I had would have one, but soon was trying to hide the dish from everyone else. He also had an quiche\/egg dish which was a piece of heaven. It quickly disappeared. 
And there was a lot of food! So while people had multiple servings, there was still food left out. So Mark dropped it off for a homeless shelter. So not only a great Chef, a man with a big heart.

This was my first time visiting Cantina since they moved and I enjoyed it. The decor was nice. I had the El Vaquero quesadilla to eat and it was pretty good. I also had a margarita and maybe I should have ordered top shelf (or no ice) because I didn't really feel like I was drinking alcohol. It does seems like they are a little onion heavy because there were onions in the queso (a first for me but kinda good) and I had a great deal of onions in my quesadilla so be mindful of that.,1.0

"My sister used to get her nails done by Leslie two years ago at fantastic nails, recently my sister remember Leslie saying she wanted to open her own salon so we googled Leslie's nails and we found her salon! We went there yesterday, I got a full set with gel color. Johnny put on my full set and buffed and shaped them. Now normally I have an issue with the shape of my nails, no one can ever get them perfect. I like my thin and square, Johnny shaped my nails perfectly.. And he was very quick, they looked amazing. Leslie did my gel color, which was as well done perfectly. After I got the full set, I realized they were to long for me so I asked if maybe they could shorten a little. (which I know is annoying bc filing gel can make it lift) but Leslie filed them down and shaped them back to perfect and even applied another gel top coat for no extra charge. My nails were 40. Which usually I pay 55 for full set with gel. Also, their customer service is incredible. It's like being a part of a family. This is most defiantly my new nail spot!",1.0
"Yay I'm a fan describes my feelings about this restaurant well.  My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner after it was highly recommended by a work colleague (her girlfriend is the head chef so I had high hopes!). The restaurant is small, even by Edinburgh standards so booking is essential. There's maybe enough tables to seat about 20 but it's a cosy atmosphere not w cramped one. The service staff seemed helpful and our waitress was definitely super friendly which made the evening a really nice experience.

We kept things simple and ordered the feta and pistachio dip and bread with dukkah and oils to share while we waited for our birds and beast platter. The feta dip was incredibly moreish to the point I'll need to try and recreate it at home. The bread with oils was tasty as well but the feta just really stood out. After a bit of a wait our platter arrived and I wish is taken a photo as this was no small feat ahead of us! The platter is made for two to share but could easily feed four as there's two hearty portions of everything. The platter had piri piri chicken wings, slow cooker ox cheek, a pulled pork croquette, beef shin with wasabi grilled cheese, baked beans, and Asian coleslaw. For someone who's not a massive meat eater I was a bit overwhelmed and barely made it through half of my portion.  Everything was super tasty with a nice spicy kick but I was just defeated. Thankfully the waitress offered to wrap up any leftovers we wanted so I got to take home my chicken wings and ox cheek. 

After a bit of a rest we shared the cheese platter for pudding with a peppermint tea for me and an amaretto coffee for the boyfriend. The cheese is from Mellis so it was of a standard I'd expect and the chutney was quite nice as well.  After a super filling evening we paid and left to waddle ourselves home. I definitely enjoyed three birds and will be back to try other items on their menu but I think it would help a lot if they cut down the size of their sharing platters as they're just too big for two people.",1.0
Showed as promised for both the estimate and to perform the work. Work was done completely and in a timely manner and they cleaned up their mess when done. 2 year warranty and I couldn't be happier with their service. Very professional! I highly recommend!,1.0

"Seeing Celine Dion here was amazing! It didn't take terribly long to get in or to get a drink. We got there right around 7p for a 7:30p show (which didn't actually start until almost 8p - that is the reason I'm taking 1 star off). Our seats were in the front orchestra off to the right and we had a good view of all that was happening on stage. Obviously the middle front orchestra is the best location to be, but we had no complaints. I had no idea that this theater was actually built FOR Celine Dion 13 years ago as she was the first residency they ever had. We are going back day after tomorrow for Elton John - looking forward to enjoying that performance as well!",1.0
"I went to breakfast with some friends at the Morning Glory  (The Farm) after a hike on South Mountain last Sunday.

"For those who don't already know, I have been on a hunt for the best AYCE sushi in Las Vegas. While I still have a few more places to visit before my quest can officially become complete, I can say that this is by far the best AYCE sushi house I have gone to-date. 

Telling from my experience as well as what other reviewers say, this place is always crowded with people. We sat in a small table in the center of the restaurant and we could definitely feel how busy all the waiters were getting orders around in a full house. Although there were so many customers, my date and I got out orders at a quick pace. 

The waiters and waitresses were also the most welcoming and personal out of every restaurant I've encountered so far. When a dish was served, they would always wait to see my approval before going back into the question. Someone was always there whenever I had questions to ask, and they always constantly asked me if I ever needed anything or if the food was good. 

Yes, the food was actually very good. As you may have already read, the fish to rice ratio was superb. The fish itself just screamed out FRESH, at least compared to other AYCE sushi joints. I was pleasantly surprised that they did half orders too. Not all sushi houses do that. 

One thing that I thought was very unique and cool was the fact that they put lemon on top of the salmon nigiri as garnish. It gave the salmon so much more flavor, and a bit more of a zing to it. If I ever have a salmon craving, I'll probably go here to satisfy it. 

I also liked that they had a wider array of flavored mochi ice cream. I always look for my favorite flavor, chocolate, but most places never seem to serve it either.

PS: They serve Tamago without the sticky rice! Pleasant surprise!",1.0
Can't beat the $5 movie Tuesday. The seats are nice they play current movies. No complaints here.,1.0
Saw the Yelp reviews called since we had an emergency. We had a leaking pipe in the wall in our bathroom and it was bubbling up the paint. The other companies we found couldn't come until tomorrow and we felt like it was necessary to have this fixed immediately before it got worse. Called at 9:30am they arrived at 11am. Quick service. My husband figured out that it was a screw that went through the water line when we went to hang a new bathroom mirror. My husband opened up the dry wall and the plumber changed the named and leaky pipe. The job cost $650 which I assumed seemed pricey although what needed to be done was handled quickly. We appreciate the prompt customer service. Since the job was finished we've been quoted a more reasonable price but there is honestly no price on piece of mind and the quickness that the job was handled before it worsened.,1.0

"While recently visiting Cleveland and looking for a good place to enjoy a nice meal on a Saturday night with an old friend, she suggested we check out what is apparently the hottest new spot in town. I was of course intrigued when she mentioned that they had Mexican food - as I am a huge fan of anywhere where there are margaritas and chips and salsa. 

We called earlier in the day in hopes of getting a reservation, but were told they were booked and we'd have better luck simply arriving and waiting for a table. When I got there around 7:45 I was told the wait would be about an hour for a table for three, so we promptly posted up at the bar and got ourselves a cucumber and spicy mango margarita - both of which could not have been more different or more phenomenal. The cucumber marg was cool and refreshing, a delicious summer beverage and the mango was spicy - seriously so - and delicious - the perfect pair with their guac and chips. 

We were seated in a little under 45 minutes from the time we walked in, which wasn't bad and went fast while seated at the bar, enjoying the first drinks. Immediately when we sat down we began perusing and knew we wanted some queso and guac. It took a few minutes before a server appeared and when he did we promptly ordered some cucumber guac and some chorizo queso. The queso and guac were unusual - the queso in an amazing way - it wasn't so cheesy and contained a very generous portion of sausage and onions and was served with tacos. The guac however wasn't really my jam - I didn't love the cucumbers in there and found myself eating around them. 

We got the gouda dumplings which were unlike anything else I've ever tasted and were amazing. We also tried the shrimp taquitos which came in a sauce that was literally unreal - seriously I was dipping my chips in it and would have eaten it with a spoon. We also go the brisket tamales which were good, but a little sweet for the mood I was in that night and not enough relleno sauce in my book. We also got a side of beans and rice and I rarely say this, but the rice was heavenly with some lime on it - seriously the best white sticky rice I've ever had. 

The prices for the quality and portions were great - for two apps, two drinks, three side dishes and two mains we paid $90 and took home two large to go boxes because we just couldn't finish everything. This place is 4.5 stars, just can't give it the full 5 because the service was a little slow and I didn't dig the cucumber guac.",1.0
"Came here for a friend's Bachelor party and it was freaking amazing! This was a few years back so I can't remember the artist playing but it was EDM.

Good drinks, great venue and good times! If I go back to Vegas I'm definitely coming back.",1.0
This place is great!! I had the green chili beef wet burrito which was very spicy and has tons of flavor. You can tell they slow cook their meats with various chili's. Skip the local and national chains and come check this place out! I'm so glad this place opened in my neighborhood!,1.0
"Made a reservation for ~6:45pm on a Friday and the restaurant was surprisingly only half full. The entrance of this place reminds me a lot of the restaurants in downtown Montreal. Inside, it's dim, mellow, and calm.

We were first served with bread and some hummus. I personally love hummus but I know plenty who don't, such as my friend who came with me. Would have been nice if we were offered butter or some other choices.

We ordered a cocktail (gin and cucumber), lamb shank, and cornish hen. Hands down the most amazing cornish hen I've ever had. The skin was crispy and flavourful, the meat was tender and juicy. Vegetables provided on the side were delicous too. I loved dipping the hen into the sauce on the plate. Friend's feedback on the lamb was 2.5\/5. I tried a piece and agreed with him too. It tasted like any other lamb dish you find at a decent restaurant, nothing stood out. The size of the food is definitely reasonable for what you pay. Both of us could not finish our food.

Also, I loved the cocktail! 

Service was good, we never had to ask for our water to be refilled. Our server came around every 10-15 minutes.

The restaunt was quickly filled with people at around 7:30pm. Great spot for a date night!! Would be back again for other cocktails and the cornish hen.",1.0

"Discovered this place awhile back when family was staying at the hotel down the road and we wanted somewhere within walking distance. Thank goodness we did a Yelp search, otherwise we never would have seen it! It's small and in a random strip mall...but don't judge a book by its cover. The decor is very neat and the food is incredible! The chips are always warm and delicious, and La Mestiza has some really unique entree options when compared to Mexican places I am used to. However, the organization of the menu is a little confusing, and the service is hit or miss. Easy things to overlook-- I would definitely recommend La Mestiza!",1.0
"This has been long over due. The staff is friendly, professional and funny (especially Brandon Gray). While some of the pieces were WAAAAAAAY out of my price range, Brandon was extremely helpful and SUPER DUPER PATIENT in helping me chose pieces that were more in my budget and helping me build my wish list! I probably spent an hour and a half frolicking around the store in pure bliss, while I was there they let me try on their outrageously lux items i.e. feather\/leather coat and SOILD GOLD Rolex X CH (SUPER HEAVY) watch. 

ADVICE:
1. You are not allowed to take pictures in the store. Some girl was trying to take a selfie with a CH hoodie on and the security guard literally yelled out, ""NO PICTURES!""

I dont know what else to say about it other than it beats out the other tea lattes here in Vegas. The tea doesnt taste even one second over-brewed. Its perfectly time to where theres not a hint of bitterness in any of the teas. The crepes too are delicious but the star is truly the tea.

The interior is simple but still nice. Theres seating inside and out. Looks clean from what i can see and no problems with the bathrooms. Brew tea bar staff are friendly and attentive. They are well trained for the most part.

I visited this mid-century circular masterpiece of a flipped dungeon of a mini castle yesterday.  I booked for a free group tour (2PM) via davidwrighthouse.org, which they appreciate to be done to prevent too many people at one time attempting to fit inside the house.  Since they are very popular, I was booked 2 months in advance.  (I certainly hope this month's not the final month of the tour, due to a dispute with fussy (Arizona) neighbors!)  The rule is this:  when you arrive for your appt, you must park on the southernmost section at the parking lot of Camelback Church of Christ 5225 E. Camelback Rd next door and enter the House property through a gray gate with a sign on it and continue a long path towards the Small House, where a docent meets the tour group before heading towards the Main House.  Do not park on Rubicon Rd or nearby residential street for this purpose.  The back gate on Rubicon is for deliveries only; the docent or volunteer will not open the gate for you and would direct you to go to that church.  As I first entered the property, I felt like I was entering a commune or  UFO base (because of the dusty weaving driveway\/walkway) ;)
The 10-acre Arcadia gated property sits privately at the base of Camelback Mountains south of Camelback Road and was designed \/ built in 1952 by the master architect Frank Lloyd Wright, where it used to be all citrus grove and a bald mountain.  Currently, you cannot even see the the property off of Camelback Rd.  The House was purchased by a private buyer for 2 million dollars in 2012 to save it from demolition.  The Conservancy eventually restored it and are still maintaining the entire property- even the remaining Wright Family still occupies it (you can see their clothes in the bedroom closets ;) ).  This type of circular mid-century house is known for having had no garage, extra fireplaces, few bathrooms, and little storage space, as well as poppy colorful decors in geometric patterns.  The museum conducts free tours, educational programs, and welcome various events.
The docent, Phil Booker, an older gentleman who appeared fond of the House, gave an approximate 2-hour tour beginning inside the Small House and next heading towards the inside of the Main House and next outside around the House, including atop the roof.  It's as if he's selling the house and we were potential buyers.  He even asked each of us where we were from ;)  You are required to wear provided scrub-like shoe covers or your own clean socks to walk around inside the Main House (not Small House) to protect the original flooring and hand-made woven throw rugs.  Unlike other museums, you can TOUCH (gasp), so the atmosphere felt very relaxed and like visiting a family.  You don't have to stay very close with the group, especially if you walked away a bit to take specific photographs.  You can photograph\/videotape anywhere on the property.  At the end, you can fill out a card offering to support or volunteer the Wright House.  While the tour was almost flawless, I highly suggest to the staff to save visitors the time by placing a sign\/note at the church gate letting them know to first enter the Small House at the start of the tour- they, including myself, entered the Main House only to be told to go over to the Small House.  There were also boxes inside the Small House blocking the fireplace which made it hard to photograph without the unsightly box in the way.  Just keep the Small and Main Houses cleaner and more free of clutter; otherwise, the (working) bathrooms were clean ;)

"My first visit to this restaurant was pretty impressive! Definitely among the best AYCE sushi locations in the Scarborough area especially based on the price. 

I ordered many of the appetizers. The tempura items I tried were great - especially the tempura shrimp. Amazing, light and crispy! Loved it. The tempura crab was unique and I enjoyed a few pieces. Haven't seen that at other places before! The only downfall - the deep fried scallops. They looked like they were from a box of frozen, processed foods. The texture was not very favourable at all - like sticky mush inside. Not a big deal, only had two, just won't order those again next time! Wouldn't recommend that specific appetizer for ""scallop connoisseurs""!

The sushi rolls we ordered were great. They were neat, texture was right, taste and variety was very excellent! Big points for that. Definitely a lot of different rolls to choose from, something for everyone. I believe that even people trying for the first time will find something they're comfortable with trying!

One thing that really stood out to me is that many of the other guests that were there were repeat customers or even regulars at this place. I overheard from other guests' convo with the waitresses and other guests' convo among each other, this is a place where people feel welcomed and treated well. 

The waitresses were friendly and very personable. Easy to chat with and not intimidating when asking questions. We were checked on just enough to feel taken care of, not excessively. Lots of smiles and prompt service.

Large place and  inviting pub feel. Beer selection is over the top --probably 100 on tap.  I like Belgium beer and put together a flight of 4 that I hadn't had before. Impressive selection. Food was good quality but finished product was okay. Fish and chips was 25 and good.  Not 25 good but it's Vegas. Would return and if I got food I  would try something,1.0
"What an amazing hotel! Very friendly staff was always available to assist me with any matter.

"Great service, friendly staff.  First time for my aunt and uncle trying Filipino food, and they were impressed.   We had the popular sizzling pork sisig, and honestly, I was a bit disappointed because it was too oily and too salty.  Presentation was nice though.   The best dish was pansit guisado--amazing flavors, they even separated the shrimps because my uncle is allergic to them.  The chicken adobo was pretty good with potatoes.   The Java rice lived up to its good reputation.   The sago't gulaman boba drink was refreshing and went well with the meal.  Make sure to write a review to get your free flan!   I'd definitely come back and try different dishes.",1.0
Stopped by to grab a drink with my fiancé. The bartender helped us right away and was nice. Was a little empty for a Saturday afternoon. We tried to sit outside but the chairs were a little unorganized so we didn't know what chairs went with what tables. So we just stood up and enjoyed the drink. They had connect 4 games and jenga which I thought was pretty cool.,1.0

Attended a birthday dinner at Oscar's. A few of the items ordered were: 
-The Italian Market appetizer, was ok, I wouldn't order again. 
-Sister and I ordered the Spicy Flame Charred Spilotro Steak, very flavorful, had a nice kick to it. The steak came w\/a side of smashed potatoes which were just ok. 
-Hubby ordered the Prime Rib which was huge and amazingly good! 
-Brother in law ordered the Pork Chop which came with 2 pieces topped w\/ mushrooms. Very big portion and yummy. 
-Since each side is like $8-10 we ordered the 'Any Three Sides' for $20 and shared; Steamed Asparagus, Brussels Sprouts with caramelized onions & bacon and Shmuley's Extraordinary Mac & Cheese. All were super delicious! Fave was the Mac & Cheese, omg in love.

All and all this place was great. Scott our server was very nice and attentive. At the end of our dinner he gave us a quick tour of the restaurant and their hidden back room. Very nice place, we will be sure to come back in the future.",1.0

"1st time here yesterday and though there were no one else in the restaurant, the food and service was above par. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and there's a good amount of selection on the menu. I ordered the ""house"" dog aka ""the dirt dog"" which consisted of a beef dog wrapped in bacon (all their dogs are which is awesome!) topped with grilled onions and peppers cooked in thousand island sauce, letchu, mayo, mustard, and bacon bits! As far as the bun, you have a choice of 3, I chose the Portuguese which is a ""sweeter"" bun and the bun is laced with a green chile spread. Overall, it was a delicious dog! Probably one of the best I've had in a while. My friend ordered the ""red"" dog which was spicier -- and for those who aren't too used to spice, it definitely has a kick! My lips were burning a bit after tasting hers! Dirt dog is definitely a good spot to grab a quick and satisfying bite, so glad they brought one over from LA to Las Vegas. Also, shoutout to one of the chef's Cameron! Since business was a little slow when I went, he hooked it up with some free samples that weren't on the menu! From onion rings, to jalapeño poppers, and his own secret sauce!",1.0
These guys are amazing.  I just called in to get a part for my old Polaris Jet ski.  They are not associated with Polaris so they did not have my part.  However their service manager Jesse spent 20 minutes of his time searching online to find me the exact part I needed.  He spent his time and effort to help even though he wasn't making a dollar off of it.  Incredibly rare and amazing service.

"Deborah was amazing! I regularly get Brazilians and wanted to try sugaring. She is professional and so easy to talk too during such a personal thing being done....also she is FAST. For those of you who have gotten Brazilians before you know this is key. If you have never gotten a Brazilian I highly recommend seeing Deborah for one. My mom got a bikini sugaring from her and also gave a big thumbs up! Way less painful then traditional waxing. Also her pricing is spot on too... $80 for sugaring is not bad. And let me tell you if you think that's expensive go and get a $40 wax somewhere else and see how your who-ha feels afterwards...

"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here. Yesterday I took a much needed lunch break to enjoy some sushi. I decided on the spicy tuna roll and the lunch bento box which made me more than full. If you're trying to come here during the 11-3 lunch hour and don't want sushi I say get the lunch box\/ lunch ramen choices for $11, drink included! More bang for your buck. If, in fact, you have chosen to take a later lunch or head over for happy hour I believe they have sushi 20% off from 3-6, which is great. The sushi is always fresh and the waiters are super nice. I even heard that there's a spot upstairs for karaoke.

If you are feeling adventurous, they also offer a scorpion shot where you can shoot a baby scorpion in some tequila - or whatever liquor you choose. When in Vegas....you have to try something like this once...plus it makes a great photo opportunity. The scorpion will set you back about $9, on top of the shot - so not a cheap adventure, but how often do you have the opportunity to eat a scorpion?",1.0

The food came out fairly quickly and was great, but could have been a little hotter. The salmon entree was small but the flavors make up for it. The capellini bianco is an angel hair pasta dish with shrimp and lump crab, light but creamy and delicious!

Service was great but a little slow. I guess many others like to take their time while dining but we wanted to eat and see other things.

 I met some friends up there we linked up. 

Once I started i just wanted to learn the basics and get a flow for everything. The staff and my friends really helped a lot. Especially a guy there named josh  he helped me out a lot to help get a feel for things. Everybody was very helpful. 

They started me on the bunny hill for the first run down just to get me down the hill, then then I went straight to the second biggest mountain there. 

Josh and my friends felt like the best way for me to learn was to get up and do it, and they were right. 

I went down the the hill for two runs, I fell a bunch of times but I never gave up, and had fun doing it and I was totally out of breath lol. Be ready for a full body workout.

"Finally, another brunch option! 

My boyfriend and I have honestly been underwhelmed with the brunch options in Charlotte. I had company in town the other weekend and decided to give Vivace a try. I am glad we did. 

They have a lovely patio with a view of the city, which is perfect for brunch. We made reservations, so we were seated right away. 

I loved that they had the Vivace Way- an appetizer, entree, and unlimited mimosas or bloody marys for $25! It is a great deal, and they allow you to switch back and forth between the bloody mary and the mimosa. I figured they would be small portions due to the price, but we all left stuffed! We all shared a little bit of everything, and we were all impressed with our dishes. 

Highlights for me were the meatballs, the pork belly hash, and the quiche. Everything was yummy though and I felt as though I got my money's worth. 

I will say this seems to be a trend for Vivace reviews, but I would've given this place 5 stars if we had had better service. I hope they start to take the reviews seriously and improve upon this. Our service was mediocre, and if it was better this would've enhanced the experience.",1.0

"Ramen is taking a while to catch on around where I live, so I drive for 30 minutes to get it at Kenzo. And I'll tell you this; it's well worth the drive. The broth is flavorful, the noodles are just the right chewiness and the sides are made just right. 

The last time I trekked out to Mississauga, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen and a side of gyoza. The smokiness of the pork topping was wonderful against the savory broth and the sweetness of the pork & onion dumplings was a satisfying contrast.

I envy those who can pop into Kenzo ramen shop whenever the weather gets cold, for me, it's a rare treat for when I can spare a few hours, but I look forward to it whenever the occasion presents itself.

They are very informative about their own products (which to a college student such as my self seem expensive) sometimes I feel like I can't get any true advise because they try to work in their products somehow (understandable they're just doing their job) I guess I want girl to girl advise instead of solicitors advice 

Whenever I get my Brazilian I do leave feeling fresh clean and smooth and I do recommend people try it however I do find I always have quite a few stragglers left behind which I'm not sure if I'm paying 50 dollars for them to get the stragglers to or pay to pluck them myself. Not sure if it's just my type of hair or I just haven't been able to experience other workers because I've only been with one girl ever since I've started (not gunna name names homie)

This place is great! My son just turned two and I wanted to take him to his first indoor playground experience. He loved it! This place was clean and spacious. It had an area for parents to relax and sit in massage chairs also had a designated eating area. The bathrooms were clean and loved that it had a diaper genie to prevent odors. All the gym equipment was well kept clean and safe. They even have a sort of runway track surrounding the play area and free weights for parents to get a little exercise time while kids play! All these little features were awesome and very much appreciated! I think $10 of play for 3 hours is totally worth it and will be great during the hot summer Vegas months..

We didn't eat there other than one app and some chips and salsa so I can't recommend much on the food yet. However we had their New Mexican Potstickers and they were pretty good. Chips were fresh and salsas were tasty.

The happy hour food at their bar tastes like absolute crap though, it was $3, me and my friends figured we'd grab some food after a power craps session, the Mac and cheese looked like macaroni with cheez whiz, and the fish tacos were a piece of fried fish with an cheap taco shell around it.

Legit.  Slight sketchy predicament, i.e. you are going inside of some stranger's apartment, but once you step inside his workshop, a.k.a. spare bedroom, you know that he knows what he's doing.

I had brought 2 vintage watches for him to look at, a Longines and a Rolex.  The Longines stopped ticking, even after a battery replacement from a Chinese mall kiosk...never again.  As soon as Shane looked at it, he determined that the watch was possibly damaged by the cheap battery replacement.  In addition, simply taking it for a battery replacement also caused a part to go missing from the watch, so that the backing is unable to close.

Shane was able to get it ticking again, but since the watch is from the '70s, he was unable to find a replacement part to keep the backing in place.  The repair itself was only $10.  I believe Shane's an old school kinda guy who does cash only.

The presentation was the eye-candy that was just as pleasantly tasteful as the food itself.  The ambiance was classy yet casual.   Great staff that explained each meal and wine description.  And Ohhhh, the dessert!  Speechless with the variety of sweet and semi-sweet pastries that was perfectly combined on a slate slab.  I have traveled and dined at very fine restaurants,  Decca77 dining experience should be a ""bucket-list"" item for those who can appreciate genuine find dining.",1.0

"Came here for some late night grilled meats. This is a more authentic Korean BBQ restaurant that offers four different types of meats to grill - pork belly, beef brisket, pork neck, and bulgogi. While there is the option to order one or two, for a few dollars more you can get all four. Each meat is flavoured differently, because of this the bulgogi is brought in last to grill due to its sweetness. The pork belly is actually quite fatty with little meat but it's so good when grilled crispy and wrapped in lettuce. 

Each order comes with rice, lettuce, salad, soybean paste stew, and an assortment of side dishes. These are refillable. Combined with the all you can eat meat it makes for a nonstop eating experience. 

Servers here are friendly, especially the owner. He will come and sit and drink with you if you invite him, but service is a bit slow. While I love that they have private booths for dining, it makes it hard to get the attention of the servers. Even with the equipped call bells, servers don't respond to them. Aside from that, this place is excellent for Kbbq. Expect to come out smelling like grilled meats!",1.0

"I will start by saying I was disappointed by the misleading ""loaded"" pierogi name. I was under the impression that the ingredients were stuffed into the pierogi themselves however they are simply places on top of them. Regardless, the food was delicious. I ordered the philly cheese steak and was happy with it. Didn't have a very ""American"" taste to it which I was disappointed by. The meat seemed to have been marinated in Thai spices it seems.

The atmosphere is simple with New Orleans written all over it. It's a small place so if you have a big group get there early. The staff is always friendly and the prices are reasonable for the food. 

Speaking of food, let's talk about the good stuff. My wife always gets the fried chicken and it's delicious. Perfectly crunchy and flavorful.  The mac n cheese is her go to side.  I always get the seafood jambalaya. It's one of the greatest meals I've ever had. It's always consistently great!  Last night was no different. The jambalaya is filled with chicken and sausage, but when you order the seafood jambalaya it's filled with even more goodness. The plate is surrounded by beautiful mussels, a few huge shrimp, and what seems like a pound of crawfish. Just check out the picture!  This also comes with a side and I get....extra jambalaya!! 

This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants and we've been to a bunch of places from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and other tv shows.

They had renovated the interior since 2015 and it looks even better.  We started with a drink at the bar.  The bartender was friendly and helpful.  After making an excellent Manhattan he then spent quite a bit of time helping a customer from the day before identify the liquor he drank with a previous dinner.  I was impressed by the bartender's patience and professionalism (don't know why the customer didn't take a photo of the liquor bottle at the time he drank it.)

We splurge on the tasting menu and enjoy a leisurely meal.  As others have written, the portions are not small so you need to pace yourself.  This year my husband had the duck and it was delicious.  I had the filet mignon - yum!

"Our first time dining here, my husband and I didn't really know what to expect. But we learned that you order at the counter, pick a table and a server brings out your food when it's ready. We went with the Soup Du Jour which was a butternut squash soup at the time, a Blue Cheese & Pear Salad and a Cranberry Turkey sandwich. The cafe itself is quite dark and mostly the tables are lit. The atmosphere (and also the food) reminded me of an upscale Panera Bread. 

The food was simple, yet well put together. It was what you would expect from a cafe, but a hair fancier than your average cafe. The soup was rich, creamy and even included a garlic toast. The Blue Cheese & Pear Salad was good, but very sweet. Also, they were generous with the blue cheese, which got to be too strong at times. The sandwich tasted fresh and the bread was a bit crunchy on the outside, adding a nice contrast in textures. You really can't go wrong with the combo of turkey and cranberry.

Overall, this may be our stop to grab a bite any time we are in Ross Park Mall. Good, fresh food. Nice experience.",1.0
"I had ""to go""food - I want to come back when they install the beer ;) I ordered Cocido which was pretty flavorful I'm sure because it had bones in the meat! The Cubano was great! The mofongo with fried cheese and salami -- was interesting, you get a heaping portion of mashed plantains with onions which I've never had before, without the onions it would have been bland. I had to salt and pepper the crap out of them - maybe I should have added hot sauce?  I want to go back to try and see how the service is, and also to try more dishes! So far so good!",1.0
"Stepping into this restaurant is like stepping back in time.  Nothing has changed since the 1990s.  Even the prices are still the same (or at least very close).  Heck even the take-out menu is literally exactly the same, recognizable by the fact that the printed phone number predates Toronto's 10-digit dialing.

As for the food, I honestly have no complaints.  It's not gourmet level food, but it's well worth the price and bottom line is it tastes good.  Exactly what you'd expect from a small family run business like this.  The Day Specials at $3.99 are the best deal.  I particularly like the BBQ Pork Fried Rice.

So if you're in the mood for some good cheap Chinese food, I highly recommend this place.",1.0

All the entrées come with unlimited salad bar and bread. The salad bar is quite small, but it's all incredibly fresh. As for the main course, we had Le Golden Square Mile and Les Éclusiers. Bot were good, but LGSM was really good. It had the most delicious goat cheese I think I've ever had. The raviolis were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Les Éclusiers did not suck either, with a well-rounded heat to it. The shrimp were a good size, and well cooked. The flavor and freshness were fine.

"Friends and I visited East Thirty-Six for Winterlicious last night - and were glad we did! From the very beginning, we were politely escorted to our reserved table. Our server arrived promptly and kindly explained a few details about the Winterlicious menu. We ordered a bottle of their house wine ($38) and proceeded with our selections. I had the Chicken Liver and Fois Gras Parfait to start - it was absolutely delicious! The pate was creamy and rich, and paired well with the marrow buttered croustini that came with it. My one friend commented that it was the best fois gras she had ever tasted. My second course was the 72-hour Shortrib. This dish had no faults - it was a wonderful combination of flavours with the rich, slightly smokey meat, the creamy semolina, and a bit of heat from the horseradish. To me, it was perfection on a plate. The main course was served to us by Julien, one of the co-owners of the restaurant, who made us feel incredibly welcome. It was a very personal touch that made us feel like regulars - though we were first time visitors. Dessert for me was lemon curd with candied macadamia nuts and shortbread, a great combination of tart, nutty and sweet that was a delicious ending to the meal. Before leaving, we were offered four 'digestif' shots on the house - what better way to top off the meal? Overall, wonderful food, spectacular service, and a welcoming ambiance. The perfect spot for a night out with friends or a significant other in TO.",1.0

First time here. Glad we drove 20 minutes to try it out. The chicken is not the best we've had but it was definitely 4 star worthy. Staff was very friendly. I had the pulled chicken sandwich and it was delicious! My husband had the 1\/4 chicken dark. A little disappointed that they do not have sour cream for the fried plantains but otherwise everything was great. He also had the blackberry smoothie and loved it. The only negative thing I can say is that it took several minutes after being seated for someone to come over and greet us and take our drink orders. Other than that the wait staff was very attentive and the food came out pretty quickly. We will definitely be back.,1.0

I ordered the Spaghetti e Bufala (tomato sugo, mozzarella di bufala, basil, padano). This was a simple yet effective tomato-sauce-based pasta dish.

When I moved here, I thought about opening up a franchise here. Luckily this opened up right on the rail. It is affordable and delicious! Haven't had the signature pizzas yet. I have always done build your own. They have a large variety of toppings and sauces that all flow well together. System is kind of like Qdoba, Chipotle, or Subway where you tell them what you want as you go down the line. Pizza cooks fast in about 3 minutes. I seriously thought about moving to the apartment attached to Blaze so that I could eat this everyday.",1.0
"We couldn't be happier with how beautiful our pool looks after having it drained and cleaned by Arizona Pool Blasters. My husband and I recently purchased our home without realizing how bad the calcium buildup was on our pool tile. We were even told that it was one of the worst cases the company had seen, so we were worried that we were going to have to bite the bullet and spend a lot of money replacing the tile. Luckily, Jarin's crew was able to completely remove the buildup and restore the tile to its original condition. I'm truly amazed with their work!

Additionally, the company provides a superior level of customer service. They had some equipment issues on the day they arrived to drop the pump to drain our pool and had to come back the next day, pushing our completion date back one day. They were very apologetic and ensured us that everything would be taken care of as quickly as possible. However, when the guy arrived the next day to drop the pump, he was unable to locate our sewer clean out. We were told that they typically locate the clean out during the estimate, but they forgot to look for ours so he couldn't drain our pool. 

My husband and I were panicking over this news. We had scheduled our cleaning a month in advance and were on a tight deadline to get our pool finished. I spoke with Jarin right away and, after reviewing our city's laws regarding pool drainage, we came up with an alternate plan. Not only did Jarin guarantee that our pool would be completed the next day, he personally came out to our house at 8pm that night to drop the pump and drain our pool. His crew arrived first thing the next morning to clean our pool and started refilling it by 10am. THAT is customer service!

We had some hiccups, but the way in which this company remedied them was very impressive. We've received many compliments on our pool and we owe it all to Arizona Pool Blasters. We will definitely continue using them, and plan to refer them to all of our friends. Thank you, Jarin!",1.0

What more could you possibly ask for?",1.0
"I enjoyed the Spicy Sausage so much, I went to this place twice in one day. I just had to do it again! There was so much food to choose from, I wanted to taste it all.

When I first went in, I didn't think I was going to appreciate the food. It didn't look like I place I would eat at. The atmosphere was a bit uninviting. The place is really small and was quite packed, which was expected, being that it was lunch time.

I didn't have much time to decide what to eat because a older guy was behind me huffing and puffing because of the wait. I quickly decided on the Spicy Sausage Combo and a pizza puff. It took them about 12 minutes to prepare the food and pass it to me.

I took the food to go, so when I got home (a 10 minute drive) my food was still warm. I unwrapped my Sausage and bit into it. The peppers and grilled onions mixed with the Sausage took me by surprise. It was magnificently and pleasantly spicy and the flavor perfectly blended together to make a hell of a dog! It was damn near perfect!

The chili cheese fries were really good. They remind me of when I was a kid, eating Chili Cheese fries from Krystal's. They were a tad bit Floppy but I had to consider my drive home. But, even with the drive they were still delicious. I will get them again.

The pizza puff, on the other hand, were just decent. I've had better, in Chicago, that is, but never the less, it was refreshing to have a imitation pizza puff so close to home. I probably wouldn't order it again because it was the least favorite amongst the items on the menu. I appreciate that I had something to hold me over until my next trip to the actual Windy City.

My second visit back, I took my friend, a Chicago native. I had hyped her up about the food. I knew she wasn't going to be disappointed. It was around the closing time so the place had cleared out to comfort.

That time I had more time to study the menu being that there was no line. We ordered the Spicy Sausage, again, and the Double Dogs with regular fries that time. We decided to eat it there because there were a lot of open tables.

It took about 10-12 minutes for them to prepare the food. I'll say this, I don't like that they have full conversations over the food. A lot of people spit when they talk and its disturbing to think about the ""what ifs"".

Either way we got our food, said I prayer and dug in. The dogs were not as good as the sausage, but they were satisfactory. They went too quick, that I will mention.

The fries were better with chili and cheese on them. They were just fries, nothing special there.

The sausage was as good as it was before. We loved it.

In all, it was good. I've added this place to my ""I know what to get when I go back"" list.",1.0
"Really impressed by the staff here -- everyone was so nice, accommodating, and hospitable -- from the front desk, to the restaurant, and even the Starbucks barista. Had a great experience staying here.",1.0
"I love this place. I wrestled with a 4 or a 5, and settled on a 4 for two primary reasons. First, I don't come here as often as I otherwise would (perhaps a health blessing in disguise :) ) because it is so challenging to find parking. Second, I absolutely LOVE their breakfast but find it annoying that you can't get breakfast when they open. I believe they start serving breakfast at 8am... which is super not convenient on a weekday when I have to go to work. Other than that, the vibe and decor is great and the staff is super friendly. Coffee and espresso drinks are good, beers on tap are good, and the food is quite wonderful! I do wish they had a website (I would've come here sooner in life if they did! Facebook doesn't count in my book) but not the biggest of deals. Can't complain too much about a one-stop shop for coffee; good, cooked food; and beer! And the vault door is neat :)",1.0

"From the moment I showed up, there were warm vibes all around.  The front office staff was super friendly and easy to work with.  They try to go above and beyond to meet your needs with scheduling. One time we had an emergency appointment for my 1 year old, who at that time knocked out his front tooth.  It took us less then a day to get in to see them when we got back into town.  It took them less than 45min to call me back when I originally called about the issue when we were out of town.   The  on call dr walked me through everything over the phone so I had some peace of mind and could continue our vacation.  

The office is very clean and modern and has great distractions for the kids.  The dentists have been super friendly, patient and very willing to explain all that they need to do, see and except.  My kids are not afraid of the dentist and for that I am thankful! I am very happy with this office and will gladly drive the extra miles to go there!",1.0
"Had lunch here today with my husband, daughter and her friend. I ordered the paella, the girls ordered lobster ravioli, and my husband got the fillet and shrimp special. From the time we walked in until we left, we were treated like royalty. We never had to lift the sangria pitcher to refill our glasses, it was done for us. The portions were more than generous for the price, the food was phenomenal, and the service over the top. Can't wait to go back!",1.0

I also had a spiked milkshake (highly recommended) I had the CAMPFIRE SMORES $13 again worth it! It had smirnoff marshmallow vodka (with extra shot), chocolate, marshmallow, graham cracker crumble.  All this had me ready to get wild for the night!! I will definitely go back! GO EATS PEEPS!! O P.S. check-in on yelp and you get a free glass of beer!",1.0
"Had a flat tire\/puncture from a nail in my car on Sunday and called these guys to ask for help and they were spectacular! Actually drove the car out to their garage and there was no wait whatsoever, they assessed it immediately, and then patched the hole in the tire right on the spot. Then they even offered to put my spare tire on and switch the patched one into the spare tire reserve. Best of all, it was only $15. Amazing! The man could not have been any more kind, cheerful, and helpful!",1.0

"I love coming to Echo & Rig for several reasons.  
1) It's so conveniently located by my office; it has become my second conference room.  (In case you don't know, it's located at Tivoli Village.)
2) Valet is right there! It takes me less than a minute to walk from the valet to the entrance of the restaurant, in three-inch heels! 
3) No one ever says no to Echo & Rig whenever I suggest this place, and I usually deal with picky\/snobby eaters. 
4) Service is always phenomenal.  They always make it a point to ask whether you're a first-timer or not.  They like to welcome you back and warmly greet new guests and explain the culture of the restaurant (this place is chef-owned, by the way).  For me, that's a plus because it gives me a couple minutes to breathe and watch someone else entertain my clients for a few minutes. 
5) The food is always exceptional.  My go-to is the duck because it is absolutely delicious, but the rib-eye cap is also heavenly.  If you do get the rib-eye cap, get it medium even though you like your steak medium rare like myself.  Due to the marbling of the cut, medium rare will make it too chewy.  I was a skeptic myself when the server suggested I have it cooked medium, and I made it a point to him that I will return it back to the kitchen if it's not good.  Needless to say, I didn't return it; it was perfection.  Yes, the portobello mushroom is their #1 seller, and yes, they are delicious.  Crab cakes are just ok even though it's 95% crab meat.  Caesars salad is well done if you really need a salad.  Their cauliflower is good and most people like it, but I like cauliflower without it being deep-fried, so I am biased.  
6) Extensive wine list and all their drinks are amazing and well done; the drinks keep getting better as you keep ordering...

"No one does Mexican food better in Madison than Taqueria Guadalajara. The best part is - every time I go, I try something new. So, I cannot provide a quality review on one single menu item, but I can say they do it right. There's usually some form of soccer\/futbol playing on the televisions, and the homemade chips and salsa are completely satisfying. 

The weekend specials are worth the dedicated trip - I had menudo for the first time here and was delighted. While I'm not one to order tripe (beef stomach) specifically - it's use in this soup was spot on.

I came here for lunch really craving a shawarma and some garlic sauce. I usually just go to Boustan for that but decided to give this place a go. The meat was great, the sauce was creamy, and the overall wrap exceeded my expectations. It tasted fresh and savory. 

This place is located in the Galeries du Parc but they made an effort to have their own seating area so it looks much nicer than the rest. 

They also serve fresh juice and desserts.

The potatoes were cut a bit too big for my taste, but they were still very good. Not my favourites though.

"Saw this little gem in the paper, glad we did.  Wonderful venue for the west side.  In the back of a strip mall at 59th Ave and Union Hills you would not expect gourmet food.  We started with the fried calamari which was soft, with a crunchy outside served with pickled peppers that made the dish come together.  I had the skirt steak and my hubby had the Pecan Chicken.  This was the first time in a long time that I wished I had ordered the chicken over the steak.  The steak was cooked perfectly for me with a layer of chimichurri underneath.  The sautéed vegetables were EXCELLENT!!!  Back to the chicken, when they say ""pecan smoked"" they were not kidding.  The smoke flavor was a pleasant surprise.  It was juicy, and cooked just right.  The sweet potato orzo was a good match.  My husband said, ""this was the best chicken I have ever had"".  Three weeks old, they are still working out some bugs, but handle it so well you don't mind.  I would like something other than fries with the steak, but my husband loved them.  (I keep mentioning him because he is a tough customer).  We will be back, more to try- the halibut, Caesar wedge, tortilla soup and dessert.  Natalie was exceptional.",1.0

"Loved!!! Lovely restaurant, small space but cozy and well decorated. 

We tried all three broths.  The ginger chicken was my favorite.   Spicy miso had a kick to it and the kombu was the least flavorful.  They don't have a ton of flavor until you start cooking up your veggies and meats.  

I ordered the Ohio wagyu and found that the broth became very rich and delicious after cooking about 1\/4 of my meat. 

Other reviewers indicated that you don't get much food but we found that it was more than enough food and lots of fun.

"We were in this area on Sunday and decided to give this place a try. Fairly easy to locate, we were surprised to discover that we had the place to ourselves (to be fair, when we arrived, another couple were on their way out, but the whole time we were there, the only other person who came in was a staff member for a shift change).
Anyways, first impressions were good....barn wood bar, warm earth tone colour on the wall, comfortable inviting chairs....
Our waitress was at our table within a minute of being seated, with menus in hand. She took our drink order and off she went. I opted for a Diet Coke, my dining companion opted for coffee (Mexican our waitress advised us). The presentation of the coffee was fantastic...the full mug came on its own tray with a small porcelain container concealing cubed sugar, and also had a small container of cream. Who does that type of presentation anymore? My Diet Coke was served in a mason jar.
We both opted for Halibut and chips.
Our food arrived about 10 minutes later...a fairly large piece of halibut, generous amount of fries, coleslaw and tartar sauce.
The halibut was cooked perfectly. Only small complaint was that I found the batter to be a bit salty, while my dining companion said he couldn't taste any at all. Fries were a bit overcooked, but I somehow managed to eat them all. Coleslaw was standard fare.
Female staff member who replaced our waitress (who left mid shift) was as equally friendly and efficient.
Would I go back? If in the area...most definitely....its just that it's a good 30-40 minute drive from where I live. Damn.
Lunch as described above, with coffee and Diet Coke, tax and tip in, came to $35. Reasonably priced for Halibut.",1.0

I was in town visiting from Southern CA and we decided to try this place and thought the food was soooo good! I want them to open one in LA! My husband and I went for dinner and ordered a few different things to try - all were hot and tasted so good.  One of my favorites was the Curry Shrimp Appetizer, I could have literally drank a cup of this sauce.  The sushi rolls were great along with their variety of unique cocktails.  We also had the Crispy Cheesecake Wontons for dessert and they were so tasty and something we had never had before. 

We were surprised to find out that this restaurant recently had its grand opening! We didn't see signs of that at all.  Our waiter was very attentive to us, food came out quickly and was warm, and over all it was a great experience.  

We actually went back for a second time for lunch while we were in Charlotte, this time my husband had the Pad Thai and I got the Hanoi Noodles.

p.s. The ""spicy miso"" ramen gets it's spicy from the scoop of meat that is added to the bowl.  The texture reminds me of a sausage.  I had a few really hot bites and if I order it again, I might get it on the side to control the level of heat.  The sauce is mixed in with the meat so once you stir it or let it sit, it gets in the broth & you've committed to that level of heat.  Tasty but I had two moments where it got me good!",1.0

Poke here is just like what we can get in Hawaii which I really appreciate since the new poke craze is all about ""making your own bowl""

Let's paint the picture: it's a Friday night and I don't feel like cooking since  I'd rather play with my super cute daughter... so, I go to their website, order WAY too much sushi, sashimi and of course miso soup. Then, I get a big cheesy smile on my face when I see how cheap my total order is. I receive an email letting me know my order is ready and my husband will stop by on his way home and pick up our dinner. Everything comes packaged neatly (nothing like how take-out usually looks) and of course the food is yummy and I don't have to wash dishes at the end!!",1.0
"My friends in the East Coast always rave about how awesome this place is, and now I can too! For starters, Shake Shack is its own unique burger joint. Despite the constant comparisons to In-N-Out, I can say after trying it today that they are nothing alike. So let's put an end to this East Coast\/West Coast rivalry nonsense. :)

Okay, back to the burgers. Whenever I order a burger, I usually look for an option with sautéed mushrooms if one is available. I saw they had a ""Shroom patty"" and just assumed I could order my Shackburger with mushrooms. The cashier, however, informed me that the mushrooms only came in the form of the ""Shroom patty"". Um, okay. I'll pass on the mushrooms.

Despite the initial confusion, I ended up really enjoying my burger. Subbing regular burger buns for soft, buttered potato buns is just genius! The meat patty was juicy, flavorful, and perfectly topped with melted cheese, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, and pickles. I really liked the pickles because they aren't the precut, dill chips most burger joints use. They are actual, freshly cut dill pickles! The fries are good as well, especially if you're a fan of the crinkle-cut.

I will, however, attest to the overly high prices. You can easily find yourself spending about $20 on two burgers and fries here. Hubby also commented on the rather small size of the burgers. He isn't a proponent of large portions either. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I'm in the Summerlin area, I will definitely make a Shake Shack stop.

P.S. Ask for a side of ShackSauce for your fries. You won't regret it!",1.0

We were in search of a place to dine outside on this perfect summer Friday evening. The sign said seat yourself and on 1st pass the only tables available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverages. This wasn't on this gals preferred list. We attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min was an even I don't think so.... Back at  Bar Louie we went and scored a recently vacated table. 
Maria our awesome waitress greeted us kindly but have us some bad news... They were training new kitchen staff and it was taking a bit longer than usual for orders to come out.. But she assured us once they did they were as yummy and up to Bar Louie standards people have come to expect. 
Okay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance. 
We ordered drinks and the food came out quicker than expected. 
I ordered the  Chop Chop salad and added shrimp to mine... Was done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast was a welcome addition. 
My husband  opted for the savory Mac n cheese pork sandwich....my taste bite was scrumptious and lived up to maria's hype. 
Great food... Superb service... Great to see a chat in restaurant can still offer patrons something to come back for!",1.0
"If I could give 6 stars I would. What an absolutely WONDERFUL experience!

My girlfriend and I have always agreed experiences are worth far more than possessions. For my birthday, she signed me up for a 3-hour session at the Whiskey School here put on by George, the owner and founder of Las Vegas Distillery and the man who made America's first Desert Whiskey.

George taught us everything from the history of the drink, to how it's made, grain to bottle, to how to use his million dollar contraption pictured behind us - not to mention each intricacy of the science in between. We were involved the whole time and it was more-so a conversation, not a lecture, which makes for a strong learning experience.

In the middle of the session, he even bought us lunch! Another one of the employees there (I think Sid? Missed his name) joined us as we sat down at the picnic tables inside. Two pizzas were ordered and we shared a six-pack as we took a break from the whiskey talk and got to know each other more personally.

We finished the day with a blind tasting where my newly gained knowledge resulted in one of 20 or so perfect scores George has ever seen. My girlfriend and I left with smiles ear to ear, two new bottles from George's first barrels, a new best friend and one unforgettable memory. What an incredible man and day well spent.

It's worth mentioning that we were the only people there that day for Whiskey School, so others may have different experiences based on class size, but we were utterly wowed by how great of a day we had. We cannot wait until the next time we are in Vegas so we can stop by the distillery and catch up with George.

Did you know, the whiskey that naturally evaporates from the barrel during the aging process is called Angel's Share? In Scotland and Kentucky, 2% of the barrel is consumed by the angels each year. In Las Vegas' dry climate, George copes with upwards of 11% loss each year. In turn, no whiskey can be aged in Las Vegas 10 years or you'd simply have nothing left. That 50 year old whiskey your friend gave you from Scotland? Unless it's air, your friend was lying. These are some of the few facts you'll learn and retain throughout the day.

Lastly, it stuck with us how George mentioned coming to America with his wife from Romania was life-changing and becoming an American citizen is the highest honor. Couldn't help but be happy hearing that! One of the other reviews on here mentioned when there are awesome people doing an awesome thing and you want them to be successful. That's exactly how I feel as well.

Cheers, George!",1.0
"While visiting Montreal with a couple friends, this was one of those places that I discovered was an absolute gem. I'm mostly vegetarian, however I could sense the trepidation my 
(carnivorous) friends had in going to a new city and a new restaurant, with a cuisine that -lets face it- can either be reeeally good, or reeeally bad. But let me tell you, everything was delicious! I had the quiche of the day with this great chickpea salad and some greens that has a bomb dressing. That might not sound very filling, but the portions were hearty. Everyone left the table happy, satisfied, and pleasantly surprised at how awesome vegetarian\/vegan food is. (I told them so)

The style is very boho, with quaint little details that make it even more unique of a space. One being, if your table has little drawers...open them. One of my friends just had to snoop around and she was delightfully surprised to find little love notes. Over a pitcher of their red sangria, it was a great topic of conversation, and a perfect start to our Montreal adventure.",1.0

"I was glad to see this bistro take over the spot once belonging to a bank.  This little plaza is located on a prime spot along Route 130 and it certainly would be a shame  to see a vacant store front.  Having said this, I finally had a chance to stop in on a Saturday.

I had no idea they offered so many different food options.  I figured they had coffee, teas and light bakery and snacking items but I found out that  they also have a great breakfast menu that is served daily up until 10:30AM

During the later part of the day you can order burgers, footlong hotdogs, various sandwiches, wraps and at least 8 different salads,  soups, and quesadillas. I am curious in trying the Salmon BLT with chipotle peach sauce.  By the way, everything ending in an ""s"" is converted into a ""z"" on their menu to go along with the bee theme.  Clever.
Oh, and yes, there are plenty of good coffee and dessert options to choose from.

They did a wonderful job converting this former bank into a fun and inviting bistro.

Although I didn't particularly care for the texture of the eel roll (probably because I'm not a big fan of eel..), it was my friend's favorite. We also had a perfectly cooked shrimp tempura roll, and a deliciously prepared dragon roll with avocado on top. Paired with a glass of Pinot Grigio, lunch was overall fantastic.

I'm not a huge fan of the standards, the burritos, enchiladas and such, they are a little bland and they don't taste like tex-mex that most people are used to eating.

"I love Denny's and have been so disappointed by our visits all over Vegas.  Plus a visit to the worst Denny's in the country on Ann and Simmons turned us off Denny's for a while.  One Saturday my Mom and kids finally convinced me give a different location a try.  This location is a gem.  The hostess was sweet and attentive (she mentioned it was her first day - pretty awesome for her first day).  Our server (Francisco?) was FANTASTIC!  He was super busy but on top of everything.  Running around like crazy taking care of every detail.  I've never seen someone look so at ease with such hard work.  He really took the time to get orders right, refill drinks and even visit with my baby.  Food was fast and the best I've ever had at a Denny's.  Place was packed but so efficient that I rarely saw any parties waiting.  I noticed a manager on the floor helping run food, drinks and training the hostess.  All other Denny's could take a lesson in pride and customer service from this location.  Good job guys!  We will absolutely be back to see you!",1.0

I wish there were half stars because I would really give them a 3.5. Went here for dinner yesterday. We got the chorizo queso fundido dip for an app. It was really good. Our only complaint was it then took a good 40 min for our entree to come after that. A lot of people around us that came in well after us had received their entrees before us. Not sure what was going on because we didn't order intense entrees. My husband got the green curry vegetables and I ordered the fish tacos. Both were good.

"Experience:  I found this place on YELP, because it's super close to my Grandpa. 

Facility: It's located in a casino, which is located in a strip mall, tucked back off the main street. When you walk in, there's a bar\/smoking\/casino side and a restaurant side. This is nice so the smoke doesn't overpower the dinning room. It's a quiet, dark atmosphere in the dinning room. It has nice booths and some tables and chairs in the middle. They have a nice small salad bar in the back too. 

Service: They are a bit slow here sometimes, but depends on the waitress you get. Mostly they seem pretty friendly. I liked the waitress we had today. 

Food:  So far the food has been pretty good. The prices are middle ranged, but true have nice sized potions. 
This time I ordered off the daily special menu and got the clams linguini. 
It was good. Lots of clams, lots of garlic (maybe a tad bit much), and good sized portion. It came with 2 small pieces of very good garlic toast. 
My Grandpa got the prime rib. It was a big portion, and he loved it. I took a bite, and it was tender and cooked perfectly for me. The problem is he wanted med-well. It was more med to med-rare. 

Overall:  We will definitely be back. It's close and the food is pretty good.",1.0
"Where do I start..
The place has a very 1940s feel with a nice old fashion bar! The menu is massive - so if you have picky company it is a safe choice. The food takes a little while, but it is because they actually have a kitchen and not just a microwave. The waitress will read you a long list of specials that take like 5 minutes. This is not the place you go to if you are in a rush. This is the kid of place you go for a nice birthday\/valentines dinner. It almost seems like a fancy place, but the food is so cheap! It is hard to find a place that has a nice meal with a protein that is under 20!

"If you're going to Encore or leaving... you MUST swing by this place to grab some bomb cheap tacos!! It's literally one block away. Nothing fancy, just some delicious authentic tacos. You walk in, and there's signs directly telling you which line to place your orders for specific taco's or other items you wish on the menu. It's an open view kitchen where you could see all the love that is going into it while seeing and smelling the meats being stewed or grilled which is pretty cool. After you place your order, you bring it over to a separate cashier counter to pay... And that's where you may ask for a cup for free refills on whatever beverage you please for the Vegas hot weathers. They have some pretty unique Mexican fountain drink options such as mango juice, horchata, creamy orange drink, some sort of chrysanthemum or jasmine lemon ice tea, etc. 

THE FOOD -- the two absolute must is the lengua (beef tongue) and the adobada (spicy pork).
Lengua - for some of you who gets intimidated of eating something like tongue... Well, don't be. I'm not one who ever likes to eat tongue or those sort of things besides two exception.. Now 3 (Blue Ribbon, Tacos El Bronco, now hello Tacos El Gordo). It literally just looks like ordinary chunks of beef... And it totally blows my usual NYC's fave taco spot's lengua taco. It's not as mushy but yet it's still tender.
Adobada - the spicy pork was flavorful along with the fresh topping and verde sauce. It wasn't too spicy too which is a plus for me since I'm a baby when it comes to spice.

You might say there's something for everyone and you may be correct! I enjoy both the free video games and the usually not free gaming! The patio has a fun bowling game too. They frequently rotate their beer selection, have tap takeovers and happy hour M-F. You can get a 100 ounce tower of beer (Bud Light?) for $15 at happy hour.

Ask for the video game themed mixed drinks menu! It's fun. The food menu has quite a few interesting and surprising choices such as a buffalo burger I've yet to try and mac 'n cheese which was great! I've had a few special menu items such as beef stew on St. Pat's Day which was awesome!

"Deville Dinerbar's on my go-to list every time I visit Montréal, a diner-meets-cool, casual cocktail bar concept where the food is consistently good and the staff is quite friendly and welcoming. Like any good diner, Deville's menu is huge (français à l'avant, English in the back), offering a variety of burgers, sandwiches, salads, pasta dishes, and a variety of desserts and shakes (yes, boozy ones, too).

My go-to burger here is the Deville: two beef patties with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, pickle chips, and their signature sauce, all stacked onto a very fresh, lightly grilled brioche bun that holds up to all that wonderfulness to the very last bite. The burgers are a blend of aged beef brisket, chuck, and short rib, a great combination that's absolutely delicious! The blend is what makes this burger special, a much better 'steak burger' than the ones served up by places like The Palm. The burger is accompanied by matchstick fries, and I appreciate that they're served in a small metal bowl - matchstick fries tend to lose their heat quickly, but the metal bowl help keeps them hot longer.

"This is my favorite place for Thai food in Cleveland. It's an authentic Thai restaurant tucked away in a cozy side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Ohio City's main street of restaurants and breweries. I have tried almost everything on their menu, and I highly recommend the Pad Thai dish if you fancy the classic noodles, the Pad See Ew dish if you crave thicker and wider noodles with a more soy saucy taste, and also the Curry dishes if you want to add some spice into your life. Service is friendly and accommodating. If you haven't been here before, they tend to recommend you start off your spicy level at 1 out of 5. I think 3\/5 is the maximum I'm able to handle. As a tip, ask for extra spice on the side. They take reservations over the phone, which is helpful for busy dinner times if you have a large party and don't want to wait. They also do carry out and close at relatively late hours which is awesome! Free street parking is located along the side road of the restaurant, which is convenient. Overall, Banana Blossom is a great place for a dinner date, a family meal outing, or a satisfying foodie experience with a group of friends in an intimate setting. Highly recommend!",1.0
"Have been waiting for a INCREDIBLE pizza place in North Phoenix and finally one has arrived. Until now the best pizza you could get up here without spending a huge amount of money was pretty much Barros, which is very ""okay"" pizza. With Marco's in town I don't know how I'll ever go back to Borros. We have been in several times now. The service is incredible, the manager is TOP NOTCH, super cool guy who has been doing a great job. The cheesy bread tastes gourmet. The pizza is cooked to perfection and thank god it's not the paper thin New York style you find ALL OVER the places here in Phoenix (sorry but I like my pizza with some guts). 

Pizza itself is very reasonably priced and incredibly delicious. The ingredients are so fresh, they taste like they came out of the ground from the farm about an hour before your meal (maybe they did!?). The cheese is home made, the sauce, the dough, everything is home made and you can taste it. The atmosphere inside is very nice, clean, modern and plenty of TV's and entertainment without feeling cheesy, no pun intended.

I cannot recommend this place enough. It's a pizza place that feels like a true pizza place, not a sports bar or some kiddie zone. It's an adult, pizza lovers pizza place. Keep up the good work Marco's!!!",1.0
"LAYOP is truly a one of kind clothing store. High quality t-shirts, super soft and stylish, at a surprisingly pocket-friendly price point! There is something for everyone here. Super dope designs and eye-catching colors. Cool thing about the tees is that you can wear them casual or dressed up! Highly recommend to come check out storeand shop til you drop!",1.0

"How to describe my experience with Alchemy. It is a wonderful addition to brunch places in Markham. The food is very good! I had the eggs benedict with smoked salmon, my brother an omelette, and they accommodated my sister in law's dietary restrictions. All were yummy!!  But ... the size of the establishment poses a problem. Is it a coffee shop or a restaurant? It is certainly too small to be both. I had tried coming here three other times (even week days), but every table was taken mainly by coffee drinkers, and once even by a student who had covered a table of four with books and papers. This wouldn't be a problem in other brunch places that serve coffee, or coffee places that serve brunch; unfortunately Alchemy does not have the space. I live close by and can afford to drop by to see if they are busy, but would not drive more than 10 minutes to stand and wait for their food with other good brunch places around. Also, when they are busy the food can take a while to come out, which again does not help their cause. I think better management is needed.
In any case, if you can get past the space issues, it is a great place to have brunch at.",1.0
"3.5 stars.

Visited Byblos for the first time... and left a little disappointed. 
Was it the hype? Was it the 4.5 average star reviews on Yelp? Probably a bit of both.

I came by Byblos on Monday night (6:30 pm) to a surprisingly more empty restaurant than I imagined. Reservations to this place are hard to get, but it seemed like I could have easily walked in and gotten a table. 

What we ordered-

1) Lamb Ribs: These were delicious... but SMALL. Seriously, why did no one else on Yelp mention how small these were? Pictures can be very deceiving. At first, I was surprised lamb ribs were $14 at a high end restaurant, but it made sense when I saw them. The dish was 4 lamb ribs, each barely 4 inches long. Now again, these were delicious, the seasoning on them were very good, but it wasn't anything too special. Lamb ribs are naturally delicious. 4\/5

2) Roasted Beets: This was the stand out dish of Bylbos. It was amazing. It came accompanied with a side of bread that was seasoned similar to the lamb ribs. The bread tastes great with the cheese and olive oil. It's almost Italian-like, as it really reminded me of a burrata dish. Also, don't let the ""beets"" part scare you off. My girlfriend and I don't like beets, so we almost didn't order this, but the beets really were not the focus of the dish... the cheese and bread are. To comment on the beets itself, they were delicious, but they were even smaller than the lamb ribs. 5\/5. Order this. 

3) Turkey Manti Dumplings: My girlfriend really looked forward to this dish. When she had the first one, I could tell she was disappointed. I tried it next, and I could understand why. The flavour was good, but it was... very lacking. The dumplings don't have a lot of filling, it was mostly dough that tastes good because of the yoghurt sauce. Some dumplings didn't have any filling at all. We left this plate half eaten. Not sure why it was highly touted on Yelp. 2.5\/5.

4) Crispy Squid: It's good but c'mon... it's fried calamari. There's really nothing much else to say about it. Fried calamari is always good isn't it? But... is it traditional Mediterranean food? I dunno. Probably not. 3.5\/5.

5) Tartufata: Being Chinese, my parents would be pissed off if they found out I spent $30 on rice that didn't even have any meat in it hahaha. Anyways, this was a rice with mushrooms, chick peas and truffle. It was tasty because the aroma with the truffle was very good. We mainly used this to compliment the squid, dumpling sauce and cauliflower. Hard to rate... I'd say a 3.5\/5 but I would not recommend this. The value just isn't there, and their other rices seems more interesting in hindsight. 3.5\/5.

6) Seared Cauliflower: This sidedish was cauliflower seared with duck fat. I'm a little hesitant to give Byblos credit for this dish because you can take any vegetable and sear it with bacon fat, steak fat or duck fat and it'll taste good. I personally liked this dish because I'm into strong flavours, but I can see how others can see this dish as ""fatty"" or ""heavy"". Regardless, 4\/5.

7) Loukoumades (Dessert): This dessert was great! It is essentially a bunch of small fried timbits surrounding icecream, topped with edible flower petals and burnt honey. I don't even like desserts and I found this to be excellent. Strongly recommend this if you're going to get a dessert. 5\/5. 

I want to warn you about the service. It's really slow. I came on a relatively quiet Monday night and my server did not do very well. It took a long time to do anything like taking our order, bringing out our food and bringing us the bill. 

I like the fact that someone will describe to you the dish when it arrives, but it wasn't done as well as Lee's restaurant. The servers at Byblos just spew out memorized lines really fast, instead of actually educating you about the dish or how to eat it. Go to Lee's and you'll see how they do it much better at explaining their dishes. 

Would I come back? Maybe. There's a couple things left on the menu I want to try but would I rave about it to my friends and coworkers? No, there's better places to spend your money or to celebrate an occasion.",1.0
"My past readings have always been in person, so this was definitely a different experience for me. I was nervous but extremely excited because of the reviews. So i hope mine can also help someone to decide to just go for it! What can you lose? If not with Alexis, you will go with someone else anyway and it wont be as good, trust me! She is such a pleasant woman to speak to. As everyone has mentioned, she does not want to know any details. Just areas you would like her to tell you about. It's pretty amazing how accurate she is and she left me just pondering over her words, all I could say was ""yeah"" ""definitely"" ""makes sense"" and ""I agree"" like a total dummy! But I just couldn't comment much cause she got it all right. But overall the reading left me feeling peaceful and self assured, but also just realizing things in a way I didn't want to, but I know I do. So it is an eye openning experience. Don't cheat yourself from her gift and her truth cause she will tell you what you want to know but mostly what you NEED to know. 
Oh! and also the reading went a few minutes over the time set, I felt rushed for her but she was happy to wrap it up without ""loose ends"" which I did appreciate.",1.0
"Great location on the Strip.

I had to come here for a work conference.  I knew nothing about Vegas, so I had no idea where this hotel was situated.  I learned that this is the place to be.  It is at the beginning of the Strip around a ton of other hotels\/shops\/restaurants.  The major club, Hakkasan is where people want to go.  My sister stayed in Trump Towers and ubered to the MGM when she came with friends to start her night.  5 stars for location.

It will take you forever to check in.  They have one long line that snakes back and forth for seemingly forever.  However, the check in people are very efficient and they have all hands on deck during the busy times.  What makes the wait less long is the huge screens constantly playing music videos.  If you have to wait in line, this is it.

The room itself was nice.  I'm sad you have to pay $25 if you want a refrigerator.  Don't touch the stuff in the mini fridge unless you want to pay obscene amounts.  The walls are a little thin.  I could hear the people in the room next to me, but luckily when I wanted to sleep they were no longer partying.

The conference center was super far from my room.  It was about a 10 minute walk and I walk fast.  I definitely got my steps in.

I heard the pools are fantastic, but I never had a chance to check them out.  However, whenever I gazed longingly at them from the conference, I noticed that there always seemed to be open lounge chairs.

Overall, I think this place is a pretty good place to stay.  I'd recommend it.",1.0

"No lie the most amazing coffee I've ever had. I've been going here since the opening. Brûlée cappuccino was amazing with a hard crack candy surface on top the foam. Cotton candy espresso shot is fun to pour the espresso over the cotton candy and watch it sparkle and melt into the cup.

"Sonio's puts any food I've eaten in California to shame.  Not only did we get greeted and seated before we could blink, but the owner\/chef himself came up and personally walked us through the menu.  Such charm.  Amazing Greek\/Chicago mashup with healthy options but I went for their special burger with what I think was sirloin with cheese, homemade 1000 island dressing threw crispy romain leaves, whole pickle spears, onions and tomato and it was to freakin die for. Plus a side of Greek fries which is basically feta cheese and herb heaven. Step aside In n Out! Super authentic amazing homemade everything.  My husband had a Greek salad which was massive and had some homemade dressing on it which the owner said he worked on for six months to get right. Passion translates into food. Well done! I would come to Vegas just for this. If I could give six stars I would.",1.0
"I recently had exposure to bed bugs through my work and was concerned I had transported them home; I needed a thorough and trustworthy inspection to ensure peace of mind.  I called Burns on a coworker's recommendation and could not be more pleased with their service.  The initial phone consult\/salesperson, Kyle, was extremely helpful and spent time answering multiple questions, and our technician, Radni, was top-notch.  He did a canine inspection with Rusty the dog. It was a fantastic experience and worth every penny! Radni's knowledge base was obvious and his customer service skills were excellent - a great combination of technical and people skills.  I would recommend their service without reservation and am truly grateful for the peace of mind this gave me.  We did not need any treatment as no evidence for bed bugs was found.  Thank you Burns and thank you Radni for such wonderful service!!!",1.0

All of the flavors were really well balanced and everything was fresh! Plus they have Pure Intentions coffee. You can't go wrong with Earls!",1.0

"Can you say Supreme service and Supreme food!!! Wow this place is a Hidden gem and my Trusty Yelp app led me here with a party of 18 to celebrate my birthday. They sat us upstairs and were extremely attentive to all of our needs. Let me start off with the Portions....they are Massive and delicious! I ordered a Bento Box for $10 --- no that is not a typo... their prices are Insanely cheap compared to Most Sushi places I frequent and it is definitely worth it! They do not cheap out on portions regardless of the low low prices which is a huge bonus!!!

Our party ordered a school of sashimi and a ton of Kalbi beef ribs which were so friggin good! My bento box with terriyaki beef was delicious and they didnt cheap out on the Shrimp Tempura and salad they gave us either!

They also did not charge us a stupid cash grab ""plating fee"" for our ice cream cake we brought and did not ""auto charge"" a gratuity for our big table. They earned their tip and this awesome review with being so quick, efficient, friendly, and having delicious sushi!",1.0
"I wanted to kill time and wanted to experience things for the first time.  I figured I would go see a cheesy low cost Vegas show for the first time.  However, to my surprise, this show was pretty good.  The show is definitely PG at its worst, so it is for families with little children.  If you want an ""adult"" Vegas show (such as Absinthe) this is not the show, but you would still enjoy it for what it is.  The magic tricks were standard but entertaining.  I enjoyed his jokes and could tell that he did not recycle his jokes, as they were tailored to the audience.  When visiting Fremont, I will definitely go see this show again.  Regular price is about $24 per ticket, but you can find deals so that it's about $15 per ticket.",1.0

Actually, I love everything. 

It also helps that it's next to a bakery (Asahi) that serves green tea cake. So after you have that dinner at The Vig across the street, head on over to Sweet Republic.",1.0
"There's really not much to say.

Their food is consistent and tasty. The atmosphere is the same - well lit and in open view of everyone else dining in the restaurant. Servers are quick and to-the-point, but rude sometimes.

I'm a big fan of the Chicken & Duck congee (1 bowl should feed 3-4 people). The deep fried squid is great, as is the deep fried crab claw. Friends love the general tso chicken but I'm more of a Cantonese Chow Mein lover. 

Prices are extremely reasonable. One big tip - try to bring 4 or more people to the restaurant. Each side dish is rather large so two people will have more than enough to eat with two side dishes. If you come to Congee Queen, you should really be able to sample a lot of their dishes, so you want to bring a bigger crowd. :)",1.0

So far nothing on the menu has disappointed.  They have great omelettes. Even the cheese omelette is yummy.  Lots of cheese!  It's like eating a grilled cheese only with the scrambled eggs as the sandwich.  

My faves are the steak and eggs for breakfast and the giant hot pot roast for lunch.  The homemade pot roast is served on breadworks bread and smothered with gravy!  Delicious!  In my tastebuds' opinion, they have the best hashbrowns.

Ich muss sagen beide Sorten waren wirklich gut, wobei ich Granatapfel ein bisschen besser finde als Pfirsich. Die Musik war etwas zu laut und es war ohnehin schon recht laut, aber die meisten kommen wahrscheinlich auch zum trinken und nicht zum essen. Das essen war ebenfalls lecker!

"Bagelmania IS DEFINITELY one of the best real Jewish delicatessen deli's you will find in Vegas. It is just east of the strip in a semi questionable part of town, but anytime I go in its filled with older folks who eat brunch on Tuesdays while the rest of the town is hustling. Definitely takes me back East everytime I walk in. 
Amazing food guys -  seriously good food, great portions, moderately priced for the quality. I will gladly pay for quality food that was obviously made with love. 
Typical deli with bulk meats, they cook their own corned beef among other things. They have awesome hardy breakfast options as well as sandwiches and entres. They have a case full of salads and sides, the bagels are fresh daily (obviously) they even have the Italian cookies you pay by the pound (I believe), just like back east! 
Take an hour and stop by here for breakfast or lunch, or pick up some damn good fresh bagels for your office, you will not regret it. And I'll bet you will be back!",1.0
"Used gift certificate for spa. Had the oxygen facial and it was divine, would rate better than  the massage ! although it was  ok. The Spa itself is lovely modern ,clean , with nice attentive staff but not overbearing. Again the facial was incredible .

"Absolutely the best deal on the strip. My wife and I found this restaurant for lunch as we ducked into the Miracle Mile Mall near Planet Hollywood looking for a place to eat. Every entree on the lunch menu is only $4.99. Beers are only $3.00. We each had the grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and a fresh vegetable medley.  It was excellent and for only $4.99 unbeatable.  We also had an ice cold Blue Moon beer.  Our waitress, Sharee, was awesome. She highly recommended the salmon and we were totally pleased. In addition, the service she provided was excellent. I visit Vegas often and will definitely be back to Ocean One.",1.0
"I have to say my last review was harsh, but the absolute change in this store is amazing. I was promptly given a sample and wasn't immediately harassed with a recitation of ingredients. She simply asked if I had any allergies, which in my opinion is all that's necessary! I liked the tea and experience so much that I completely changed my mind about what I had already decided I wanted to get before coming in to the store, and got the daily sample ( organic raspberry jam) instead. This location is doing much better since my last review and I'm glad to see this positive change. I'll definitely be coming back for more soon.",1.0
"Very, very good barbecue. The beef brisket can be a little lean, sometimes, but that's just a personal preference. The pulled pork is fantastic. It's a small business, and they make the food fresh every morning, so when the food is gone, it's gone. There were times when we ordered take-out and didn't call in in time. But that's not a bad thing; it means that the food is really good. The fries are crisp and hot, the macaroni and cheese is creamy and rich. Beans are good. 
They started out in a small walk-in only space in the building without tables, and they've gone through at least two expansions to keep up with the demand. The seating area is informal and the service is prompt and friendly. They display all the trophies they've won at barbecue contests. These people know how to cook. 
It may be a little hard to find the place because it's behind a large mall, but it's well worth it.",1.0

"I really like fresh seafood. It's hard to find good quality seafood in landlocked states. 

We found this place on yelp. So we decided to cruise over and check it out. When we arrived the place was clean. The guy behind the counter was kind and patient with us as we had 5 kids with us. The pricing was about right for seafood.

Our food came out pretty quick. Large cuts of fish and the flavor was absolutely delicious. They place is like eating on the pier in a coastal area. I'm so bummed out we don't have a place like this here in Colorado. 

Next time we're in the area we will eat here again.",1.0
I can't complain with Lee Lee's. It's exactly what a guy from Hawaii needs.  They sell Poi and Lau Laus.  This alone gives them high marks in my book.  Their fish market is so so.  Sometimes the fish are really fresh other times its a toss up.  But definitely worth a stop.  The Pho place in the building is also a worth while meal if you're hungry after shopping.,1.0

I'm from Mexico and so this place felt very comforting for me :) They had an endless amount of candy, chips, snacks, and drinks from my childhood!

They were incredibly responsive, and were able to schedule me within 48 hours; even offered to ""hop the sensor in the garage"" to ensure the house remained locked after their departure.

Crust is amazing, sauce is just right and cooked to perfection. Closest pizza pie to New York style that I've seen...even better than the ones claiming to be NY style pizza. The order came with plenty of little cups filled with parm cheese and red pepper flakes. This place will defiantly be my go to for pizza!!",1.0

"Come for the coffee, stay for the desserts. The only coffee I brew at home is Kona coffee, so I absolutely love this Hawaiian coffee shop that serves 100% Kona coffee. The desserts here are equally awesome with creative concoctions unique to this coffee shop. 

The cold brew is no joke. This one will get your caffeine buzz going right away. The iced Kona coffee was good too, but not as strong. 

They also have specialty drinks and seasonal drinks. I really liked the cookie butter pumpkin spice latte. I love coconut! Between the almond joy and the coconut haupia latte, the latter was da bomb!

Coco puffs OMG. Better than Liliha. It's true! Liliha's coco puffs are just too soggy for me. Ono sweetz is perfection. 

My favorite dessert is Troy's creation the haupia bar, which is a coconut dessert that is really not too coconutty. The distinct three layers of crust, cream cheese, and haupia go together so well! 

My favorite tart flavors are: ube (the purple one!) and chantilly. 

The baristas are super sweet. Troy and Annette have made their rounds and greet and meet their customers. I love that!

The doctor was amazing and took care of my father in law in a dignified way. The nurses . I can't rave enough about them. Whatever we needed was taken care of by them before we even had the opportunity to ask. They just knew what to do and did it with respect and dignity.

"It's a small area, but there's always still a place to sit if you want. They have a menu near the register and a bigger menu on the wall behind the pickup counter. I know different people like different textures of their boba, so this place has a chewy consistency with a soft exterior and a slightly harder inside. It's not hard to chew through, but I LOVE my boba with this consistency! I've gotten the almond milk tea, coconut milk tea and the mango green tea and all were amazing.

"This pizza is the closest to NYC style pizza in Las Vegas so far. Their only down side is that it's in a casino, so those of us who live and work in Las Vegas, don't want to have to drive all the way to the strip and walk through a smoky casino to get a slice, but I still do it for this pizza once in a while. They also have gelato that's tasty and sides, and full course dishes as well.",1.0

"During the month of February which is of course Black History Month, I found myself remembering my experience at The Children's Theatre of Charlotte and the play Jackie and Me by Steven Dietz based on Dan Gutman's novel of the same name.  

I was there for a visit with friends in February of 2015 and the theatre came highly recommended for their work.  I didn't know anything about Steven Dietz, Dan Gutman or even Jackie Robinson really (the ""Jackie"" in the title).  But when my nine year old son and I walked into the building we were blown away.  The Children's Theatre of Charlotte shares the building with the Charlotte Mecklenburg Library to encompass Imaginon.  We were treated to giant puppets from the theatre's production of 101 Dalmatians.  The facility is simply beautiful, you can spend the day with the Children's Theatre of Charlotte and its library partner.  

My son and I were captivated by Jackie and Me.  We journeyed with the character Joey Stoshack back to 1947 when Jackie Robinson made history as the first African-American to join major league baseball.  Joey finds himself sharing the hideousness of racism with Jackie during his travel back in time.  The actors were grown adults; even Joey, a contemporary of my son; but the direction and acting completely suspended your disbelief.  I heard my son respond audibly to Joey's commentary that ""maybe, is just adults saying no for a really long time.""  

""That is so true,"" my son replied.

I listened to Artistic Director, Adam Burke relate that Jackie and Me is an important piece of theatre.  I really must emphatically agree.  How do you talk to your child about racism in a way that shows the true devastation?  Well The Children's Theatre of Charlotte didn't tell us, they showed us.  My son and I live in Chicago, an important mecca for theatre.  But I have to say, I haven't seen a piece of theatre for children or even adults that could measure up to the work I saw produced in Charlotte.  It was more than entertainment, it was a statement.",1.0

When I continued to have problems, the owner came by to test the moisture of the carpets, explained their cleaning process and products and what could be done (as well as those of other cleaning services - unlike others, they will clean with eco-friendly products and will not leave residue in your carpet), called out a truck to further treat the carpets, and even helped find other possible sources of the problem (humidity resulting from standing water in the crawl space - something the city inspector did not even check!) while waiting for the truck to come out.

"Not much to say about Chili's and it forever revolving menu. 

This is my experience today. As usual, and I think it must be a policy, I'm not greeted at the door when I walk in. I came in after a family of 3. No Greeter was near or in sight. The waiters were working their tables, the bar had only one patron. We stood there for a few. Another family (4) came in after us and a couple also. Finally the greeter showed up and since he wasn't there to greet us when we walked in, had no idea who came in first. So he got the family info and also the couple's .. I asked to just go in the bar area since he had no idea who was supposed to come first. 

The bartender is the saving grace of this restaurant. Lee was attentive even when the bar started to get packed with patrons. He called me by name and made sure I was taken care of. He even sweetened the unsweetened ice tea (ALL RESTAURANTS SHOULD SERVE SWEET TEA!). 

The food was good for a mid day lunch. I had the Big Bites. My problem (which would have made this a 3 star rating if it wasn't for Lee) was that the menu did NOT specify that they put bacon on them. For someone who doesn't eat pork, ruined them. Fries were a little salty, but overall the meal was good. 

SIDENOTE: I have been to several different Chili's and am never greeted at the door and usually have to wait till whom ever is supposed to be at the door to arrive. Waiters just look at you cause that's not their place.

I mean, every Mexican restaurant offers complimentary chips and salsa.  I just didn't get it.  Finally, we decided to try it anyway and I am so glad that we did.  The food was excellent!!  Everyone in my family of five was very happy with their food and that rarely happens.  The prices are also beyond reasonable.  Our total came to $55 for five dinners and five beverages.  And again, that rarely happens.  We will be return customers for sure!  I guess you really do pay for those ""complimentary"" chips and salsa in other Mexican restaurants...it's built in to the menus prices.  I'd rather skip the chips and salsa for affordable, delicious food any day.  I can eat chips and salsa at home.",1.0
"This is the real deal. I ordered the number one which was a taco with your choice of meat and rice and beans. I opted for asada. The taco had tomato, guacamole and cheese and two tortillas. The tacos are grilled so the tortilla is a bit crispy. The meat was seasoned with salt and had a simple delicious flavor. Now let's talk about the rice and beans. This is a staple in most Mexican restaurants. I am quite picky because my Mom has delighted me with savory rice and well-cooked beans my whole life. I am usually prepared to be disappointed with most restaurants. Well the rice was flavorful and the beans were delicious. These are not the beans from a can that are dark and whipped topped with shredded cheese. These looked like peruano beans. They were perfectly seasoned and were creamy but not completely smashed. Reminded me of home. I also ordered an agua de limon which was perfectly refreshing. The only thing that did not blow my socks off were the salsas. It may be a matter of preference though. I don't like cumin in my salsa and I could detect it in both the red and green salsas. I definitely plan to visit this place again when I get the chance.",1.0
"I drove by this place and the name jumped at me. Found out they do poke bowls and sushi burritos.

Concept is easy, you either want a bowl or a burrito, like chipotle, and build your meal.

I took my time looking at the menu , they let u sample if you're tying for the first time like me, I have to say, my creation combination satisfied my appetite.

Holsteins is known for burgers and shakes but they have other options food, all American inspired. I wasn't feeling a burger but I was feeling their macaroni and cheese. Lobster mac and cheese to be exact.

It was so so good. It came out hot, cheese was oozing from the dish, and the lobster. There was actually a fair amount of lobster which I loved! Awesome dish. Service was really good throughout our meal. We were even comped a dessert (it helps to be all girls on a bachelorette party). Our server came out with macaroons that were made with dry ice. I can't explain it but it was really good.",1.0

"Went there for the first today for lunch today.

Food:
I ordered CLUCKIN' GOOD WRAP for $8.50 plus tax.  The chicken was skewer pieces that seemed to be just grilled.  The taste was really good, however a bit on the smaller side.  For the price it a worthy investment.  

Service (5 stars): 
The restaurant seems to be family run, and everyone was very friendly.  
Note that the food is made from scratch so it takes some time for it to be ready.  I would suggest using the online pickup option to save itme.


Ambiance (4 stars): 
This was previously Chelo, and the place has not changed much (lookwise)  They did insert 2 flat screens on which they show the menu.  
There are a handful of bar stools and a small table, but would not recommend eating there.

"Not really sure how to review a Terminal at Sky Harbor. However, I can share my overall experiences from flying out of there for the past 25 years. Out of all the terminals at Sky Harbor #4 is by far my favorite. Terminal 4 is really big! There are lots of GOOD places to eat. The better places to eat are before you go through security. So if you have time eat before you go through security. If you don't have time there are still lots of great places to eat past security. Security usually doesn't take to long but you just never know. On average I try to be at the airport 2 hours before my flight leaves. To me Sky Harbor is just like any airport in the USA. Doesn't matter if you hate it or love it, most likely you will be using it to fly out of Phoenix.",1.0

I loved the clean and modern decor of the restaurant, which offered cozy seating arrangement. We can't wait to try the dessert chocolate fondue on our next visit. Here comes the constructive criticism:  the ribeye cut in the Geisha size pot was too expensive for 5 oz. of meat. The Yojie cut of beef offered more value for your buck, which was leaner and tasted just as good. My husband said that it was annoying that the restaurant opened for a year, but continues to list liquor on the menu, albeit they have not secured a liquor license yet.",1.0

"Loved the decor and retro feel. We ordered Cheeseburger, Andys Double Cheeseburger, hot dog and crispy fries.  Finally a spot that serves good halal dogs. The beef patties were good as well. I liked how they had 4 different cheese options for the cheeseburger. The only thing that I didn't like was the size of my cheeseburger, it was the size of a jr mac  Andys size is the full size burger. Also you can't make any of yoyr meals a combo you gotta order your drinks and fries separately. The good thing was you get a whole basket of fries instead of a few combo side size.

"Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night as we had purchased a groupon ($75 for a 7 course meal for 2). The service was great, servers were overly friendly and accommating. We first got our miso soup (delicious! Not too salty and perfectly hot) then our house ginger salad (delicious as well). We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I've had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream!

"I'm conflicted about Mandalay Bay. Here's why: 

The good:

Nice room! Big tub with separate shower. Beautiful view of the mountains. Windows floor to ceiling.

Quiet. Nuff said. 

Great exfoliating bar soap that is almost regular sized.

Wave pool with sand beach. AWESOME.  

Free tram to Luxor and Excalibur is nice.

Good room service. Actually too good. They kept bothering us and opening our door and knocking with our do not disturb sign up. 

Easy checkout. TV, phone, email, lobby. You choose. 


The bad:
Pool hours are 8am to 8pm. What?? You're a ""bay.""  How can the pool ever close? Minus a star.

Lazy River is full of pee and booze. Gross. 

Mini fridge isn't accessible for your own food. 

Its a ways from the strip and so you feel compelled to get food at 'overly priced for the quality' restaurants.

No fan in poo room.

"Came here for a family dinner today and I was left satisfied with the seafood combo (included the live octopus, sea cucumber, sea squirt, gaebul, and abalone for $98.95. This is definitely quite the experience and though a lot of people say that the octopus was nothing special in taste (which it wasn't), I find it seasoned with the sesame oil to be perfect for my taste buds. I'm a big seafood fanatic myself and I would recommend this to try for those who are in love with seafood as much as I am.

Moving onto what you pay for - it's really more of the texture than anything. All of the food within the combo are all crunchy and chewy texture. It's fairly portioned such that I think for 4-5 people it is good to share with.

On top of that, I ordered a large sashimi platter and the slices they've cut are very generous. Overall the more special ones were the salmon skin sashimi and that their mackerels were fresh - fresh that you don't taste the ""rawness"" of the fish as some other mackerels can have that real fishy taste.

"Had power steering fluid leak. Took it to Alltown to look at. The good news is that they did a thorough look at the leaking and a whole lot more, but not just to jack up the price. They gave me an easy to understand list of ""must do,""  ""should do,"" and ""should at least be aware of"" items. The bad news is that the overall problem was more extensive than I'd hoped. The cost for just the ""must do"" items was more than I had in pocket that day. I ended up speaking to the dealership I'd bought the car from and they directed me to a mechanic who they have a relationship with, and helped me with costs (since I've bought three cars from them in the last two years!). Otherwise, I would have definitely had Alltown do the work, once I had the funds for it.

With the bright lights of the wheel, it is tough to get really phenomenal photos as there are some pretty bright reflections, but if you have photo skills, you can make it work. A fun thing to do!",1.0
"If you look at my review history, I don't ever post reviews. I only have Yelp to read reviews before I check the business out. 

Secondly, I contacted Rick, the owner yesterday about 3-4pm and he quoted immediately and arranged me for a cleaning today between 2-4pm. He called me around 2:30 today stating that one of his business vans went down so one of the technician had to Pick up the slack do the other work. Needless to say, he told me that they'd be running late, it's cool, I get it, things happen. Better late than never. He showed up around 430, just to check the place and told me the van is on the way. Had a 20 min discussion about the NASTY pet smell from the previous renters left behind for my family to die in this beautiful home. I told him that my wife wanted the dining room done as well, and asked if he could charge me a bit more afterwards, he decided not to and to just throw it for free and for my previous military service he was thanking me for it. 

Joe, the technician arrived, and decided to go ahead and tackle everything without hesitation. I can't stress how serious joe was about getting rid of all the smell and the months of filth building up beneath the carpet. 
I figured since I'm the last stop before joe goes home, it's one of those ""I'll half ass the last customer of the day"" type of attitudes, but definitely not. He took care of me like I was the first customer of the day. Like I said, I can't stress enough how serious this company is about taking care of their customers. 

This business is about doing the job right the first time. Im glad I didn't waste my money on another company. I will definitely refer them to anyone I know who needs carpet and upholstery cleaning. I would give 10 stars if I could.

Thanks Joe & Rick!",1.0

Since I'm a local, our group drove to their office where the van would leave.  Before getting on the van you sign all of the necessary forms.  It's really a quick and painless process.  The van takes you on a 35 minute drive to the Willow Beach Marina.  It's small and the perfect spot to launch a kayak.  Willow Beach Marina does have facilities to use before your kayak adventure. Each kayaker is required to wear a lifejacket.  There is a little cubby in the kayak for you to keep personal items~  small but you could fit a water bottle, phone, keys.

It was a gorgeous sunny day.  The water was smooth as glass.  Our tour group was small and intimate.  Perfect.  We had a great tour guide who kind of blended into our group as just one of the guys.  Our destination was Emerald Cave which was small but lovely!  The water is so clear during the entire trip.  Just looking to the bottom was incredible. There were also a few other stops along the way if you wanted a snack that the guide brings along.  Plus you have a chance to rest and take in the scenery.  Lovely!

"My first and not last time here was pretty excellent. After a few hours on the lake, my ladies who lunch decided to eat here and no one was disappointed. 

I have to say, I'm the pickiest, most judgemental of our group of 5 and I have no complaints at all. We ate at a bar table because the restaurant seemed full and there was no way in hell we were going to sit outside in 95°F+ weather after being on a boat all morning, so it fit our group just fine. The patio did seem inviting with lakefront\/boat views and shady umbrellas...but maybe next time.

We started with the fried asparagus appetizer and the spinach artichoke dip. The dressing underneath the tempura'd asparagus was nutty, a little sweet and definitely accompanied the dish. The arugula piled on top wasn't dressed, but that didn't detract from anything. The stalagmite recreation of chips sticking out of the dip made me giggle because it seemed so 1990s, but the dip was decent. Not as good as the asparagus, though.

I ordered the grilled shrimp salad and it was flavorful and light, thanks to the bacon bits. It came tossed with a vinaigrette but it only left an oil slick on my greens, no flavor. The shrimp were simple and on a skewer with no tails. Next time I'll try a burger, like most of my friends did. No... next time I'm going to visit this place for brunch. I really want to see what they do with brunch.",1.0
"Friendliest Hampton I have ever visited! We were in town for the U.S. Open, so it was busy, and each member of the staff we encountered was more than courteous and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. From the front desk allowing an early check in for my family, to holding the shuttle to the course while I ran up to my room, along with offers of a to-go bag from the staff in the breakfast area, everyone was truly outstanding. This hotel was on the newer side as well and was a great find overall!",1.0

"I have been taking my pets to Animal Health Services for close to 10 years.  They have extended hours and with several Doctors on staff any given day it is easy to get an appointment.   Every doctor I have had the pleasure of working with has been knowledgeable, kind and an advocate for my pets health.  The facility has state of the art diagnostic equipment and while some complain services are costly, I don't feel there is a clinic that can compare to what they have to offer.  The services offered are not ""pushed"" but rather suggested to maintain a lets healthy living.  Particularly comforting is to know they have an after hours emergency clinic.  We had a dog diagnosed with lung cancer that began have breathing difficulties in the middle of the night. We knew it was time to put him down and thank goodness he did not have to suffer until morning.  The after hours vet was kind and compassionate and I'm grateful they were there.  For people who feel this clinic is too costly, I would argue you get what you pay for.",1.0

They worked up a menu for our group to allow each person to order what they wanted and allow the kitchen to be efficient.

"It's not much to look at but don't let that fool you. Well made and thought out entrees. Service was very good and manager (or maybe owner) came by to see how everything was. I had the best pork chop I ever had, he said they came in last night to start smoking them. My only complaint was I could have used more of the pan sauce. My wife loved her salmon very fresh.  Her risotto was a bit bland but maybe that's because she ordered it without bacon. We split a Caesar salad and the tiramisu was freaking outstanding. The lighting at our table was harsh, like an interrogation room, but the owner explained they were testing new lights and they'd be switched out for softer ones. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and were glad we tried it because we'd heard so many good things. A credit to the neighborhood for sure.",1.0
"Such a great little hole-in-the-wall spot! This place is a unique vegan restaurant that you must absolutely give a try! Who knew oats could go so far?! The staff is friendly, the food is amazing, and the environment is great. It feels like you're at home in your own kitchen!

"To be honest, I think carryout for dinner on a Saturday was better than eating in for lunch on a weekday. I've had their sweet and sour chicken combo which is just as good as any other place's. Their General's chicken came with HUGE chunks of chicken which I wish were a little smaller. But the fried rice is what earned the place four stars (aside from the service). I'm usually not a fan of fried rice, but theirs is so flavorful and not greasy at all! I could've just eaten it! Also their service is ALWAYS friendly and more than happy to help you, even when they are swamped. I will definitely be back again and likely try other items on the menu.",1.0

"Holy deliciousness! Prayers of thanks to the rice noodle god and his sidekick the eggroll! This will probably be my Asian (Cambodian and Vietnamese) take-out place going forward. I stopped in one afternoon for take-out (don't judge, y'all know by now I'm single and only get through life by comforting myself with a plate of food I didn't have to cook myself), and was greeted by this nice smiley-faced lady behind the counter. She showed me this amazing book filled with pictures of every dish they have! Ahhh I love that! Sometimes I go into a place and I have no idea what the heck something is so the pictures really helped in picking out what to eat. 

I went with the...
*A5 for $11.99 which is several different kinds of rolls: 2 Spring Rolls, 2 Egg Rolls, 2 Rice Paper Rolls, and 5 Mini Spring rolls. The mini rolls were my favorite, nice and crunchy.
*88 for $9.99 which is Banh Sougnh: ""fresh round rice noodles, lettuce, cucumber, bean sprouts, home-made whipped coconut milk, scallions, topped with chopped spring rolls, Asian basil, ground peanuts and stirred lemon grass with our special sauce.""To me it was like a really tasty curry with noodles. 
*98 for $10.98 which is Chha Kreoung Ma Rass Prowt: ""An exotic flavor, mixture of lime leaves, garlic, turmeric root, galanga root, coconut whip, Ma Rass Prowh (special vegetables from Asia) aromatic and fresh lemon grass. Stirred with onion, green or red pepper, chunky chopped roasted peanut with steamed rice and a choice of meat."" This was like a typical rice dish amped up a couple notches. 

For both entrees I got the combination meat (chicken, shrimp, and pork) and asked for mild spiciness. I liked #88 the best, but #98 was still pretty tasty and I am excited to go home and eat it for dinner tonight. Portion sizes are pretty generous\/typical of Asian take-out so I got several meals out of my order. I would definitely recommend! 

Only downside is that if you are inside for too long your clothes are going to have this smokey\/greasy smell to them.",1.0

"Did a tour with Remy on a Saturday. He was really knowledgeable and seemed like he was having fun with it as well. His well-timed jokes and enthusiasm for Four Peaks made the tour really enjoyable for me. At the beginning of the tour, he gave us two drink tickets. You could either get a beer flight (comes with 8 small but generous glasses) or 2 pints. Some beers are excluded, so make sure to check with your bartender.

The tour was great and the beers were tasty as well. My favorite was the peach ale. I would have gladly given Four Peaks a 5 star review, but after the tour we were able to redeem those drink tickets that Remy gave us; however, we weren't given any seating. Instead, we had to go back to the hostess and ask for a table. The bar was really crowded, and there was no way we could find a spot for six people. They told us it would be a 20 minute wait. I wish they would have let us known so that maybe we could have left the tour for a couple minutes to put our names down.",1.0

Within moments our waitress was there to take our drink order. Her name was Brittany she had a great attitude from the start. Told me about the specials. I already decided that I wanted the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy. She was on top of my drinks I never had to ask about a refill. The chicken was moist with some great flavor.

"When you enter a sushi place there is a certain level of service that you expect, provided you are not eating gas station sashimi. Sting Ray sushi exceeds expectations in that aspect. My tip, sit at the bar. This is a little known secret and allows you to customize and configure your sushi to your liking. It helps to ask the chefs and cooks for their respective recommendations and discuss what you may or may not like. I was apprehensive about trying some of the dishes at first but I came out with a more refined palate. The Nigiri was well prepared and the rolls were adequate for Arizona. The one surprising thing about this place is that they sell tacos. They are arguably the most underrated item on the Menu. The Ceviche and Crispy fish tacos are my favorite. I will continue to stop by anytime I'm at the Biltmore.",1.0

Not only do they have good coffee but they also have a huge variety of fresh sandwiches and snacks, some homemade and some locally sourced, that put Tim Horton's and Starbucks to shame. If you're at all interested in supporting local businesses that aren't run by giant chains, this is the place to go. The owners are some of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever had the privilege of meeting in retail. The convenience side of the store is full of just about everything you could imagine, making it a one-stop shop for daily needs--and it's clean and well-organized to boot. You may find it surprising, but in my ten years in Toronto, I consider this convenience store one of the hidden gems in the city.",1.0

It was neat, clean and modern, just the opposite of how we imagined a Chinese noodle place would be.  They pulled the noodle by hand.  It's fresh, chewy and lots of flavor.  We ordered the beef noodle Shanghai and the beef brisket noodle.  Very nice in a cold day.  We also ordered the dumpling, their signature appertizer.  The juice came out like heaven in my mouth.

"In all my travels, this was the first opportunity I had to fly WestJet. I suppose it's that I don't make it Canada very often (after this trip to Montreal, however, I'd like to remedy that) so it shouldn't be too surprising.

This flight from Montreal YUL to Toronto YYZ (seriously, what's up with these airport codes?) was a short one, and I was sacked out for most of it. Technically speaking, my flight was on WestJet Encore, which is a subsidiary, and it flies the little routes on the Bombardier Q400. Go look it up. It's a propeller plane. I actually like them, as the wing doesn't obstruct ground views, but if you're freaked out by prop planes then look elsewhere.

I actually booked this flight through Delta, on Delta's website. Think: Skywest of Canada. They're a low-cost airline so there aren't frills. Sorry, beverage lovers. They're not the nickel-and-dime you low cost carriers like Allegiant or Frontier, but they're not going to win any awards for luxury.

He was easy to contact, never made me feel like I bothered him and even responded to a weekend email I sent him! BUT I was still skeptical, after all it was just a speeding ticket. No matter that I was almost killed by an unlicensed driver, this guy wouldn't care to even read the police report till the day of, right? WRONG! He showed up at court like he was ready to FIGHT!!! He knew my damn case better than I did and I really didn't think that it was possible I could have missed any evidence but I did. Instead of sitting in the waiting area with me, he went right up and sat in front of the judge. It was like he was putting pressure on the judge to hurry up and dismiss this case if the cop was late. And MAN oh MAN that is exactly what the judge did! Lol, not sure if the cop hit a few extra red lights on his way to court but I sure didn't stick around to find out and neither did my lawyer. Guy knew what he was doing, worth every penny! I was ALMOST sorry to miss the show because Jushin Gill would have demolished that cop for the outrageous ticket he gave me...while giving an unlicensed driver a slap in the wrist.

"The wife and I had been wanting some Peruvian food, so we decided to go to El Chullo based on all of the other Yelp reviews.  Once again, Yelp does not lie!  Everything that we ordered was delicious!  The food was so flavorful and we enjoyed every bite that we ate.  We will definitely be back as there are so many other tasty options that we would like to try!",1.0
"This place deserves 6 stars! Beautiful high-class restaurant with a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The staff is friendly, and the food is DELICIOUS! Wow, just wow! Talk about a restaurant that goes above and beyond to make your dining experience wonderful. I already can't wait to go back!",1.0

I grew up 1 mile from the original Vincents Pizza on Ardmore Blvd.   Joe Conforti was trained by Vince himself and still makes the same great pizza from the same great ingredients and suppliers that Vince always used.  And he's been in busness for almost 30 years.  Now Joe's son runs the business.   I've eaten at Vincents in Plum Boro as well.   Conforti's is as authentic a Vinnie Pie as either of the other 2 locations.   Just as good.   Anybody who says otherwise is full of it.,1.0
Loved this place! So many burger options and made really well. I wanted to try something different so I made my own elk burger and it was fantastic. I really like that you can customize burgers here as well as going with their own options. Gives lots of variety and will satisfy anyone! I can't wait to come again and try a milkshake too,1.0
My family loves this place. Everyone gets their own pizza. The gluten free dough is really good. The toppings are awesome. I typically don't like pizza but I love the customs pizzas from here.,1.0
"Always a pleasant experience even when there's a wait. It's worth it. Food is definitely home cooking and the prices are fair. I like the two egg breakfast with country potatoes (with sauté red onions), bacon and toast. I can never finish as the portions are so big. I look forward to their coffee all week and it's very smooth and fragant, nothing like these doctored drinks you get at franchises but if you're in the mood, they can do that too.

Milo, the owner, is very polite and fun to strike up a sports conversation with any day of the week. We are always looking to support local small businesses and this place is a neighborhood gem.",1.0
"Super close to home, my husband and our son used to ride our bikes to Central Bistro on the weekends, and it was one of our favorite happy hour spots. Service was quick and great even though they were busy. Decor looks nice, but I didn't think the old decor needed much updating. This is petty but I hate the sign out front, Central Bistro looked so quaint and the ""jazzy"" sign seems cheesy to me. We had the short rib pizza which was amazing. We will be back, would love to see better happy hour specials.",1.0
"Beautiful room!!!  We inspected our room like we usually do and everything was perfect!!! Every time we called for towels, they would deliver it right away. Great service overall and very friendly employees.",1.0
"We hired Gorilla Builders to build a shop separate from our home. When we first approached them, the owner of the company, Jeff Suer, was the individual we spoke with. We stopped by their office to sign the detailed contract and went over it from beginning to end. The process was put in place and the permits obtained, building was started, and we now have a wonderful functional shop. We were truly impressed with the quality of the build from beginning to end. Each worker was friendly and knew exactly what they were doing and completed the job over and above all expectations. If we had a question during the build all we did was call Jeff who was readily available. Thank you Gorilla Builders, Jeff, Hector, Tom, Bob, all you guys!",1.0
"Had a good night out at Chicago Brewing a couple of weeks ago.  Server was quite friendly and fast.

Pluses, service and the food, very good.  

Super pluses!!! Old Town Brown Ale!  Great tasting craft beer and great price $6 for 22 ounces.  

Minus, only one.  You can sometime smell the smoke from the bar in the dining room.

"We were craving Cracker Barrel, but the closest one is by the airport and last time we went to that location my wife broke one of the rocking chairs. We looked for a similar option, and thought of Tupelo Honey. We had heard great things about their brunch, but it was already 8:00 pm so we decided to go for dinner instead.  Parking was available but not convenient, and when we realized we had to climb stairs we almost just walked to Nan and Byrons. Nonetheless, we ended up sticking with the original plan and before we knew it the two of us were sitting at a table with four chairs (all of the booths were occupied). 

Did our waitress know the menu? Yes.  Could she pair drinks with dishes? Yes, but only because the menu did it for her. I looked at the beer menu, and nothing really caught my attention, so I asked for a tap water, lite on the ice with an orange slice. My wife asked for the same, and the waitress was back momentarily with two waters, each containing 3 ice cubes and an orange slice and a plate of biscuits with a delicious honey spread.  

Took a glance at the appetizers, and nothing was appealing.  We love fried red tomatoes, and order them whenever we can.  However, we DO NOT eat tomatoes before they are ripe. That ruled out the fried green tomatoes.  The Appalachian Shrimp were tempting, but we decided against them as we had never tried fresh water shrimp before. We asked the waitress for her recommended entrees, and she described the Carolina Mountain Trout.  We had been eyeing this item before, but her description made it sound TERRIBLE.  We almost left, but it was already 8:40 and Nan and Byrons seemed like quite the hike.  After another quick glance at the menu, I ordered two Fried Chicken and Biscuits plates before the waitress could ruin them for us.  We already knew we liked the restaurant's biscuits, and we figured its pretty difficult to mess up fried chicken.  We were right! The chicken was very above average, as was the gravy that accompanied it.  There were ups and downs during our visit to Tupelo Honey, but chicken and biscuits were delectable.",1.0
"I love breakfast foods and I'm so glad I got to try this place. The food here is reasonably priced. Interior is very modern and cozy with tons of natural light coming through the windows. My friend had the real f-ing breakfast burrito and I had the lavender crunch waffle. They were both very very good. The burrito comes stuffed with meat, cheese and other things. Was flavorful with a slight spicy kick. The lavender crunch waffle was also delicious. It comes topped with toffee pieces for the crunch as well as blueberry compote. I don't know how to describe how it tastes so go try it for yourself cause you will not regret it.",1.0
"My wife and I went to Aracruz today to look for granite for our kitchen and 2 bathrooms.  First I would like to say how easy and customer friendly this place is. Everyone was so friendly and eager to help.  Kevin the sales manager helped us and I have to say, he was so knowledgeable,and had great advice for us. We never felt rushed and he was willing to answer any of our questions.  We found 2 slabs to use and put them on hold as we meet with our fabricator. Please do yourself a favor and please go to Aracruz International Granite... Thank you Kevin.",1.0
Found this restaurant on Yelp and it is GREAT!!! We liked it so much that we went back the next day. We had the seafood sizzling rice soup and the salt and pepper shrimp on our first visit. We had the sweet and sour chicken on our next visit. Not only was the food great but they also provide excellent customer service. Highly recommended.,1.0

"This is definitely one of the cleanest rest areas that I have ever come across. It is well-lit and inviting. Although you go down a long road once you leave the interstate to get to the place when you do arrive it appears to be safe. I was really impressed by the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Often on the road places are disgusting but this one was not that ba

This place has comfortable places to sit and also a great area to walk or exercise your dog on a long trip.",1.0
"Perfect date place. The atmosphere and the friendly staff. The Vietnamese coffee flavor was great too. I got it in a waffle cone and then we just chilled out back in the patio while eating it. There were also toppings you can add on there too. Great ice cream place! Sometimes, it's too great and the line is long but it's worth it.",1.0
"I'm on vacation and needed a message. I yelped to find a massage place and this one had the highest ratings. It's affordable, clean, and very good. I'd definitely come back when I visit again and let me family know about this place! It's very relaxing and worth it.",1.0
"Ok the kids wanted me to give five stars. They love the amusement park and actually we are very impressed as well by what they pulled up for the holidays. Very well done!!! The staff is extremely friendly, everybody from the front desk, concierge, pool staff, door man ....again everybody is helpful and very friendly. The only reason for four stars is due to the fact that I think the room and beds are to small.",1.0
"I came in on a Saturday night and the place was very busy. The parking lot was very full and I had to park far away possibly due to Ralphie May doing a comedy show at the Improv, but that is not their fault. They quickly sat me down and got my order and were very nice. I ordered Sprite and Portuguese chicken with rice. The temperature inside was at a good temp and the decor was okay. Pop music played at a good range. The waitress was very friendly and helpful.  When I got the food though it was just ok. I think it was good and I do recommend it, but it was really standard fare.",1.0

"I've been wanting to do a track day type of event for a long time and stared looking up places that'd let me do that. Found their ad in the car and driver magazine and booked a 10 lap run on the Porsche Cayman and Carrera. The online booking experience was seamless. They pick you up from the Aria and drop you off to your hotel which I thought was pretty good. The drivers that take you in and out are very courteous.

Once you're checked in, an instructor will explain racing lines, paddle shifting techniques and most importantly, braking and throttle control. You're given a 8min run the simulator next where you can learn the track. Once that's done, you get to meet the girls you'll be driving. The out lap is basically a warm up to get the feel of the track. From lap 2 they are all hot laps and finally an in lap. 

The instructor will constantly guide you on your braking and acceleration point and also ask you to push based on your comfort level. They say speed is an addictive drug and I can see why. Couple of hours later, I'm still beaming. 

My instructor, Cody was absolutely superb in explaining the lines and pointing out the small mistakes I was making. Once I got that into my head, I felt I was carrying a lot more speed in and out of corners, braking later and harder and I instinctively knew a good and a bad lap. It was such an awesome experience and I'll be back soon for sure. 

Thanks to dream racing for such an amazing experience.",1.0
"Pamela's is pretty great...to start, there will most likely be a wait at the door but if you sign your name up on the paper, you can settle in and think about the delicious crispy outsides of the pancakes you will want to order when your table is ready. We were visiting Pittsburgh for a family event and came across Pamela's in both the strip district and the one on Walnut street. Both are fantastic. I got the broccoli cheese omelette and my boyfriend got banana pancakes with walnuts and the ham and eggs. These are both delicious options. Their special potatoes are delicious. Coffee is brought to the table by the pitcher, which is much appreciated. Cash only, but guess what---it won't be that much because Pamela's is totally reasonable.",1.0
"Visited Jarling's while visiting my sister. There was a line that went all the way to the door, but we waited. I had a small sundae with the cold fudge and butter pecans. It was DELICIOUS!

"My husband and I have tried almost everything on the menu and we are never left disappointed. It's family owned and we are definitely treated like family every time we dine there. The Village salad is amazing, calamari and lamb chops are hands down the best. You can walk to the back where the kitchen is located and choose one of the daily specials if you want to try something a little different. All I can say is this place is one of the best on the Danforth!",1.0

"Disclaimer: I grew up in Scotland, the undisputed champion of fish and chips. Actually Scotland tops the list for anything you could conceivably deep fry. Forget the famous deep fried Mars bar, that's a gimmick, but if you happen to be in the old country and you know you need a change from the fish suppers (Scottish for fish and chips) because having it for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a week has dampened your enthusiasm, I thoroughly recommend deep fried haggis or deep fried pizza. I kid you not. 

To cut a long story short, Pete's fish and chips was the best I have had in 2 decades of living in North America. Shocking really. I mean, how difficult can it be.

As a vegetarian, this is one of my favorite places to go for lunch. I often get the pad thai. It is my favorite! I get it vegetarian, with no tofu. The service is excellent, and fast! The prices for the lunch special are excellent. You get soup, spring roll, and your main dish for less than $10! Oh, and that includes your tea if you choose to have that. Everyone in the restaurant is very nice, and very accommodating! I've been going here for 8 years. The only thing I would say is to be careful with your space number. Spice intensity ranges from 1 to 5. I used to get at 3, but have downgraded to a 2. I think the different chef are either heavy or less heavy handed on spice! Either way I'll be going here for as long as they're open!",1.0
"The scent of hot and fresh pizza hits you as soon as you walk in and the enchanting smell will leave you salivating for your own pizza. Seriously, if you're with other people, get your own.

Rejoice vegans! They have daiya cheese if you're in the mood for some cheesy pizza.

"The trick here is timing: deliveries arrive every Monday and Thursday (so on these days they usually put out 2000 items as opposed to their usual 500). Prices are similar to Value Village and quality of the clothing is high as well but the bad thing is they rarely have BIG sales; but as in any thrift store, if you are patient and peruse the racks meticulously and visit at least weekly, then you can find some beautiful treasures. Love coming here for their unique and beautiful costume jewelry. Their household section is small.",1.0

"The sort of weird vibe bar that always evolves; never stays fixate to one menu and one idea. This is the class of bar that takes its cue from Madonna or Lady Gaga, each new season it slaps on a fresh coat of paint and redesigns itself. New menu; new idea; primo ideals. The one constant: excellent quality.

Vegas For Insiders: The Velveteen bar is internationally know for its drink menu. Its gold standard, The Green Bitch, is a chlorophyll monstrosity developed by Pamela Dylan.

Lovingly renovated! The tiling sparkles when you walk in. Beautiful exposed brick and solid wood panels. Top notch cocktails and modern food pairings. Radishes with hummus. Salmon with mustard butter. Sausage with turnips. All delicious. The setting looks like an updated 1960s Manhattan steak house but airy. The ownership shows a love of food and attention to atmosphere. Service was friendly and professional. Local food and wine highlighted.,1.0

I would definitely recommend this place to groups of friends or businesses that want to do team building activities, since you NEED to work together in order to make it out alive!",1.0
"Located in a strip mall so one might be hesitant when they see the surroundings.  BUT, it has a lovely atmosphere.  It is a little loud especially when the entertainment starts.  However, the single singing voice added to the ambiance.  Excellent service, great food and very reasonable.  Restaurant was very crowded but fortunately they accept reservations.  They also have a large selection of clever t-shirts and wine paraphanelia for sale as you walk in.  Items for sale are tastefully presented and center around the wine theme.  Recommend eating in the wine room - nice setting.  Definitely would go here again.",1.0

"I come here with friends all the time for board games! I love the Bam Bam Chai and all their desserts! (We once got the Sweet Treat platter and every single thing was DELICIOUS.) I also love the Ballad Salad, the falafels, and their delicious raisin pita! The specials are usually great, but the one time I didn't like it, they took it back and didn't charge me for it.

The board game selection is really great and often the management will come back and check out what we're playing and see how we like it. 

The only downside is the service can be pretty hit or miss. I'm not sure if this is because we normally sit in the back, but we often have to hunt someone down to make an order and sometimes the we'll get a dessert before our main! haha.

Desserts included very good gelato, and a grand marnier soufflé that was one of the lightest I've ever had.",1.0

"This review is long overdue! We've been coming here pretty much every week for a few months to get their amazing banh mi sandwiches. 
We've tried the beef and the grilled chicken and the flavour in both is killer - something about the way the chef cooks the meat, it's very tender. It's such a simple yet flavourful sandwich and the price? It's about 6 bucks for a large- you can't beat that!

The service is always on point - the family is very warm and welcoming, they know us by name and what it's important about any restaurant is the consistency and this place is always consistent! A hidden gem in my backyard and I'm so happy to support a local business like this!",1.0

"I would only come here for their omakase sushi. Their aren't that much selection in their normal dinner menu, and portions are small and quite over priced. As for lunch they don't serve the izakaya items so essentially only the Ramen would be the go to option.

Omakase Sushi ($120 per person)
There are only 8 seats at the bar for omakase so you have to make reservations 2 days in advance. The 2 day notice is because they have to pre-order the fish from Japan. 20 course meal mixed with sashimi, sushi, grilled fish, cooked food, and dessert. All 20 courses were really good. The fish was fresh, and every dish was well seasoned and flavored. I like how they prep their sushi - the chef adds small condiments to the sushi to help bring out the flavor of the fish. 
At my visit they served grilled blue fin tuna cheeks! This is really rare, the highlight of my night. It tasted really good - soft but slightly chewy. 
I also really liked how they served the uni sushi. They provided a towel soaked in matcha tea for you to wipe your hands. This is supposed to bring out the flavor of the uni. They then directly serve 2 pieces of uni sushi in your hand (one piece male and one piece female). Did you know uni has gender as well? The dark dirty yellow looking color is male, and the lighter bright orange color is female. 
Overall the experience was amazing - it was like a mini performance watching the chef prepare and cook each course. Of all omakases that I've been to, this is definitely the bang for your buck spot in terms of the raw fish quality, the selection of fish, and the number of courses offered for that price. It's rare to eat omakase that's filling and too full for dessert!",1.0
This place was kind of like all the other middle eastern joints in the area. They aren't anything too fancy. I got the gyro wrap and it was pretty good for what it was. I wasn't too intrigued by it. The service was a little slow but the staff is very friendly. I'd come back again but this time as a takeout option.,1.0
Desert Saddlery is one of our first stops on Saturday. Tom is the only person on the east side (and maybe the whole valley) that does saddle\/tack repair and custom work. His stitching is as strong as it comes! I've never had anything he repairs break again. He has saved our gear tons of times. The whole crew makes sure you find what you're looking for and are more than willing to search diligently to find it. I could not think of a better place to purchase tack. Lifetime customers for sure!,1.0
"My daughter and I tried out Killer Shrimp last night prior to a movie. It as Happy Hour so we had a few appetizers and drinks. The server forgot my glass of wine but it came when the food did.  One of the appetizers we found had too much fried coating on it, so we didn't eat much of it. Otherwise it was all ok. What I did really respect, is that a gentleman who I think might be a manager, could sight of her and I not being keen on that appetizer. I saw him go towards the server, and when she appeared with the bill, they had taken it off. That is considerable customer service and very commendable. We are going to go back next week and give it another try, but this time try some of the entrees that they specialize in. Good job in recapturing a customer they might have otherwise lost.",1.0

"We discovered the Lakewood location of Bottle House Brewing Company early in the summer and have returned several times. We were thrilled with the delicious and unique craft beer and ale selection-mostly their own brews. Everything we tried was delicious. It is so refreshing to go to a place that offers something other than the standard craft drafts that every other establishment offers. The bartender was welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about his products. I had never tasted mead, so tried one of those as well after the bartender answered my many questions on what it was and how it tasted. We ate there the first time we visited and our meals were both excellent. However, the menu is currently limited and they hope to expand it in the near future.

The owners need to do a website for this location (like the one they have for the Cleveland Heights location) because right now it is a hidden treasure in Lakewood and not easy to find with on-line searches. It's on the corner of Chesterland and Madison. If you like unique, craft brews and meads, you will love this place. I give it 5 stars for the brews, bartender and background music and hope to add another star once they get their menu worked out.",1.0

It's small, but they're quick & worth any line you'd have to stand in. Never disappointed & always took corporate, family & friends when they came to visit. Unfortunately I moved so I won't experience as much, but whenever I'm back in town it's a must! GO HERE NOW",1.0
I have four boys that attend Go For It USA.    They love it!  My oldest son has been on team for 5 years and we just adore his coach.  Everyone is so friendly and it is a great gym.  I would recommend it for anyone wanting to get there kids involved in gymnastics.,1.0

"I hardly ever leave Yelp reviews, unless the service is outstanding or horrible. I bought a house and needed it to be rekeyed. Got quotes from a few places, and the best was Joey at King Key. He was communicative throughout the whole process, let me know when he left, when he was close and when he couldn't find my house (cause I gave him the wrong address. Oops). 

He got here, introduced himself, took a look at my locks and went right to work. One of my locks was badly damaged, and he showed me how it was damaged and why I needed to replace it instead of just saying ""oh this is broken you need a new one"" and charging me for it. 

Throughout the whole process he let me know what he was doing, and made conversation with me. He was the nicest person I could've ever asked to come over to change my locks. 

I could not recommends King Key any more. Don't bother looking anywhere else. Go with King Key.",1.0

"Great experience with these folks!
We were in Vegas for a bowling tournament. My wife did not realize how far we were fro the strip. So we called Summerlin Enterprise based on the 'We pick you up' ads. Garret was friendly and arranged a pickup to occur in less than an hour. Jim called and asked if he could pick us up early!. Once there, we got our car and were on the road in less than 10 minutes. On the day of return, despite about 5 people in front of me, I was checked in in less than 10 minutes.
Jim ( once again ) had me back at my hotel less than an 40 minutes after I left it. Professional all around and I wouldn't hesitate to rent from them again.",1.0

I always have a ridiculous amount of dog hair and they do a great job at cleaning it up. It's not a guarantee that they will get 100% of it out but they do a good job and I have no complaints. 

Staff is always super friendly and the girls are super sweet at the register! 

Particularly the guy who did my car last was really awesome. I took a while grocery shopping so they parked my car off to the side. They keep your keys safe and that was the hugest relief! The guy who did my car (I wish I got his name) came over and went over what he did with my Husband. He thought I was trying to tell him he missed something when I called him over, rag in hand ready, I told him no that he did great and tipped him. 

Favorite place to get my car done. Highly recommend!

Good atmosphere and service was great. Pizza was ok. Standard no dimension to the pizza sauce. No bread sticks. Only cheese pizza that they cut different but we didn't get it.

"Ok.  I have to admit - having lived in L.A. for 5 years has tainted my palate for authentic Mexican food. However, Los Guacamoles blew it out of the park.  Delicious, fresh, authentic fare - and well priced.   A nice surprise, because so many of these bandwagon 'taco' restaurants popping up around Toronto are generally mediocre at best, and the price for the tacos are insane.  

The patio out back was killer, service was amazing and the food was amazing - even the house wine was pretty damn good.  The interior is eclectic, cozy yet modern - with amazing murals along the walls including my gal pal Frida Kahlo, of course!  Owned by Mexican restaurant vet Lizbeth Orea - formerly of Dos Amigos - she has really taken it to the next level.   When I'm in Toronto, this will be my go-to spot for fresh, authentic Mexican cuisine.",1.0
"Food is alway Great. The staff very friendly!!! Always has smile which goes a very long way. 
They had one young man working there......WOW so impressed I wish I had his name. He could not stop cleaning the dining room and just could tell he was happy to have a job. I don't like to describe people by their ethnicity but the only way they may know who this young gentlemen is, is by me letting them know he is a young african american man. I have to say it take a lot for me to be impressed but I could not stop admiring this gentleman's working skills. 

Congratulations Five Guys Management, for serving good food, and a strong team.",1.0
"This has easily become my definite go-to Thai restaurant around the Strip. I've found this hidden gem only recently and I wish I could have known it sooner. Arawan has everything I love as much as Thai restaurant can get: Great authentic Thai food? checked. Top quality service? checked. Plenty of free parking? checked. Fantastic desserts? double-checked!! If you haven't done so already, do yourself a favor and tryout their desserts like the Earthquake, Mango Island, and the Sweet Sensation Crème brûlée.

"Great bike shop. Found espada here on Yelp. Gave me a great deal on a rebuild\/tune up on my dad's old Gary fisher mountain bike. This bike was in rough shape when I dropped it off and he had it looking great and riding smooth in just a few days. I was totally blown away by how clean the whole bike was when I picked it up!!! Rides and looks like it was brand new again!!!! 

He had a decent stock of new and used parts\/bikes in the shop. Kept the cost low on my rebuild by using everything we could off my bike and some used parts he had around the shop. 

This is exactly the type of business I like to give my money and support to!! The man stands by his work. 

I'll be bringing my canandale by soon for a tune up.... I didn't really think it needed one until feeling how smooth the Gary fisher rode and shifted after he worked on it!!! I'd recommend Espada to anyone for any of their bicycle needs!!!",1.0

"Price: $10\/person, you got a large bowl of ramen
Service: 4\/5
Food: 4\/5
Recommend: obviously the ramen dishes
What to expect: Toronto has many Japanese ramen places, which has egg and rich soup. Chinese ramen is lighter, and you could try with beef, lamb, or different variety.

I went to this place for a meetup lunch event. I had some ramen back in China, this place is pretty good, more like a non-fancy warm-your-stomach home-cooked ramen.
I had ramen with beef and sour cabbage, which I really liked. The sour cabbage gives extra favours.
The waitress is pretty friendly and the place is considered to be clean in Chinatown.
I would probably come back again with my ramen-enthusiastic friends.",1.0
"WOW! Completely amazed by this place. You need prescription glasses fixed, THIS IS YOUR PLACE! My father has glasses from a designer that are hard to find. He accidentally sat on them snapping the frame arm off. Since the glasses are frameless frames, this was a difficult repair.

I finally went here for the first time on Monday night! I seriously had the time of my life! I came with a huge group and they made the experience even more fun. The music they were playing was on a hot roll and I couldn't stop dancing lol I also loved that they had the $10 all you can drink ;) (I got to number 5 lol) but of course I tipped every time so I can get good service! I must come back here soon! Lol,1.0

"We had the unfortunate experience of having to bring our cat in last evening and shockingly having to put him to sleep after finding out he had advanced cancer. Our two year old male cat had been sick with gi issues for a few days and then suddenly started vomiting bile so off to the emergency vet we went. What was a suspected intestinal blockage turned out to be a mass in his abdomen and cancer spreading to his lymph nodes. The tech and vet we saw were amazing and sensitive. Dr.chu sat with us and explained all treatment options with empathy and caring, and answered all questions while my husband and i discussed options. We never felt pressured to chose anything and ultimately chose to euthanize him with the gentle guidance we received. While it's nice to know they offer a lot of oncology treatment options, it meant the world to not be pressured or guilted into choosing that path. The cost of the trip was reasonable as well, much less than what we expected for all of the testing that was ordered. If we ever need to make another trip to the emergency room, which I pray we won't for our other cat, I would absolutely come back here.",1.0

"First of all, this will be the last year anyone will have a chance to play golf on the Las Vegas Strip. There are rumors the course will be replaced by either a large lake, another hotel, a playground (wtf?), or (hopefully) a football stadium for the Raiders.

It's expensive, but worth playing, especially in the hotter months like July (for the $). Just do an early tee time and you'll be done within 3 hours or less! This course plays pretty fast, and offers a well designed course by the talented Tom Fazio.

The course is beautiful and immaculate--easy to find your ball, especially since you get a caddy, which some were on the pro tour for years. They give you something like 8 water bottles and 8 Gatorades in the ice chests. You don't feel like you're in the middle of the Strip, it's so lush and green. Only indications are the tall hotels popping up here and there.

There's no beverage cart though. The driving range has a net, since space is of utmost value in these parts. I'd also expect a GPS tracker on the cart for the price you pay (but I guess that's the whole point of a caddy). However, given the price and exclusivity, we didn't feel rushed, were treated very nicely, and really felt like the only ones there!",1.0
"Bang for your buck. Delicious Mexican dish served up by super friendly staff. Came by Tuesday after work for take out. We ordered the Tabasco combo and the Mexican Combo which came up to around $25.

I'm not a big fan of their buffet though. It sounds economical but its tough to maintain the same standards during 'mass production' I guess.

"Uber x is not allowed in the airport. However uber select and above is. Uber select and uber black appear to be the same as our driver was dressed nice, carried our bags and had a well kept SUV. Pick up appears to be at the ""outer curb"" so you will need to cross the crosswalk to get to the vehicles. Cost? 2.50 per mile vs 3.50 a mile for Uber black.. If you would like to take an uber X you will need to leave the airport premises first. However it's half the cost of uber select. My suggestion is if you are traveling further than 10 miles from the airport  you may want to get off premises and get a standard uber x if you want to save the money. Perhaps you want to take a cab? Apparently cabs will not be serving the airport much longer? Also, the cabs have a standard $16 fee for any pickup from the airport plus mileage.",1.0

The first impression of a dental office is always the front desk staff. When I called to schedule as a new patient the woman I talked to was friendly and welcoming. On my two visits in since then I've found the front desk ladies to be friendly. Every part of the office from the waiting room to the exam rooms are clean and inviting. Each cleaning area has a TV overhead for entertainment during your cleaning. Love that!

My hygienist is Monica and she's awesome. She makes dental cleanings as painless and pleasant as a dental cleaning can be. Monica is really friendly and fun to chat with at appointments. She makes appointments more like catching up with a friend. She does a great job getting my teeth nice and clean too! I've only met Dr. Hill one time, at my first visit, but he seemed nice.

World of Beer often plays host to special beer events and tappings, and the staff at this location does an amazing job of handling the influx of guests. From the tables of 15 folks with all separate checks to the potential to run out of tasting glasses, they always are quick, efficient and handle the situations with a smile. Not to mention, the staff all go to beer school and are truly knowledgeable and can and do answer any of your beer questions.

They all seemed genuinely happy to be there. 

I had to order contacts and went back to get them weeks later and they remembered who I was, which was nice as well. I can see how others complain about time, but they do let you know when to expect them and depending on what you're getting... manufacturers can take their sweet time.

I ordered the Tonkotsu black with thick ramen noodles per a friend's recommendation and felt it was decently satisfying. The broth was rich (though a bit salty for my taste), the noodles were nice and chewy, and the ramen already came with a soft-boiled egg and the choice between bamboo shoots, black fungus or corn so I felt pretty full after only half a bowl. I also had a bite of my friend's karaage which was cooked to perfection, so if you're looking for an appetizer that's the one.

They would have gotten the 5th star if their grill's food wasn't so terrible. If u have the option go somewhere else to eat.  The free breakfast in the morning is good but anything else they serve is terrible at least for me. Also there are no prices on the menu so u have to try and guess. Other than that they are awesome.,1.0
"Best tasting sushi in the valley with great prices! The actual cocktail list is a rip off $9 for the smallest drink, Not worth the money, stick with saki! Very clean and pretty fast for a busy Saturday night, expect a wait small environment but worth the wait. They also have an excellent children's menu, my daughter loved the yakisoba chicken and veggies it was delicious. They also have a couple tv's with the football game on, Always a plus.",1.0
"This salon recently relocated to Mint Hill. I have been at least 10 times and have been well pleased each time with the quality of their work.  They are all very friendly and speak to their clients in ENGLISH and don't speak Vietnamese to one another during the whole service.

"So happy to have found this place for lunch today. Hubby and I go to Jamaica every other year, so our expectations for authentic Jamaican food was in the, ""I hope it's at least close to what we're used to."" range. Wow, they blew us away. I had the Oxtails entree, and hubby the jerk pork . Both were amazing. All entrees arrived piping hot and the portions were huge. The food had the perfect amount of flavor and spice, plenty of gravy, and I didn't need my knife because the oxtails were like butter. We also had rum cake (yum!), and took home an order of jerk chicken for later. We're both kinda of coffee snobs, and the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee was delicious.

Side note: I had their homemade lemonade and I haven't had better lemonade since I was a kid when I used to visit my great aunt in Birmingham, AL.

P.S. Don't know why it's listed in the three dollar sign range. They are definitely in the two dollar sign range, which is another reason for my 5 start review.",1.0

I am equally excited to report that they make really authentic food and that the owners are some of the nicest people I have ever met. They went above and beyond to make sure that everything in my order was perfect.

I have so far only tried the chicken banh mi but could already tell that it was super authentic, in addition to being tasty. I grew up very close to the ""Little Vietnam"" of the greater Washington DC area and grew up eating banh mi at least once every few weeks. I think this is the real deal and very much look forward to trying the other sandwiches!

Today was the 1st time I've ever tried a cronut, which they have to rename ""crodough"". The story is that ""cronut"" is a copyrighted name for the people who invented them in NY. This donut comes in 2nd w\/the keylime following VERY closely behind. We almost ordered more, but we decided no to give us an excuse to come back for more!

"I've never thought, despite me being very disappointed in my actions and numerous days of stress - my experience with Brian D. Sloan representing me as my lawyer has ever gone so smoothly. He was always there to answer questions whenever I would become super anxious as to what kind of consequences I would come across moving forward with my life. I always got a firm and direct response from him, and just in that, I trusted and knew he knew he cared for his clients - in a very professional manner. He got a plea agreement for my case and lowered my charge down to Reckless Driving with no jail time and no license suspension, just fees. I was very lucky and blessed to have stumbled upon his page on a last minute Google search before working with any other lawyers I inquired for. A very rightly intuitive decision to have connected with him.  I am very satisfied with the result and have learned a life lesson having gone through this process.

"I finally had the opportunity to try Byblos after struggling to secure a reservation on a weekend a number of times. Settled with a 6:30 pm slot on a Monday evening and although it was relatively busy, you could probably take your chances doing a walk-in on a weekday.

Contemporary decor but still had a very classy vibe. 

Lamb Ribs ($14) - These were delicious but tiny!! 3.5 small lamb ribs (the 4th one was more like a twig with barely any meat) that are tender, mildly flavored with a crispy texture. Not exactly the best value but taste-wise, 4\/5  

Roasted Red Beets ($13) - I debated whether or not to order this dish pretty much until the very last minute when I decided to just take a leap of faith and trust my fellow Yelpers. So glad I did as it was the highlight of the night. I was hesitant because my boyfriend and I aren't the greatest fan of red beets but you can hardly taste it when mixed with the labneh which had the perfect consistency and creaminess. Served with some delicious barbari bread, this dish is one you don't want to pass up on. 5\/5

Crispy Squid ($13) - This one was a decent portion but the individual pieces of squid are very small. Lightly fried and the spices and garlic sauce (toum) give it a nice kick. Very flavorful dish overall and tasted great with our rice. Probably one of the least traditional items because frankly, it's basically calamari with some Eastern Mediterranean seasonings. But I wasn't there to judge (nor would I know) how authentic their food was, so 3.5\/5 

Turkish Manti Dumplings ($14) - I was looking forward to this the most but it ended up being the biggest disappointment of the night. Such a shame. The dumplings were underwhelming to say the least. I actually didn't even know they were filled with eggplant until the fourth one or so because the ones I ate prior had nothing in it. The molasses balanced the yogurt really well but other than that, nothing special. 2\/5

Tartufata ($30) - Probably the most expensive rice I've ever had.The truffle and mushrooms were decadent and the fried chick peas were amazing. Crispy and flavorful. The rice itself is very ordinary. So all things considered, I can't say it was completely worth it. I wouldn't order it again because I'd like to try their other rice offerings which looked and sounded just as appealing. 4\/5

Seared Cauliflower ($8) - It's considered to be a side so I'd recommend ordering this with one of their meat dishes (ribeye, lamb shoulder, etc.) because I think it'd compliment it quite well. We just thought cauliflower with duck fat sounded awesome so we couldn't resist and ordered it anyway. I prefer stronger flavors so I loved this but heads up it can be a bit heavy. 4\/5

As for dessert, we had the Loukmades ($12) - Fantastic! We were pretty full and while waiting, we kept negotiating how many bites each person would take to finish it. Ended up fighting over the last piece. Pretty much burnt honey icecream on a krispy kreme donut (but a different shape). So good and a must-order!! 5\/5  

Service was lackluster.  Our server was kind and filled our water pretty often but eventually disappeared. We found ourselves waiting a lot - to order dessert, to ask for the bill and to pay. Service shouldn't end after the customer finishes their main course but rather when they walk out the door. Also, typical of many high-end restaurants, they explain what's in every dish but it was spewed out so quickly that a lot of it was incoherent. Didn't really add any value to our dinner.  

A little overhyped but I'd come back because their menu still has a few other interesting items I'd like to try. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking to celebrate a special occasion or somewhere nice to go for a first date. Just don't expect to be blown away.",1.0

"Really digging the vibe at the new Warner Rd location! Had lunch and drinks with my mom; we sat at the bar and the bartender was awesome- friendly, engaging- plus THEE best Michelada's! We had chili relleños  and pasole, which we both enjoyed. Homemade tortillas!!! So good. Although service (food) seemed to be a little slow, I don't think it's anything more than adjusting to a new location, etc. All the staff was very friendly! It felt like a place you could be a familiar face at and I'm definitely looking forward to going back!!! Check it out!!",1.0
This is the best place I've ever eaten at. Gino is the nicest person to meet. The entire staff is extremely charismatic and eager to please. This is a must try in Vegas.

"The place was only good, but perhaps a bit overhyped.  We got the Funky Monkey and the southern Waffle. 

Funky Monkey: came out beautiful looking, however in the end it was a regular waffle topped with bananas, a peanut butter concoction and chocolate sauce.  Points for concept, but taste wise could have been easily replicated at home or elsewhere

Souther' waffle: gets more points for taste. There were pieces of sausage and green onion mixed into the waffle batter, which made for a nice surprise every few bites. Pico de galo topping was fresh as well. 

Overall, for a standard 1-1.5 hour wait on weekend brunch, I probably wouldn't go back. Neither of the dishes we had were great enough to say, ill come back just for THAT.",1.0
Fantastic! We had tabbouleh and smoked eggplant appetizer and they were both awesome! They don't mind giving out generous portions of their table bread.  My husband had the lamb shank and I had the grilled chicken kabab sandwich.  It was way too much food so dinner tomorrow.  For desert we had the date like cookie bar - om!! Only negative was they need more floor space.  The design takes up a lot of valuable real estate that I am sure is costing them money with so much kitchen area.,1.0
Jayd does a great job! I have gotten a few airbrush tans by her now and they always turn out great. She answers all my questions and makes sure everything is perfect! I would recommend highly recommend bronze Buddha!,1.0

"After trying a number of dishes, I really like their food! It's much better than I expected. 
The Mahi Mahi bowl was very good (especially with their hot salsa) and the salmon plate with slaw was even better! If you like salmon, this dish is a winner. 

I also had the carne asada tacos and the chile relleno. I was surprised that the portion is one relleno and not 2, though it was a pretty good size. The presentation was great but didn't make up for just that one!

For appetizers, the guac is impressive, and the crab ceviche tacos were excellent! Their chips and salsa are good as well. Prices are moderately expensive, with entrees ranging from $15 for chicken tacos to $25 for the salmon plate. Happy hour is 4-7 Mon-Fri with $6 margs and $6 menu items. The house margarita was fantastic, and I also had the Heat of the Moment, served with 2 red chiles, that was just OK.

The one dessert I've tried is the churros ice cream sandwich. Another winner! The decor is upscale and the murals on all the walls are impressive. Music is too loud for my taste. If I may be so bold as to make a prediction, this place may be around for just as long, if not longer, than the space sat dormant!",1.0

"Our group of seven tried Nani Restaurant last night. The restaurant has two large rooms with booths and round tables. The tables have lazy susans which allow you to easily share dishes. There are also multiple tanks which allow you to see the seafood you may be eating later.

The menu has two sides. One side has appetizers and entrees divided up by vegetable, pork, beef & lamb, seafood, chicken and duck. The other side has 63 dim sum type dishes priced based on size (S, M, L, Special). Although they don't roll carts past and have you choose plates as in a traditional dim sum restaurant, you can order what you like and they will bring them out as each dish is prepared.

We had a nice waitress who explained how to order, took our drinks, and answered many of our questions. Dishes were brought out by whomever was available when each platter was ready to be served. Everyone was friendly.

We started with the Deep-Fried Crab Meat & Seaweed Roll. It's a crab-stick (imitation crab) wrapped in a slice of seaweed and then deep-fat fried. The seaweed flavor is very strong. I'm not a crab-stick fan and this did not change my mind.

This was followed by Chaozhou Style Dumpling. The contents of this are mainly diced carrot and chest-nut and some sort of meat. It's quite crumbly. They are steamed and the wrapper was much larger than the contents inside. A dipping sauce would have helped this dish tremendously.

My favorite dish of the night was the Baby Cuttlefish with Curry Sauce. The cuttlefish were bite-sized and tender. The curry sauce was just a tad spicy with tons of flavor. I will order this dish every time I go back.

We also had the homemade Fish Balls. These were incredibly dense, chewy, and not particularly flavorful. They were much better once I starting dipping them in the curry sauce left over from the cuttlefish. This dish should really be served with a sauce.

The Pan-Fried Vegetable and Pork Bun was another success. The bun is sweet with just a slight crunch from the fry. There is a light coating of oil giving it a beautiful shine. The insides were savory and light. I would order this again.

We also enjoyed the Pan-Fried Green Chive Cake. These chewy\/doughy dumplings were loaded with chives. Excellent flavor. I would order this again.

Our last dim-sum plate was a Baked Creamy Egg Yolk Bun. This tasted just like Bisquick Coffee Cake. It looked like a cross between a steamed bun and a muffin and had a brown sugar filling. It was fine, but not something I traditionally associate with Chinese food.

From the appetizer menu we tried the Jelly Fish with Szechuan Sauce. I love to try new things. The sauce was spicy and delicious. The jelly fish were cold. They have a texture like tendon. It's dense, chewy, rubbery, and almost crunchy. I'm glad I tried it, but I would not get it again.

Also from the appetizer menu was something called Chiu Chow Style Marinated Platter. This consisted of tofu, duck feet and tripe w\/some beef or pork pieces which were marinated and served cold. The meat pieces were OK. I'm glad I had a chance to try duck feet, but they are just chewy skin covering bone. No flavor; not an appealing texture; I would not order this again.

Our of nine dishes I tried, I would only recommend three. However, there were dozens of other dishes to try and I was not necessarily ordering dishes I expected to like, rather trying new things. I will definitely go back and try more.",1.0
"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to Hickory Tavern in the Northlake Mall area of Charlotte. This sports bar chain restaurant offers a wide variety of menu items from chicken wings to crab legs and steak, although they streamlined their menu since our last visit.

Dora here. Hickory Tavern is one of those go-to comfort restaurants for me. You know what I'm talking about, right? When you're tired, don't really know what you want to eat or you just don't want to cook, Hickory Tavern offers an eclectic variety of choices for the whole family. And with all the big screens located on every wall, you can almost kick your shoes off and just relax. Almost. lol.

As you can see, we're early eaters. Anybody else staring at the clock, ready to eat by eleven thirtyish? No? Okay, that's why we beat the rush. :)

The Shrimp Po' Boy features breaded fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickle, cajun remoulade served on a toasted hoagie roll with a side of my favorite tater tots. I don't often order a Po' Boy sandwich but after enjoying this one, it might just be back on my items to order more frequently. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the Cajun remoulade is what pulled this entire sandwich together. 

Dora here. Not sure why hubby's short on words today. Hmmm. Anyway, the Chicken California Sandwich minus the mushrooms and avocado was moist and juicy and tender, and the bun soft and fresh. Delicious!

Reminded me why I like this place so much, and I admonished hubby that we need to come back more often. It's just a bit of a drive to make it a regular place. The food seemed to take awhile, but so long as the iced tea kept flowing, not a problem. :)

We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

"The legendary Bloody Mary is reason enough to go to The Hash Kitchen (THK), but it turns out that they serve up some awesome breakfast dishes too.  They also have a wall of fame with all the athletes and celebrities who ate here as well.

I rarely get Bloody Mary's, so I opted for the THK Bloody Mary instead of building my own.  The drink itself was spicy yet refreshing, and had a smoky flavor from bacon-infused vodka.  I enjoyed all the edible condiments: celery, bacon, pepperoni, pickles, and zucchini.  Perfect appetizers.

The sweet potato hash with lump crab meat came with two soft poached eggs and hollandaise sauce was outstanding.  My wife found it a bit rich but I like pairing egg with real crab meat. 

Chicken and Waffles was another excellent dish, especially with fried leeks on top.  Waffles had bacon bits inside.  Chicken was breast only but had crispy breading and soft, juicy interior.  It rivals our previous favorite chicken and waffle at San Francisco's Bluestem Brasserie.

"Update 10\/18\/16 - I've eaten at the Fashion Square, Scottsdale, AZ location 2 times & it is an excellent burger. My personal favorite is In & Out, followed by either 5 Guys or Smash Burger.
This is a softer bun like 5 Guys (best fries ever).

"On holidays and looking for something different for dinner we decided on Mexican. We opted for Los Taquitos because it was close to where we were staying and we found information online that said Guy Fieri had visited one of their sister locations with good reviews. We browsed the menu online before placing our order in the store. The lady who took our order was amazing and soooo patient. This after my going through and taking the cilantro off and adding lettuce and cheese to three out of four of the menu items I ordered. Two of the people in our party ordered burritos (shrimp and green chile pork) and the other two ordered street tacos (carnitas and asada) and between us we tried the tostadas (carnitas and asada). The shrimp burrito was good with a little bit of spice (possibly in the wrap)?, my hubby enjoyed the green chile burrito but wished it had been a tad bit spicier. I had the carnita and asada street tacos which were delicious. The asada was so tender and so savoury, I am a big fan of the carnita but this time I completely favoured the asada. The tostadas were delicious - crisp shell, beans, meat, cheese and lettuce. My mum loved the refried beans, said they were the best she has ever had, the rice equally good. Our only complaint was that the guacamole was a bit bland but the rest of the food more than made up for that. We didn't eat in the restaurant but this place had a funky casual vibe so maybe that is something to try next time!",1.0
"Someone told me that this place was rated the best Mexican Resturant in Arizona. I was not disappointed. The drinks and service were top notch. The atmosphere was a real plus, be sure to ask for outside seating which provides you a table with your own fire pit. Simply over the top. The food presentation was nicely done and the homemade guacamole prepared at table side was worth the trip. We were staying at the Fairmont with friends and went here twice. Great experience a must try place to have a relaxing dinner with friends!",1.0

"Great place to eat and catch an amazing view.  We made reservations for a party of 17 about two weeks in advance and these guys were great.  I dealt with Donny on the phone and ""Team Kevin"" (waiter and assistant were both named Kevin). Everything that was put in front of us was amazing...apps, soups, salad, mains and dessert.  Everything was perfectly cooked, flavorful and well presented.  It's not easy to accommodate a large party, but these guys did it.  If you spent all your time reading reviews on where you should or shouldn't go, you'd never do anything.  This place was ""Old School Vegas"" all the way, I loved it.  I'd give 5 Stars in a second, but there was a problem with the A\/C so it was a little warm, (we had a few pre-menopausal women in the party...they don't like a warm room).  The only other critique that I'd make, was the lack of music. I like a little ""background music"" for dinner ambiance.  Kevin said they usually have it on, but didn't that night for some reason.  Anyway, go check this place out, take the waiters recommendations (a good waiter won't steer you wrong), feel the rich history, enjoy the incredible view and taste wonderful food in an atmosphere of a different time in this cool Vegas Steakhouse.    

One last thing I forgot to mention...since we had a large party, the tip was already included in the bill.  I didn't see it, (a few glasses of wine, and 46 year old eyes), I tipped on top of the tip, (by a lot of money),  Kevin caught it before we left and he refused to ""keep it"".  You can't beat character, and honestly!",1.0
"Sushi-oriented Review:
I have ordered sushi from several places around Etobicoke, and hands down Gohyang has the best quality sushi & the largest portions for their prices.
I have ordered pick-up from them over 10 times and am always pleased with their timely food preparation. The portions are always large and their packaging is always neat and meticulous. The special rolls are amazing. I have had the Salmon Lover, OMG Roll, Volcano Roll, Gohyang Roll & Spicy Salmon roll, all of which were great. The spicy rolls actually have a bit of a kick, unlike most other locations in Etobicoke. I will continue to order sushi from them for as long as I live in Etobicoke.
 
I have also dined-in 3 times. All 3 times the staff were very friendly and the food was prepared quickly.",1.0
Took my kids here twice. This place is great. Friendly staff. My kids really enjoyed the PlayStation games. That was a first something you don't see at bouncy houses. All the bouncy houses were very new with pretty bright colors. Just puts you in a happy mood. We will go again :),1.0
"I tried this place a few months ago and have to say I was very impressed with their food.  So much so, that I've gone back several times and introduced numerous people to it.  Their beer is not too bad and they have a wide selection.  Definitely going to keep coming back.",1.0
Went there last night before a move mine at Galaxy theatre. The staff was super friendly the beer was cold I had 6 wings (hot) my wife had chicken fingers with garlic dipping sauce . The chicken wings and the fingers were both cooked perfect and very tasty. We will definitely be back again. Reasonably priced also.,1.0
"Hidden gem!!! 

I had to stop here to grab my friend a drink cause she was dying in my car in this Vegas heat.

This place is a one up version of robertos for sure. Robertos is honestly my go to spot because I'm gross but this place was like the Target of tacos. They have a huge selection of tacos, burritos, and breakfast stuff. Prices are super cheap. What sold me is that they have street tacos.... YESSSSS! They have a super clean restaurant as well as a drive through. I got the carne asada tacos on corn which were fuego. They also have 1$ chicken taco MONDAYS. Yay!!!!

The location is unfortunate, it seemed like a burger joint until I read the sign.

Well I found this place on Yelp from checking what the Elite's in the area had said about it and than you international elites for helping me find somewhere that was really fun to visit! 

This is a smallish space with not a lot of room hang around in. I really didn't know what to pick or what size or anything and the server was lovely and patient with me and even more so when I said i was stopping in DC for a few weeks and she said she was from DC her self.

If you are visiting Pittsburgh you should go here. If you are from Pittsburgh you should take your friends there no matter how many times you've been yourself!",1.0
"This review is based on the fact I only order shrimp and fried chicken tenders or chicken wings. For whatever reason, this location has the best shrimp, always fresh, sweet, and never overlooked. I always get 1lb (or more!) of shrimp, with hot n juicy spices and medium heat, and it never disappoints. Perfect blend of spices, lots of garlic, and a ton of butta! Chicken tenders\/wings are a perfect way to balance the heat. Definitely a place where you have to okay with getting down and dirty to eat and be okay breathing garlic for the rest of the evening. Food has always been consistent times I've been. 

Service is a a different story and never has been consistent. I've had really great service, where my drink never reaches the bottom, or like tonight where we asked 4 times for ranch and twice for drink refills. Fortunately the food is good and the shrimp keeps bringing me back!",1.0

"We decided to try this place since I was wanting Mexican food and it was near enough to our hotel as we were staying at the Bellagio. First thing to know this is more Mexican fusion than true Mexican (I am a Texas so real Mexican food to me is something totally different). So while I was wanting fajitas (which they don't have), I ended up with the chicken quesadillas instead (and they were wonderful). They have a decent enough beer\/wine selection and our waiter Marco was attentive, friendly and helpful. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well. The prices were reasonable and we enjoyed our dinner.",1.0

"Love this place! For $100 2 adults and 2 kids got in for all you can eat pizza, fried chicken, salad, pasta, deserts, and drinks. Also came with 2 cards that cost $25 for 125 credits with 2 rides each. In Las Vegas there isn't much to do for kids. So when my niece and nephew came to town I was happy Johns opened up. We all had a blast and was stuffed full of food. My favorite game was the bowling. I'd say that's a stress reliever lol. Make sure you have the points loaded on the card. Return at a later time and cash them all in at once. Also love the themes of dinning rooms. Something for everyone.",1.0

On certain games you can easily buy the cheapest tickets and ""upgrade"" yourself to the first three rows behind the dugout.  Who knows you might even score two foul balls and have one signed by my all time fave Giant Will the Thrill Clark!

Right off the bat the staff was very pleasant and attentive. My husbands coffee cup was never half full the entire visit. We were able to pick our own seat and the specials were displayed nicely. 

The menu selection was pretty standard, with a few unique twists thrown in(breakfast monte cristo!). I ordered a mushroom Swiss omelette and my husband had their veggie lovers skillet. We were excited to see an array of fresh veggies used. The skillet breakfast was both colorful AND flavorful. I had huge pieces of baby portobello mushrooms in my omelette. For the price, they definitely didn't skimp on ANYTHING. 

I think once they get some more staff hired this place will be fantastic. My husband and I look forward to coming back for dinner soon!",1.0

"Was this the BEST dry cleaning I've ever had? No, but was it one of the most affordable? Probably. For the $2.75 a piece I'd say it's worth it. There is usually a line, especially after 4pm but it moves pretty quick. Make sure to bring cash to pay I think there is a fee with a credit card. My pants come out smooth and clean, I had a pen stain that didn't totally come out but was a lot lighter.

Also got a Grilled shrimp vermicelli ($9.50) which was yummy as well but nothing to write home about. Above average flavor and quality but the portion was a bit smaller on this dish.

Service: aside from having our original seats given away to another party Bc they don't listen attentively, our server was amazing. He made the experience worth it and was knowledgeable about diff Flavors that work well with different dish and drink pairings

"First, I want to say any bad reviews about Excalibur is HOGWASH and they probably drank their daily dose of Haterade!!! Bill and the Excalibur team are beyond professional, they are an example of excellent customer service and quality work.  I had front bumper damage to my 2015 Acadia and took my vehicle to three different collision\/auto body shops and Excalibur was the place my husband and myself chose because Bill quoted us a reasonable price and we like to keep our business in Streetsboro where we live.  I scheduled an appointment to bring my vehicle in thinking I only had cosmetic damage, that could be repaired in 2-3 days, and the Excalibur team immediately noticed I had damage that could cause safety issues.  Bill called my husband with the news and we knew had to get it repaired. Bill not only worked with us to give us a reasonable price, I was given a rental vehicle to drive while my car was still in the shop, Bill waited past closing time for me to pick up my vehicle after I got off a 12 hour shift, and they detailed the inside & outside of my truck with tire dress.

I got the mayo pork don. the meat and soft boiled egg are super flavorful and the cantaloupe makes it all really fresh and light.

One of the best breakfast places around. I went to the original back in Denver when they first opened with lines around the door.

"Partner and I went here on a Groupon that was gifted to us a while ago. Don't remember what either of us got but I remember leaving the place feeling crestfallen and too far uptown for my liking. 
Our time here was marked indelibly by the fact that we were there on a Groupon - like they were discounting our experience of the place because we were getting a discount. Although I understand that the point of this service is to get people to come and discover your restaurant - I feel like it should be in a business's best interest to captivate their diners so that they wish to return at regular price. This place didn't seem to do that, like the whole Groupon thing was a way to drum up some temporary business in a winter lull when their patio is out of service. This is evidenced by the skimpy experience they provided us and, what I assume, to be other diners there on a voucher.
The place is massive - outfitted with a small dining room and a much bigger, cozier-looking space. The ""grouponers"" were seated in close quarters in the small dining room, near the drafty-ass door and given the same cookie-cutter experience. Even the desert was pre-made and sat in the freezer so that it was difficult to cut and stuck to the plate. The waiter was so casual as to short us on our change for the tip - I don't remember how much, probably a negligible amount, but it felt presumptuous.  
My only advice to this business is to strive to maintain a level of excellence across all strata of patrons, it may foster enough goodwill for them to return. Having felt thoroughly second-class I will not return, discount or otherwise.",0.0
"Great location & the yogurt is actually pretty good. The topping bar has a lot to choose from, but if it's busy there's not a lot of seating!! I do like the waffles. 

However my most recent visit was disappointing. I bought a groupon that stated 'one per person, one per visit'. To me that means each person in my party can use one $4 groupon at a time. Not to mention with the waffle each of my kids spent an additional $3 over the groupon price, BUT when my kids got up to pay we were stopped after the first groupon told we could only use one per family!

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

Dominic
************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he ""should"" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 ""I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy."" 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.",0.0
"Do NOT buy groupons for shows here.  I bought 4 tickets 2 days ago for a magic show.  Decided to attend yesterday.  Tickets says to arrive at 3:30.  We arrived at 3:00. Stood in line for 30 minutes  Only to be told that general admission tickets have been sold out and I could not use my Groupon unless I wanted to pay 10 extra dollars per ticket and me and my family would all be separated in the theater. We declined that but were told we could come back the next morning to the other box office in the mall. We were told to be there at 9:30am to get our tickets for the 4 o'clock show.  We waited in line for almost an hour only to be told that the show had been completely sold out for two days and there were no tickets available at all. I told the lady what the people down at the Saxe Theater he told me the day before and she said she didn't know why they told me that because there are absolutely no tickets. Fortunately, Groupon refunded my money. But lesson learned, do not buy Groupon tickets for anything in Vegas.",0.0
"We were in the area and decided to visit Island Flavor after reading several rave reviews and checking out pictures on Yelp (mostly just looking at pics). Everyone seemed to praise the furikake chicken, so we ordered that. We also ordered sesame poke and the beef teriyaki after the waitress suggested it as a 2nd entrée. 

The furikake chicken was described by one reviewer as ""life-changing."" Well I'm writing this review the morning after and I can tell you I feel like the same person I was before dinner and it truly wasn't all that. The breading is thin and crisp, with a strong sesame oil aroma and sweet flavor. They use a combination of light and dark meat. Furikake chicken is a solid 3 star dish- nothing more or less. The beef teriyaki was teriyaki... the sesame poke was great, though. The cubes of tuna melt in your mouth. Probably could have marinated just a little bit longer, but still delicious. Huge portions!

We also ordered the guava cake and it was both beautiful and delicious. It really doesn't need the whipped cream dollop, though! It mixes oddly with the flavor of the sauce. Our slice of cake was huge and was the best part of our dining experience. 

The restaurant was clean and I noticed they have received an ""A"" from the health department. Kinda funky lighting, but still a nice aesthetic. All of their tables have pull-out chairs, no booths. Service was friendly, but it took a very long time before our water was refilled, we were offered dessert, or we received our bill. We probably won't return before trying other bookmarked Hawaiian spots.",0.0
"I have to admit, I was pretty disappointed with my burger. It was an ""avocado burger"" that... if there WAS any avocado in there, I sure as heck didn't find it. I asked for medium rare and got WELL well done. Like, burnt-to-a-crisp well done. My husband was disappointed in his meal for other reasons. It would have been a total bust if not for those desserts. Oh my god. I've never had such wonderful desserts in my life. Truly. Sad burger. Mind-blowing desserts.",0.0
"I'm going to give them a 2 star because what they offer is a bargain for this area but what we have here is a mediocre bowl of Chinese Ramen. Admittedly, the noodles are actually pretty nice with the distinctive chewiness and crispness only hand pulled noodles can ""pull off"". However, everything from the soup that lacks flavour to the tough to chew beef brisket really drags this place down.",0.0
Worse customer service i have had in a long time. It all depends on how that manager's day is going when they first opened they had a great menu you could make a good plate but every time i went back they changed the girls at the register try to help but like i said the manger gets a wild hair up you know where and changes how they sell form day to day the thing that made me right this and never want to spend another dime there is last week my girl and i walked to order there were to ladies in front that said he just turned the fryer back on and the food was hot and fresh but when we went to order he whispered something to the casher and see the said we are closed. That is cool we left and went to captain D which had great customer service and the food was hot and tasted better anyway when we drove back home we passed pear 16 on the way back home he was open and serving people i will never go there again besides that a the same dirty manger who operated mr. Cs and. We all no how nasty that place was.,0.0
"Sure wish I could have tried this waffle! I purchased this deal on groupon and could not wait to try on our way back to Cali. 
After waking up from a hungover night, we decided to get up early and walk to the waffle bar so we could take advantage of sitting in the Las Vegas sun eating waffles on our last day in Vegas.

After walking through Ballys we finally got to the waffle bar only to be told that they were out of waffle mix and we would need to come back later! So let me get this straight... a waffle bar out of waffles on a Sunday morning?! 

Although I was super annoyed and hungry, I nicely asked the lady if we could use the groupon for something else, I noticed doughnuts, juices...etc and she said No, there was nothing she could do. 

I was so baffled by this I walked in a circle for a minute trying to comprehend what was happening but needless to say, this place won't last long if they keep this up. They are in a brand new area in the center of the strip...Tourist surround you and if you're going to be a waffle bar that runs out of waffles at least give me a resolution, don't send me away empty handed. Horrible service, never tasted the waffles.",0.0
"This hotel is disappointing, but served adequate for my fun running group's Halloween '15 weekend.  I feel bad for anybody who thinks they're in for a romantic weekend at this ""boutique hotel"" -- they're going to be very disappointed.

Here's why:

- Rooms are beat up, although large rainfall shower was nice.

- In-bedroom jacuzzi tub was dirty, rusty, and I felt at risk of an STD by just looking at it (pics coming up, of the jacuzzi, not of STDs).

- Dog turds in the lawns about every 10 yards.  People, please clean up after your friends.  Rumor, please clean up after those irresponsible people.

- Jet takeoffs and landings -- depending on wind direction -- overhead every couple minutes. 

Other stuff:

- Pricing was pretty high for off-strip, about $175 a night.

- Pool areas are fairly clean and well-kept.  

- Staff was generally friendly, although somebody turned on the sprinklers while our band was playing outside.  Fortunately, no equipment was damaged.

- Hard Rock is across the street.  One of my favorite Vegas places, the Hofbrauhaus, is across another street.  And that funky KISS tribute place, which has the indoor, glow-in-the-dark mini-golf course, is next door.

- During checkout an employee was fielding a call from someone presumably calling to make a reservation.  The employee kept calling the place ""chic"" over and over.  I don't think the caller knew what the word meant.  I also don't think Rumor knows what that means.

-They charge a mandatory resort fee, that standard Vegas way of extracting more cash out of you while not including it in the advertised room rate. Your mandatory resort fee gets you something other hotels won't give you:  free porn on, yep, Channel 69.  That's not just a rumor.

You could do a lot worse than Rumor in Vegas -- and yes, I'm calling out the adjacent and scary Alexis Park.  But in this price range, you can do much, much better.",0.0
Ordered food for pick up during my lunch hour and they said ready in 30 min. I arrived 30 min later at and had to wait until 11:55!  They could have at least offered me a drink of water after I wasted my lunch waiting. All to receive a tiny peace of salmon in my very dissapointing salmon bowl .,0.0
It was the worst time when I went there. The owner was a horrible person. He treats us so badly because I prayed. And they brought us an old bread.,0.0
"This place looks great from the inside, and it has a unique menu. However, the service we received was completely rude and unacceptable. Our waitress (the woman with the skull tattoo on her arm) yelled at my friends, said she was cutting them off, and accused them of slurring their words, even though this was untrue and everyone had had only one drink. They had taken a few minutes to remember the name of the tequila they wanted and for some odd reason she mistook this for drunkenness- which she should be fired for, given she works in a bar and should know better. Everyone had been very polite to her, and this was a complete shock. We politely said okay, we will take our check then- and in response she flung the check down on our table angrily. When my friend told her, look- it is my birthday- and I don't appreciate being spoken to in this manner- the waitress obnoxiously responded ""do you want to speak to my manager?"" Which is a totally disgusting response when  someone who isn't drunk is telling you it's her birthday. Friend did end up speaking to the manager who said he would talk to this horrible waitress, but who knows. My advice: DO NOT GO HERE. TERRIBLE SERVICE and none of us (6 total) will ever be back.",0.0
"These guys ought to get out of the fast food business. They are pathetic at running a fast food store. Slow, unorganized,  lost! 
They run a park-thru, not a drive-thru. McDonalds Corp should take the entire State of Arizona back from the franchise.  10 minutes for a cup of coffee in the drive-thru just shows that no one is focused on operations. And Corporate in Chicago wonders why the stock price struggles to go up while they allow crappy customer experiences. Corporate is so far removed from the customer experience or reigning in their lousy franchises that I'm sure they will continue to be baffled on why they are losing customers.",0.0
"The worst Albertsons I've been to. I only go for a few things I need. Bought yogurt there to come home to see that it's 2 days past the expiration date. I got ice cream there that was so hard, defective, it wasn't even edible. It's worth the drive to go somewhere else.",0.0
All staff was incompetent I asked three sales persons for help everybody just said basically find it yourself. If it's not on our shelves then we don't have it !,0.0
Food was not that great! We had lunch here so not much going on. I'm sure the night life is much better!,0.0
you need to clean your ice machine. every drink with ice had dirt in it. SO GROSS,0.0
I started out wanting to like it. Too many things changed my mind. The waiter altough very nice  took a while to get drinks.  I did enjoy the small plates. My husband and I decided to share an entree which there were two maybe. We got the chix and so dissappointed when it came a quarter of a chix looked like it was plopped on a plate. No presentation what so ever. I think for the cost you could have had a vegetable and a grain and still made money.  The noise level as the night went on got really loud.,0.0
"I don't know why I keep coming here and expect things to change. It always the same thing, not a lot of food for a lot more than you should pay. 

At some point, Pita Land was one of the best lunch values i could find for middle Eastern food for lunch. Well, Mediterranean at least. I was always a fan of getting Gyros salad which mixed with all the toppings was always a steal at around $6.

Now? It's the same as many other places, a ton of lettuce and then they put away the tongs and take out the tweezers to pinch and add minuscule amounts of toppings for everything not called lettuce. Barely any actual gyros and they look to charge you for every add on including peppers, mushrooms, hummus, etc. 

That same salad I used to get is now about $11 for the same amount of food. 

Don't get me wrong still tastes fine, still not bad at all. I'd definitely want to eat more of it. Just not at that price.",0.0
Horrible service. The people were rude and I waited forever for my food even though the place was empty. And the tables were all sticky.,0.0
"I would not recommend this company.  Many of my items were damaged as a result of how they loaded the truck. They tried to say it was from movement,  however that is their way of brushing off reality.  I worked hard for these items,  now I am left with deep cuts and gouges. Do not use this company if you value your property.",0.0

Bad Bad business! The manager on duty yesterday had very poor managerial skills!! I feel like when we are dieting and only get meat and cheese tiny bit of salsa and yet I'm charged for the whole bowl!

"The one star is for the atmosphere. The rest of this place is complete s**t. My boyfriend and I went here to get a massage for our anniversary, and left feeling worse than when we came. I got the FB Reflexology massage, and the guy went WAY too hard, everywhere. As he went over my back, the bone in his arm played up my spine like one of those wooden frogs. Not fun. Left with a huge knot in my lower back too. My boyfriend got the FB Massage, if you can call lightly rubbing the skin a 'massage', and could only enjoy the fact that he at least got a punch to the foot. Yikes. C'mon you guys. I've been to some pretty bad places, but this one tops the cake.",0.0
Chicken n broccoli tasted like it was just doused in soy sauce. Everything else was mediocre at best. Poor customer service. They took order down incorrectly (probably bc they were also taking phone calls during my order) and acted like it was my fault. I will not eat here again.,0.0
"We went to this Dunkin Donuts and waited at the drive through for 5 minutes. We decided to go in because the line didn't move at all. In the store, there was only one other customer waiting for their food. The employees walked past us numerous times and never acknowledged us or said they would be with us in a minute. There was a manager doing an interview in the customer area of the store and she saw us waiting for at least 5 minutes. She didn't say anything either. Needless to say, we walked out without ordering. We understand if it's busy, but it's extremely rude to not acknowledge your customers waiting to get their order taken. Also, the inside of the store wasn't even busy.",0.0
"The food first and foremost is amazing.  But unfortunately, in today's world the food alone will not make you a winner in the restaurant business.

3 stars bc of the service.

Judy, our waitress took our order 15 mins after being seated, no smile, felt like she was rushing the entire thing. 

We ordered two main dishes along with a Sunday ice cream to share for desert.  We barely finish our meals and the check comes; again worst feeling in a restaurant esp one in Vegas is to feel rushed or like we are being kicked out.  

Judy forgets our Sunday.  Other restaurants would of compted it or at least apologize for the mistake. Not happening here.

I would more than likely come back in hopes they train the staff a little better.",0.0

"So we have been trying this place after my one star review... And nothing has changed, maybe worse. We ordered a shish kebab salad with no feta and scallions. Guess what? It came with both and we sent it back. What did they do? Remove the fata and scallions and bring it back. Now, all the meat is sort of cover with feta (white spots)... Terrible treatment. They have been going down hill for a very long time. They might charge more if it os going to get the quality a little back to normal. I do see us giving this place any more chance. Sorry :(((",0.0
"Nice décor, but I was not impressed with the food on my first visit.  Menu is very busy, seems they are trying to be all things to all people.  The sushi rolls were fair, I would not order them again.  The bruschetta was good.  I wanted the sliders but was advised by my son that they were way to salty the last time he ordered them.  Probably not going back.  It was nice but not memorable.  I ordered a glass of Zin but it tasted like cough syrup. When the waiter asked how the wine was, I told him and he just looked at me and didn't even offer to swap it out for something else.",0.0
"June 15, 2016
My wife and I went to the Bell & Grand location (on a rare occasion when we had a babysitter) to get some pricing options on redoing our home kitchen. 
After milling around the kitchen department looking at sample displays for 15 minutes and being ignored by the two employees there, we finally approached one to ask for help. We were told that the only employee who could help us was on lunch break and was due back any minute. So, we waited. And waited. 
Now I worked for several retail companies in my younger days, including Home Depot, and I've rarely encountered lunch breaks over 30 minutes for even a full time worker on 8-10 hour shifts.
After waiting about 30 minutes for the employee who should've been back ""any minute"" we got bored and browsed the store, returning after a few laps to a still empty desk. We tracked down an employee from a neighboring department and were again told ""she should be back any minute."" At this point we had been in the store about an hour. After another fifteen minutes (even an hour long break should've been over by now) we had had enough of our time wasted.
Needless to say we won't be back to this store.",0.0
"The outside of Casa Loma is beautiful, the castle is just an amazing sight. But when you go inside it's a different story, it's pretty much the complete opposite. After hearing about how I should check it out, my mom and I made our way here but we basically spent 40 minutes and left. The rooms are basic looking, there's nothing that pops out and it's like looking at the same thing over and over. I definitely don't recommend paying 25 dollars just to come inside, you're better off going to another place and spending that money. I was really disappointed but you live and you learn.",0.0

"My extended family members like the margaritas here so we have eaten here a few times. I love their fresh flour tortillas and salsa. I ordered the  vegetarian burrito our last visit and was seriously surprised at how they made it. The burrito had steamed cauliflower, broccoli and carrots (think California blend) wrapped in a tortilla. No cheese, no rice, no beans, no peppers, no corn, nothing I might usually expect to find in a vegetarian burrito. It was not good. I'll stick to chips and salsa next trip.",0.0

Got to the restaurant around 845pm, and there were 3-4 tables seated and a couple of them were waiting for food, which should've been a sign that I'd have to wait a bit for my order. Got myself the Koo Koo bites combo with rice, veggies and two small pieces of tofu, as well as a winter melon milk tea altogether for roughly $13 - about what I expected. Waited about 20min for everything to be finished which is a little longer than I would've liked though.

"I do not have a habit of writing about my dining experiences nor the food offered at restaurants. The reason I am about to write THIS review is because I am disliking a trend I am observing, the trend of cultural appropriation in the culinary scene in Toronto. I agree novelty, creativity, and innovation in food and dining experience are becoming the staple of the industry and the standard by which we assess or evaluate a restaurant. Chefs are becoming 'artists' and restaurants are turning into 'fields of experiences.'  Granted. Check. Yup. I like that.  

Yet, here's the ""but:"" 
The novelty or creativity should not come with the cost of misappropriation of a culinary culture, loss of taste in food, nor with the price of condescending the patrons of the restaurant. In my experience (last night) this place did exactly all of that lat night.   

Let me start by the menu. The restaurant takes the patrons as under-educated or as ignorant consumers. For that, it liberally uses random (and dare I say again, random) mix of Arabic, Turkish, and Persian words, only to exotify the menu.  The menu is a tasteless verbal mix of an 'exotic' otherness! 

The food itself. The lamb, chicken, and calamari tasted alike (almost identical). Easy: just burry them in the exact same blend of spices (that are used in pinched moderation in Mediterranean or MiddleEastern culinary scenes). Then voila, you have identical taste profiles. Let me put it another way: the meat, vegetables, or even the rice, were carrying devices for EXCESSIVE salt and spices.   And yes, the Barbary Bread (the most common bread in the Persian world) was dried up, over toasted, covered with a mountain of salt, and priced as high of a tall mountain. 

The service (rather, the server) -- thank you very much, I can read. But if you allow me some light and grant me a minute to go over your jungle of words that you call a Menu!  

To sum it up: if you want Mediterranean or Middle-eastern food, then get out of downtown busyness and drive up to a local authentic restaurant. There are many of them in Toronto.   If you want to feel posh, to feel exotified, to join in appropriating other cultures, to feel you've become 'cultured' by having Barbary (read: bread), then by all means do support this restaurant and do become a fan. But for your own sake, don't fool others about the menu, the food, or the service!",0.0
"They do good installations, when they want to.  I went in and looked for a specific type of installation.

First they said they could install it but wouldn't guarantee it to work as it should (why?) then they back tracked and told me that they would only install items they sell.  Gee, I wonder why.  Clearing more than $500 on the deck then on top of it, their excessive installation charge, and I can see where their coming from.

I didn't have to wait that long because I am 99.999% sure the mac and cheese is actually Stouffers. Stouffers mac & cheese has an iconic flavor to it, pretty hard to duplicate, and is just something you recognize when it hits your lips. 

The falafel panini came with pesto. I should have realized that those two flavor profiles would not be complimentary. Ugh. I couldn't finish it.

"If it were possible to review with zero stars I would. This was my second visit to this nail salon and it will be my last. The first time was fine enough that when my normal place was booked this weekend I gave it another try. Fail. Major fail. I selected the vanity nail bar pedicure, which included a callous removal and sugar scrub ($40!). The callous removal took her 20 seconds and the scrub (and subsequent ""massage"") went no higher than my ankles and was not rinsed off but rather lotion applied on top of. I brought my own lotion due to sensitivities but should t have bothered. The scent of the scrub was so potent that even after washing my legs as soon as I got home it still lingers. Additionally, they never washed my legs but rather ran a hot towel over to remove the scrub. It didn't. Again, I had to wash my legs as soon as I was home. The shape of the nails were so bad I had to ask her to fix, which was a big mistake. I went with a darker color and the color bled on my cuticles and the clean up did nothing to remedy. I was so blown away by how bad this was going I decided to skip out having her so my nails. Upon checking out she gave me the total and then when she handed me the receipt and I asked about where to top she said I was supposed to tell her before she ran the card. She never asked. My tip on this salon - save your money and go somewhere else!!",0.0
"Grew up going to all the Native chains. Visited here 9\/27\/16 .... first and foremost the pricing is outrageous! It's been awhile since I was here. A dozen wings is $12+ !What happened to the steak AND curly fries! BOTH gone?! All wings come out on one plate so if you have multiple flavors your wings end up with dry rub and sauces mixed together. 
You guys used to bring out napkins, plates and a plate of ranch before the food even came. This is no longer and what a bummer to have to wait for the server to go get ranch while my food gets cold.

"They dont even deserve this one star.... This whole place is a joke and the owner herself is the icing on the cake! I went there saturday morning (yesterday) It was my first time there getting my nails done..... I usually go to ongle spa saint-laurent (which is the best place around seriously) but no one was there do to nails this day and i badly needed to get them refilled so i went to the closest place around.. Which ended up being a big waste of my time and money! 

So first thing first, i get in, the lady who's serving me his not fully able to speak french or english fluently. I asked her if they were doing some acrylic refill and she tells me ""yes, go pick the nail polish that you want and sit there""....  While she was doing my nails, she decided it was okay to take some of them off for some reasons and told me it was now going to be 40$ (even though a new set of nails is 45$ lol) but as she start doing my nails i see her dip my finger in some powder and reapplying some product on my nails.... And from this moment i got somehow pissed without showing it...... Im not into resin nails at all and i took the time to ask if it was acrylic and it clearly wasnt.... the lady endedup telling me she didnt use it because the smell of the acrylic products are too strong?! Like this is not my problem..... i come here ask you for acrylic nails, you do tell me you make those, you take my nails off and after starting to aply your products you dare to tell me you dont do acrylics?!?!? What is this bs service....... but i was still being polite and just sitting there on that lil chair still wanting to get done with thoses nails.....  but then she started filling my nails and thats where it got fucked up!

There was a lot of gap that she didnt fill with her products and my nails were terrible, they didnt look like a mess to everyone but to me they fucking did, cause if im paying some 40$ dollars nails, they better be the way that i like them you know! 

Anyway, i endedup filling my nails by my damn self in front of the owner while her employe was screaming at me and she was just sitting in front of me blown away by what was happening, not saying a single word lol . I couldnt even believe it myself. I left 30$ on the table and left without any nail polish and no nothing

Perhaps the customer needed to be redirected about the store guidelines, however there's a correct way to inform customers of proper store guidelines. Management here doesn't do it properly. Also. Management should learn how to not continue arguing and escalating situations.

"The Real Housewives of Anthem were definitely in full force on a recent Saturday evening and who could blame them?  With the nice décor, cool bar and tasty cocktail list, coming in with blow out and a fresh manicure for a glass or 3 of ""Man Candy"" (actual name of cocktail, not from an actual cock) makes for a solid call.

I like the concept, but there were enough items that didn't shine.  It's a little unfair comparing this to Simon's Carson Kitchen, but with both being equidistant from home, the downtown counterpart is a clear notch above.  It wasn't like dinner was a total loss as there were a couple of quality items. 

Loved:

Whole Smoked Romanesco: It may look like something from outer space or a gremlin's head, but it was fantastic.  This love child of broccoli and cauliflower topped with the zesty capers, raisins and red onion made for an amazing vegetable dish. 

Date & Bleu Cheese Jam: The sweet and tart dates combined with buttered almond spread over delicious bacon bread tasted like a luxurious peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I could chow on all day long.  I enjoyed the subtlety of the bleu cheese which added a nice little twist to all the other flavors going on.  More bread was ordered to finish and it was the best thing we ate.

Didn't love:

Spicy Shrimp: $20 for 8 pieces of shrimp in a below average Thai curry.  The bread was a waste.  This doesn't belong on the menu.

Crispy Oysters:  I love raw oysters.  I even like deep fried oysters.  But breaded, fried and then served cold?  Absolutely not.  Sure, it looks pretty in pictures, but the texture and taste were not desirable.  We even debated whether to finish the last two on the plate, but the principle of paying and thinking about all those starving children in Africa cajoled us into seeing it through.  Give it to me raw.

Tongue & Cheek Agnolotti:  It was surprising just how much peppercorn sauce the relatively good pasta was drowning in and the rich-on-rich flavor did not jive with me.  Photos I saw online had much less.  What happened?  It could have been a stand out!

Snails Wellington: Bardot does it better.

Mandatory valet:  Bullshit.  Last I checked, this was Henderson and NOT West Hollywood.  I have to tip a kid to drive my car less than 50 yards away?  Fuck that.

"Liked their back patio. Unfortunately the ribs (back) were simply not cooked long enough. Really hard to even cut them apart, and when biting in - meat was very hard. Not impressed with the sauces either - as they come the ribs are dry - there are three sauces available on the table: spicy, medium and sweet. Tried the mixed green salad and purple slaw and both were incredibly oily - oil is basically all you taste. 
If you go, I think the beef brisket might be the best option - tried the tips appetizer and was definitely the best thing we had there. Macaroni balls were cheesy and pretty good too.
The back patio is nice, service is prompt. But we went for the ribs and were disappointed. And it was really expensive as well - about 200 for 4, with two appetizers, 2 full racks of ribs, 1 beer, 1 shot, one ice tea.",0.0

"If i could give this company 0 stars I would.  They came to my house to put in a new windshield.  They guy who installed the windshield is very knowledgeable, they only issue was he sweat so bad it got all over the inside of my car and seats.  I do not mean just a little bit of sweat, it was pouring off of him.  Then I guess there were clips missing, so they needed to be ordered.  I was right there when he called the office and talked to the manager who said she would order the clips.  The installer told me they would call me in the next week or 2 to install them when they arrived.  After 2 weeks I did not hear anything.  I called and talked to the manager who argued with me saying they never would have installed the windshield if a part was needed.  Finally she said she would call the installer and get back to me.  She called back and said ok, we will order the part and we set up another appointment.  2 hours before they were due to come install the part, they called saying they did not have the part and we scheduled another appt.  They took a lot of stuff apart to install the clips including my windshield wipers.  The next time I went somewhere i tried the windshield wipers (which were only a couple of months old) and they were no longer cleaning my windshield, so i had to go buy new ones.  Also, it was a nightmare trying to get the $100 from them they owed me per their coupon.  I had to call 7 times.  They kept lying to me saying it was mailed, then i would call back and they would say, oh it was returned, we will mail it again.  The last time I called they told me oh the company who sends the money out is behind in sending them.  Bottom line, I would never use this company again.",0.0

The air conditioning in my apartment was leaking and they entered my home without calling me or notifying me in any way. Came home to holes in my wall, fans running and my sons stuff moved all over the floor.  I thought I had been robbed until I saw the fans.  When I complained about this the next morning the manager told me it was ""an emergency"", but next time they would try to call.  When I told her it is illegal for them to enter my apartment without notice and without my permission she became even more hateful and, basically, told me they had a right anytime they want.  Not true and I should have called the cops. The ""courtesy officer"" they say is available for any issues after hours is a joke.  My neighbors and I all were outside on our patios one night and there was a group of drunks at the pool (there are always drunks at the pool), but this was after it was closed.  The new fence they just added locks, but before that anyone could go in. These people were blasting music and yelling profanity. I volunteered to call and the courtesy officer told me he checked the pool to make sure it was closed.  I told him there were people there. He said to send the office an email and they could check the tapes to see who it was.  Seriously......????  I sent an email.  Never got a response.  My neighbors called the cops because it sounded like it was going to get violent.  In the year I have lived here, at least two neighbors called the cops for problems at the pool after calling the courtesy officer and getting no help.  We have all talked about how we can't wait for the pool to close.  None of us use it because of the problems.  I have seen cars pull up and let four teenagers out and then leave the neighborhood. I don't even think the people causing the problems live here because since school started back there is no one at the pool even on weekends.  I also had the cops show up at my door looking for someone who used to live here. When I voiced my complaints about the noise and problems at the pool to the office staff the ""manager"" told me I was the only one who had ever complained about any problems at the pool.  So, apparently, she is either a liar or in denial.  You can't even walk to and from your car in the summer without a lesson in profanity. One day I even had puke beside my car.  Also, the maintenance guys park their gold carts anywhere they want including behind cars and in the handicapped parking spaces.

"Have you ever been banned from a truck stop restroom? At first sight the place looked closed. After I had a closer look I realized there were just no customers. I thought great I can have the whole place to myself. After I walked in and saw every table was dirty and the old food in the floor I figured that was the reason i was the only customer. I hesitantly ordered a gyro plate even after I saw the visually repugnant warning photos of each plate scroll across the cheap and poorly mounted menu screen.

"Nice burger joint in The Mirage. 
The price is a bit steep for burgers and fries, but that's no surprise given the location.
Buddy and I actually opted for the exact same meal so can't delve much into variety, unfortunately.
The BCB (Bacon Cheese Burger).
A fatty patty (like an inch and a half thick!) on a nice soft roll, doused in a creamy, dense cheddar sauce that was more along the lines of a fondue (which was awesome) topped with some nice smoked bacon and french fried onion straws.
It was a delicious dish, indeed...and the integrity of the bun was not undone by the massively juicy burger or creamy cheesy goodness swimming around inside.
Bonus.
This place is à la carte (again, no surprise there) so sides come separate.
I saw onion rings, sweet potato fries and regular fries walk by while waiting to order, and they all looked like good options.
However, when the waitress told me that the curly fries come seasoned, I was sold.
The amount of fries in a serving is actually quite formidable, they are delivered in a silver cup like an old timey diner or new timey gastropub. At first glance it looks pretty chintzy, but pour that sucker out and your plate is swarmed. 
Easily enough to share.
The dining area is pretty wide open with a ton of big screen TV's spread amongst the walls.
As for the atmosphere, quite loud what with all the drunken Vegas roustabouts staggering by and the lack of a full partition between the tables and walkway.
All good though, makes for some great people watching.
The bill (after tip) came out to around $50 (I wanna say $15 each for the burgers $5 each for the fries and a couple bucks each for the soda).
So yeah, it's a little more expensive than the McPick 2 you can pick up across the street but that fast food can't even front.",0.0
"if people think this is a 4.5 establishment they were either drugged or they are from another planet. I like to think of myself as a Mexican food connoisseur. First thing is as im sitting here i feel sick to my stomach and slept in all afternoon because the food made me feel awful. OK so first up,the waitress there was nice but she was the only one there,when i first walked in the door there was not one employee in sight. I sat down and there was this obnoxious customer trying to engage me in multiple conversations i was polite but,dude when someone is looking down at their phone or looking at a menu and they are giving you short answers or ignoring you all together its probably time to piss off,he made me so uncomfortable i almost left. Next up the food..ok so naturally food that makes you sick is no bueno..but the other issue is the price..i didnt make the waitress suffer by not tipping her but this food is way over priced and over hyped ive had better food off a truck in Baja,with no tip and 10 times the food. My bill for a burrito and a coke was 19 +4 for the tip. there are places around town you could pay a third and have a superior experience all around. The sign outside the restaurant says ""MEXICAN BISTRO"" translation...get ready to eat some sup par food for an exorbitant amount of money. The last thing that was really annoying is they had no tooth picks this only added to the unpleasantness of the whole experience. Here's a tip for management if you think its fair to charge these prices then spend some money on some courtesy's like tooth picks. also,the bathroom is nicely done but seriously there should be a sign outside like the ones at the roller coasters stating ""people larger then THIS,should use the alley outside""..the bathroom is fine if you're a midget.",0.0

"I am not writing this review on the food at A Taste of Buffalo. I am reviewing the service. Why you ask? How can you review a restaurant with out tasting their food? Well..... We (a party of 4) arrived at 6pm. We finally had our orders taken at 6:39. 1 foot long, 1\/2 dozen wings and 1 beef on weck. I was told when I ordered it would take 20 mins for my food. The restaurant had a special gathering for Buffalo Bills Backers. At 7:09 I caught the eye of the food runner, held up our numbers. The runner came back and said you food will be right out. At 7:29 (50 MINUTES LATER) I went to the counter and said I would like a refund because I waited 50 mins and still did not get my food. The guy at the counter did not even check on my order... he just gave me a cash refund and said sorry.

Well...... I can't eat sorry.

 Mike Juliano how can run a hot dog stand and waste 1:30 hrs of my life. You see patrons sitting for 1.5 hrs with no food and you can't send out some chips,bread or frys gratis.
To sum up this review..... we went next door to Cucina Tagliani Italian Kitchen. At 7:35 we had drinks, bread and soup. At 7:50 we had our entrees. WOW a real restaurant",0.0
I just went to this location again and AGAIN there was barely any meat. I asked if they changed how much meat theyre putting on the sandwiches and they said yes because corporate got mad and now they're limited to only putting 2 oz of meat... AKA 2 lil slices of meat. If thats the case then corporate needs to lower their prices then too. No one wants to pay the same amount for less meat. They also should change their advertisements which show sandwiches full of meat to a sorry ass looking sandwich with mostly lettuce in it. I came home added more meat to my sandwich from the fridge today. Never going back there again. Quiznos can just go out of business now. They were my favorite sandwich place in the past but now i just don't care. Taking my business to Jersey Mikes from now on. Oh and thanks to your cool employees today you got extra stars from me because you really deserve negative 25 stars. Bye Quiznos!,0.0
"The Annex isn't exactly the type of place you'd normally find me. I like hole-in-the-wall bars, but this place is really more of a forgotten hideaway than a hidden gem. The atmosphere is dark, everything is old and outdated and it was cramped. 

It was also cramped because it was crowded, which means people love this place. There are some good reasons to- the bartenders and owner were really great. Fast service, good pours, friendly, and hospitable. The owner saw our large group and came over to set up a table for us right away.  The drinks were cheap and I like their monthly specials.

The thing that will get me back in the door is the food. My burger was really- I mean REALLY good. I didn't get any fries or sample any other food, but my compadres all enjoyed their food as well. Their burgers may be famous in that area and if you can check your hauteur at the door, you just might enjoy yourself!",0.0
"My very first experience with this office was the initial consultation I had with the owner. That was fine and I was optimistic about their cleaning rotation system. Unfortunately, I did not hear from the owner again for several weeks at which point he finally called and told me they had been booked solid until then and asked me if I was ready to schedule my first appointment. Remembering my initial optimism, I made the appointment. I had my home cleaned for a few months and was moderately satisfied each time. A couple months ago I had to put the cleaning service on hold for a while. (Nobody answered the phone when I called to pause services and nobody returned my call to ask about any issues or why I was canceling.) I was considering starting again when I received an emailed coupon from them. This was the incentive I needed to call and make a new appointment. Immediately, I was questioned about the coupon and whether or not I could use it. Not a good start. However, I was excited about a clean house so I finally used the coupon and left the ladies to it. When I got home, I saw that my floors were still dirty. There were literally still dog paw prints on the floor. I stepped on crumbs and other such debris. The overall impression was that my home was ""cleaner"" than it had been before they came, but it was certainly not CLEAN. Basically, it looked like I had cleaned it myself. If I was happy with my own abilities, I'd do it myself and save the $120. We will be using somebody else in the future.",0.0

Anyway.
Husband and I traveled to this part of town to come to NG the first week it opened. Since we had never been in this area we were excited to see what was up.
I myself having been to several NG in other states I was SUPER pumped and was explaining to my husband how the one in Dallas is set up.

We walk inside and he grumbles lol.

We specifically wanted to grab some vegan snacks and granola type mixes for his work trip to LA the next day...wow... Their own branded granola when the package was turned over looked like dust. Straight up crumbs. 

And!!!!! Allllll the chocolate featured items such as pretzels, trail mixes, blah blah of their own brand in the refrigerator section all have milk in them. Milk.

Anyway we decided on Purely Elizabeth granola and another cranberry orange mix from another company. I really would have liked to support NG but the crumbs, milk and not being organic issues are a complete turn off.

I do love that they carry organic pet foods and treats etc but the $2-5+ hike in price compared to Amazon is just really terrible. 

Their produce although all organic? was nothing to be excited about. It's a small, cramped and cluttered tiny area. It was busy and like eight people practically elbowing each other to get veggies is not my cup of tea.

"This is my second time buying a car from them. I had people advise me to go to Carmax but I felt comfortable with this family owned business. However, 20 days into my newly purchased vehicle, it breaks down and I find myself stranded with my son. Since I am still in warranty I call them and am treated very poorly. I'm told they have no idea when a tow will come. They tell me it will be today but not for awhile. I'm 8 months pregnant and, again, stranded with my 6 year old son. I tell them I was planning on finding a way home. I'm advised to just leave the key with the car. I don't even bother asking what happens if it gets stolen. I then ask how long they will have the car. The man says ""I don't know"". I ask if it could be days or weeks. He says ""Again, I don't know. I got 3 cars towed in just today."" Yes. 3 cars they sold towed in just today. Which makes mine the fourth. I ask him if they would refund any money spent on the vehicle to repair it if I didn't want to wait the possible weeks for them to get around to it. I literally get laughed at and am told ""If you want to spend money on the car no way am I giving you anything back."" 

I decided to write a review because clearly, they've started selling lemons. I say started because I believe there was a time when they were an honest company. Now, they sell broke down vehicles and treat you poorly when you call to tell them it broke down.

"If I could give negative stars I would. DON'T EVER PURCHASE A WARRANTY FROM SEARS. On 01\/12\/14 I purchased a 60 inch Samsung TV for $1299.99 from this SEARS location. They also conned me in to purchasing their 5 year extended warranty on my TV. The SEARS TV salesman convinced me to purchase their warranty over the Square Trade one I was going to purchase because how hassle free it would be to get a new TV if a very EXPENSIVE repair is ever needed in the future. The SEARS WARRANTY WAS $409.99 for 5 years of coverage. Like a sucker I bought it that day after how good the sales guy pitched it to me on it. Fast Forward 3 years to 12\/16\/16. I turn on my TV and 6 inches down from the top there is a very small black line the runs Horizontal across my whole 60 inch TV that won't go away no matter what input I use. So I call the Sears Service phone number on my Warranty paperwork. Three days later the repair guy shows up. In less then 2 minutes of looking at my TV he says your Panel is shot and needs to be replaced or you will continue to see the black horizontal line across your screen. He then proceeded to tell me if the Part\/Repair cost exceeded my ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE of $1299.99 that they would opt to REPLACE the TV instead of a repair attempt. Next the SEARS REPAIR MAN searches the NEW panel price and tells my girlfriend and I that it's $1390.00 !!!  Also tells us thats before including the $199.99 labor fee to the Repair man lol. So add the labor charge and the PART COST and you have $1589.99. So consider that my TV was $1299.99 BRAND NEW !!  So easy decision for SEARS to just replace my TV with a new one right ???  Absolutely not. They refuse and tell me that they are electing to order me a NEW PANEL and that I wait 2 WEEKS for them to come out and replace my panel. So I go into this PV MALL Sears location to speak with the Manager. Tell my story to younger assistant manager and she tells me that I need to speak with Mike ""the operations Manager"". So I tell Mike how SEARS is trying to screw me out of a new TV replacement after I purchased a $410.00  5 year Warranty. Mike takes my complaint and says he will escalate the matter to a corporate level and apologized that there wasn't more he could do for me. Said he would call me back within 2 days to resolve the matter. Guess what ?  2 days pass and the Manager Mike never even called me back. So I call SEARS corporate office my self to have someone explain to me why SEARS would choose to PAY $1589.99 TO REPAIR a broken TV instead of just giving me a REPLACEMENT. Fast Forward 45 min, now I'm on phone with the 3rd manager I had to go through with SEARS WARRANTY DEPARTMENT. Then they Finally admit to me that they aren't gonna pay $1589.99 to repair my TV because they got me a Refurbished Panel they ordered me for $650.00 and if I want them to do the repair I haft to Accept a used $650.00 panel they found or I'm stuck with my broken $1300.00 TV !!!  This is how they treated  me after spending $409.99 on their NO HASSLE EXCHANGE WARRANTY. Total fraud. I will never step foot in another SEARS as long as I live. I learned in the last week that the PANEL is the most expensive part in a TV to replace. So if SEARS will not give you a replacement TV when the most expensive part is broke. That means they will never just replace your TV ever. It's a total lie so FUTURE BUYERS BEWARE. I now know why SEARS is in BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS because they treat their customers like TRASH",0.0
"To be honest, the two stars are for the decor of the brewery and restaurant. Our experience there was fairly awful. We went on a Sunday around 5:30. It was very busy and we had to wait for a table, which was fine. They told us 15 and it ended up being closer to 30-35 minutes. We grabbed a beer at the bar and walked around until they had a table available. Once we finally got a table (one that had been empty for at least 15 minutes before they cleaned it) it took at least 15 minutes, maybe more, before anyone came to the table. We were about to get up and leave. The experience I've described so far is basically how the rest of our meal went. We saw our server a handful of times, the food was okay, and the beer was subpar. We had a two flights and tried every single one of their beers and were unfortunately none wowed us. A lot of them were pretty good, but just had no wow factor.

This restaurant is not what it used to be.  The staff and Chef are very friendly and the atmosphere is nice however the service and quality of food has gone down hill.  Took 30-40 minutes to bring out the appetizers.  Sitting there eating way too much bread.  The mushrooms were soggy and stuffed w bread crumbs?  Mushy and bland.  The muscles were half empty and my steak tasted like meatloaf.  The Chef did accommodate us but the food was not good.  Not for the price.

Worst customer service ever. Horrible dealership with shady car salesman who waste your time.... first of they had a 2014 Honda pilot that sat on there lots for 120 days clearly there not gonna sell it at the sticker price. So I had my girlfriend go do there to by her self to test drive it. Not only we're they trying to be pushy but they we're trying to make a deal with out me even there and just trying to get my girlfriend to be stupid enough to sign on a deal that was more then the sticker price of the vechile. So I told them we would be more then happy to purchase the vechile at 24 k for a counter offer. The deal refused and sent my girl friend home with some figures for me and as claimed at auction they would get 26 for the vechile. Keep in mind any one with a Brain in there skull know you will not get anything close to what they we're selling it for at auction. They be lucky to get 20 k Max. The next morning they contacted us back to tell my girlfriend some garbage story about how they were gonna give us the deal we wanted to only have my girlfriend and her father now go down there to jerk them around some and have a deal on the table that was even more then there original offer to us! Mind you this car was going to auction the day we called and also I have in hand 5 grand for a down payment and a vechile to trade in.

"This 1-star review is heartbreaking for me, because I had a 5-star experience there the night before. My friend and I are both from out of town and we had a wonderful evening there, served by a very lovely and attentive female server. We convinced the other girls from our business meeting (many also from out of town) to go, and we were served by Jeff, who, from the get-go, treated us completely differently from Angelene the night before (I'm SO sorry for this review, Angelene). He was condescending (kept speaking over us), and he even rolled his eyes when one of our girls complained that her guacamole was way too spicy and asked for a re-do. (Sorry, but when something is too spicy, people can't just swallow it down even if they want to.) 

The other girls were already making comments that he was coming across rude, but I didn't feel it until the end of the night when he asked us how we were all doing. I said, ""I think we're ready for the check,"" and he replied dismissively, ""I'm asking everybody."" I'm sorry, Jeff, but I didn't realize that I wasn't part of the ""everybody."" There was then an awful miscommunication over a guacamole charge because we were all on separate bills. I get it; it's confusing and really annoying to gather separate bills. I get it; it's not ideal and it's extra work. But what I didn't get was the combative attitude and the condescending tone from both Jeff and the manager (who kept hovering over our table in the most uncomfortable manner at the beginning of our meal) who kept demanding to know ""then where's the fourth guacamole supposed to go?"" Every time we tried to explain, we got cut off (by both of them) with ""I get it"" when they clearly didn't. There wasn't a single apology for the mix up, and our gal was so over it that she had to ask three times to just give her the check to pay for it. Another one of our ladies even had to jump in a fourth time to ask for it just to end the debacle.

What blew the lid off me was that Jeff overheard (or one of his coworkers did) one of our girls say ""no tip!"" and he came out and handed us a tirade, yelling at us, ""Just to let you know, it's really not cool to leave no tip over a guacamole and that it's not fair to not tip people who work their asses off for you."" Guess what? We know. He was serving a table of people who work in service --many of whom were business owners-- and we live off of tips and the generosity of our clients, as well. 

Note to Jeff: I was actually going to leave you a tip so that you had something to tip your busser, your bartender, and the lovely gentleman who made the tableside guacamole with. But when you decided to go off on our ENTIRE table based off of your eavesdropping of what ONE person said, I was done, and I, too, for the first time in seventeen years, didn't leave a tip either. (Sept of '99 was the last time I didn't tip.) The server was livid--I get it, but we could feel the passive aggressive condescension from the beginning, and hopefully that sheds light on our building frustration throughout the night. 

Jeff asked a good question: All this for $6? Maybe The Mission, its manager, and its servers should ask themselves the same question--was it worth quibbling over $6 when you probably made $400+ at a table of 8? I've never experienced service like this. I'm sorry if your server was having a bad day, but we all saw him roll his eyes at us at the beginning of the night. We all heard every time he talked over us. And you don't dismiss a customer with ""I'm asking every one"" when she asks for the check. And when you get the bill wrong, even if it's not (you think) your fault, just say you're sorry and try to understand the situation instead of getting accusatory. We didn't even get an apology when we brought up the incorrect billing from any of the 3 people who interacted with us over it. Like I said, just a lot of getting cut off with ""I get it, but..."" 

Honestly, we were all set to have a good time, but I think that he decided ahead of time that we were going to be annoying and going to cause trouble, and by acting from that set of expectations, he actually created the situation. I wish he gave us a chance, because we certainly gave him many throughout the night. And if he's still hurt about not getting a tip from me (which I hope I don't have to do ever again), it came in the form of my silence from not ripping you a new one after you ripped into us over what ONE person said.

The food is great, and the cocktails, though pricy, were tasty. I had an amazing experience being served by female servers for a small party. With parents in the restaurant industry, friends and clients in the restaurant industry, and myself working in service, I am the furthest thing from the most demanding client, but any customer can seem demanding when they won't meet you halfway and listen. We told them exactly how to split the bill, but it's hard to be clear when you get cut off with ""I get it, but..."" every time you try.",0.0

"Coffee to me isn't just a drink it's a lifestyle. Regrettably, this insignificant Starbuck's inside of Macy's is the exclusive coffee house to satisfy the coffee lovers lifestyle in Downtown Summerlin 

   Oftentimes but not every time, I frequent Downtown Summerlin, it is after an exhausting hike in the open spaces contiguous to Las Vegas. My first stop is to walk inside of Macy's to make a beeline for the Starbuck's by the east entrance. 

   Frequently this Starbuck's has a line of people. It is obvious that the demand exceeds the supply. There are only a few tables that fill up and limited space to move around the diminutive room. You would think that a regional shopping destination would have an inviting cafe with a sundry and variety of seating including outdoor seating. You wouldn't think that the sole coffee house would be one of the tiniest in the City of Las Vegas. The upshot is that I usually buy the cup of coffee to go where I will savour it outside at the water feature or by the arroyo park. 

   When coffee is not just a drink but a lifestyle, you don't mind paying inexorbitant prices for it. This location is not off the charts highly priced like some of the Las Vegas Strip locations but it is more than the average Starbuck's owned locations. This Macy's owned Starbuck's does  charge 27 cents over and above for drip coffee. 

  Ultimately when coffee is a lifestyle, you do things like review it on Yelp. The only discouraging thing is that  the only coffee house we can currently review in Downtown Summerlin is this pocket-size Starbuck's inside the men's department of Macy's.",0.0
"First off, I would agree with every review on this site for this practice. I came to Vista Medical Group following my PCP, Dr. Edmund, from her own practice when she joined up earlier this year. Upon my first visit about 4 months ago, I was told that I needed to fill out new patient paperwork at my first visit. This was not a problem, but the massive attitude from the staff was a problem. They were extremely nasty to me when I asked why, since I was not a new patient to Dr. Edmund, that I had to fill out new paperwork. They scowled at me that I was a new patient ""to them"" and they needed it filled out right now.

Then, trying to get anyone from this office on the phone is impossible. We would call to schedule a follow-up and no one would answer the scheduling line. At any time during the day. Trying to get some test results is equally impossible. I truly believe that they don't ever check messages, because they won't acknowledge them. That's if you are able to leave a message, half of the time when you call at 2:00 pm, their phones are turned off. And don't even try to get a hold of someone after-hours with their on-call service. The messages will not be returned, you will be left in limbo.

My husband and I tried to call to ask simple questions to the doctor\/assistants or staff. We called on a daily basis for almost three weeks with absolutely no response from anyone in the office. We were at the end of our rope when we received an email from our doctor here, stating that she QUIT. We were trying for 3 weeks to contact her in vain, no one even bothered to contact us to tell us she wasn't there anymore. To any of Dr. Edmund's patients, or any patient of this practice, did you guys receive the email? The office staff seems to think she's just taking a leave of absence, but the email pretty plainly said she quit. I wonder if the staff had anything to do with that?",0.0
"First time here and was excited as I was told this was a lovely place. Was also told to come super early on a Sunday morning. (Before 11am for half price dim sum NOTE: CASH ONLY). 

The two of us arrived here at 10:15 and were called to sit down at 10:55. By the time the waitress got to the table she clocked us in at 11:05, even though we kindly mentioned we were here before 11am.She just smiled and walked away.  (Why they don't clock people in when they first arrive is beyond me.). Ok. Move on ... As you know that was not a good indication we would get the selection of half price dim sum. To be honest, the majority of our food selection were not part of the half price dim sum anyways. No half price shrimp har gow .. Or the better quality ribs .. Etc , Basically only the cheaper choices. Even the deep fried shrimp although lovely to look at was mostly pastry and three small shrimps inside. All in all we had a variety of food ... And from my experience I've had much better. Actually one of my all time favourite places for dim sum is in china town, Victoria, Vancouver .. Sigh .. But that's for another time :) I would rate the food at average, perhaps a notch below from other dim sum restaurants I've been to. 

Anywho .. 1 1\/2 later, with a 75.00 bill and a mind frame of ""let's just move on"", we paid with credit card as the waitress was standing there. After entering the sum, the waitress had the audacity to mention there was no tip on the credit card. ""Of course not, as we prefer to leave cash tips for waitress. "". I couldn't believe what I was hearing, I have never in my entire life been to a restaurant and had this happen. BY THE WAY  : Tips are a curtesy for amazing service, not a necessity in the first place. Anyways my partner, being ever gallant as always and a proper gentleman, mentioned we tip in cash, and she stood there the whole time waiting for him to put it down. OMG !!! it took every ounce of myself to not shove a dim sum in her gob LOL.  Talk about classy .. Horrible experience all around. Poor job in the establishment teaching their hostess. 
On another better note : 
The banquet hall itself however is quite lovely. What you would expect from a large ballroom, complete with a stage. The dinner ware however was shabby and needed up keeping. (Hey I tried keeping it a better note, but one can't hide from the truth ;) ).  

I would definitely recommend moving on .. There are by far better quality Asian dim sum food elsewhere, with much lovelier staff better trained on customer etiquette. There was only one waitress who worked on our side that was so sweet and smiling. Every other poor soul looked as if it was their last day on earth.",0.0
"It started out really bad.  After checking in with the hostess, we're told about 10 mins wait and was asked to wait behind the counter.  Twenty-five minutes had passed and as we look around everyone that was waiting before us, including those that came after us, were seated except our party. It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him. So, I finally asked  how much longer do we need to wait before we get seated.  Much to our surprise, they couldn't find our ticket.  My wife and I were furious at that point.  Glad we had Alicia as our server.  She asked how our day was and we told her what just happened.  Apparently, she told another manager,Greg, what happened. Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one..... Kudos to Alicia who was very attentive and gave us 5 star service.",0.0

I took two bites and sent it back. My wife had the special Parmesan crusted tilapia the fish was soggy and the pasta greasy and bland.

Lee, the employee who redid my nails because my polish was chipping off after 2 days was incredibly irritated that I even came back to have them redone.

More upsetting was the first time I went the owners husband was asking me for my credit card moments after I picked out the color since he was going to be leaving and apparently no one knew how to run the machine. I asked if I could wait to have my credit card ran until after my nails were done and he laughed and said ""why you aren't paying if they look bad"" I will never return to this place, especially because this is how they treat most customers. One customers asked if they had availability for an appointment and the owner said yes, the lady said I am going to grab something to eat and will return a little later and the entire staff laughed as soon as she walked out the door and started talking about the women and how ""she just cheap"" so sad and so disappointing!",0.0
"What a disappointment!!! I love Guy's shows on food network and I expected a higher level of excellence from one of his restaurants.  I ordered the Vegas fries and after waiting for about 25 minutes they came out ice cold, soggy and with barely a hint of blue cheese crumbles.  My son had the mac n cheese burger which was pretty good but the fries he got had so much seasoning that they looked like the seasoning bottle was dropped on them and most were inedible. The sweet iced tea tasted like the swiss sweet tea you buy by the gallon for 2.99.  My husband had the wings which were ok but nothing special i can make much better at home but the celery they brought with them looked like the pcs that you throw away before chopping, the leafy yellow soft part, when he complained the waitress said they come pre-made.  That left us perplexed.   To top off the evening the waitress spilled blue cheese dressing all over my sons pants.

"My daughter and I dropped in Dots and Doodles one afternoon and it was a chilly reception. Not just because it was a winter day in 2016, but we were greeted with not a smile nor friendly ""hello!"", nor a quick, ""Ladies, is this your first time here?"". Because if the employees asked this of us my elementary school-aged daughter and I would have said a yes. I yearned for instruction.

This is unfortunate, too. I felt like we were bothering them for wanting to paint something and give them our money. We were not properly informed of what to touch and what not to touch in the room. 

My daughter was spoken to in a firm way -- I won't say scolded, but here, I wrote it...when she painted her canvas mostly white and the helper was miffed that we did not know (not told.

"I was unaware that this was a vegetarian place but nonetheless took a shot at the ""spicy pinto"" burrito. I didn't take a combo\/trio and I didn't take a drink either.

The beans and cheese on one side of the burrito, vegetables on the other side and a whole bunch of rice in the middle... And yet the only side I found myself eating was the vegetable side because I found the beans\/cheese\/rice mix to be too heavy and dry. I wish it would have had more salsa or some guacamole. A positive is that it was actually spicy, which I enjoyed.

1) Enchiladas in Chili Verde - This one is awesome! The chicken is flavorful and the green sauce is excellent with great kick.. not too spicy but just right. We all loved this one!
2) Enchiladas in Mole sauce - I thought this one was great too. The hint of sweetness with the combination of different spices sure made the enchilada great. My son and I loved it but my husband is not a fan.
3) Pozole - This is good as well but wouldn't say it's the best I've had. I did enjoy the flavor of the broth but wasn't a big fan of the chicken because it was a little tough and dry.
4) Carne Asada Torta - My husband did not like this one at all. He said it was bland and the meat was dry and no flavor... will not be ordering this for sure in the future.
5) Quesadilla Arabe - Both my son and husband thinks this was bland as well. Nothing special and will not be ordering this in the future as well.
6) Esquites - Elote in a cup.. this was alright.  I was a little disappointed on this as I was really hoping that this will be good coz I love elote. The lime and cotija cheese was overpowering everything.  I can't barely taste the corn and the mayo due to the sour taste from the lime and salty taste of the cotija cheese.  I will not be ordering this again.

My order: Tonkatsu shio black (Small) + Ginger Ale 

Total: more or less $18+ (with tax and tip)

Pros: 
- Ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy 
- Tonkatsu shio black oil soup base was just OK 
- The servers were very nice and polite. Took down our order right away and smiled as well.  Very kind service.

Cons:
-  Stuffing that they include in the soup are pretty much nothing. You have to pay for everything.  So basically your paying for soup, noodles and 1pc of thin meat.
-  Would be nice if they added more green onions, bean sprouts, etc as free stuffings to begin with and then charge extra for more. Because the bowl literally had nothing in it except for soup, noodles and 1 meat.
-  Pricy for the size you get even as a small bowl. Been to better ones then this downtown.
-  Pricy for students. Poor students! Lol

However, after trying to SELL to the store I was disappointed. My boyfriend came in and brought a tub of stuff and a male manager helped us and it went great we were so happy. That great experience made me want to bring down some of my clothes. I brought down a couple bags of brand name stuff that I had hardly ever worn, which is exactly what they advertise they buy. Out of two bags of hardly worn, brand name clothing, the young girl(who I think was probably new) said that the only thing they were interested in buying was 1 scarf. I was so disappointed, and I was planning on buying some stuff from them while I was waiting but I was just so disappointed that I left empty handed.",0.0

The only person professional and helpful in that office is Kim. Jaime and Susan are both rude and no help at all. The tone of voice they both choose to use sounds like you're interrupting them and they'd prefer not to be asked questions. They took my application fee and told me it would take three days to hear something back but my call was never returned and to me that isn't how you do business. I've monitored the sight for days and it seems as though the prices on the home increase every other day. It's a nice complex but they need rent control and more employees like Kim.,0.0

Definitely  NOT one of the better poolside services.

Nachos with chili= $20.00. The only item worth eating, a huge portion, and not bad at all. Chips, cheese sauce, and toppings all spot on. easily 2 people can share this and call it a meal.
""Warm"" big pretzel with cheese sauce= $6.00. Tastes like it came from the ass-crack of a homeless Bavarian, fucking disgusting. Stale, borderline hard, gross. I dont think even a homeless person would eat this, wow.
Chicken tenders= $13.00 Garbage. comes straight from the freezer, jack in the box tastes better, and the waffle fries limp and lukewarm, inconsistently seasoned (some parts to death some not at all) . Only thing tender is my ass after the price\/butt-rapeage.
1 powerade, a fucking coke, 6.00 each.
Pineapple mojito finished in 3 sips filled with 60% ice, $14.00. Tasty but gone b4 you know it.
Come to the pool with McDonalds bags as half the ghetto bastard crowd does (not that a casino food court is a bargain either.)

"Whoever this new assistant manager or whatever she is really needs to go. I had a few items from the dollar bins section and a couple didn't have a tag. The young cashier who was obviously kinda new working there said she had to go find the price on those two items. I told her to look in the dollar bins section where I got them. She took almost 10 minutes as a line is building behind me. She comes back and says she can't find it. She asks the assistant mgr for help. Then she goes looking for it. Once again I tell her it's in the dollar bins section. Another almost 10 minutes now and she returns and says she can't find it either. Yeah, I could have walked to the aisle and showed them since they are both useless employees but by this time everyone behind me is pretty annoyed waiting in line.

"this might be a little long and I ask you to read the whole review to understand why im writing this.
because this is the absolute worst man and owner I have ever dealt with.
first I want to say he did remove 6 trees.
but in our conversation before he started on removing trees... we agreed to a price which I thought was fair.
and he will disagree with this but the agreement was to remove all 6 trees and clean up the mess from those trees. 
there were two on the side of the house and 4 in the back wrapped around our pool.
scott and his helper started on the side first and every once in a while I would go out to see how everything was going and to see if they needed something to drink or anything else ..after i went back inside the house then I started hearing the logs he was cutting and  dropping from anywhere from 10 ft. to 30 ft.and hitting the wall I just painted and marring them.
and the logs he was dropping on our bushes.
so when he was getting ready to start in the backyard around our pool I asked him if he wanted to use our pool cover to cover the ground and pool so it wouldn't make a mess. and he said don't worry about it it will be o.k.
so needless to say he dropped a big log into the pool and didn't take it out til I asked  him to.
and  then he started to get an attitude with me... saying I was watching  him like a hawk...and it bothered him..he also said I abused him
yes I was watching he was dropping the logs from 30 feet in the air to the ground breaking our bricks...tree  shavings were all through the pool... so I thought he would clean it up at the end when he was done..
he finished around 8;30pm and it was dark so I couldn't tell how good they cleaned the yard til I had time
when I had time I realized in total
1...he damaged our bushes on the side of the house 3 of them
2...he marred 4 different walls
3... he left a complete mess in the pool
4...he damaged our drip system around the trees he ground up which I still have had no time to repair..
5... he still has not come back to finish the one stump that he didn't finish grinding
and I cleaned up 7 trash bags full of tree shavings that he didn't pick up.
when I told him about the marred walls and the brick he told me
Ooo so you cant go down and buy a $3.00 brick yourself and you cant pull out a paint brush and paint it yourself..so I got upset with him on the phone and he hung up on me 
he now refuses to answer his phone or texts I sent him....im  just asking for him to just fix what he damaged.
if I could post pictures on here I would show them but  I cant
his attitude is horrible and as a businessman he is responsible for such damages he inflicks on someones property...
and as for is A-plus rating with the b.b.b it is false because a business has to register  with the b.b.b to get a real rating.
and  only the  owner can register
and he has not done that
you can look it up yourself
if you want pictures I will gladly show them to you.... just email me at fransenguy@yahoo.com
I would love to show the damage and mess he left me
I will be filing a formal complaint with the b.b.b . and yes they will take complaints about a business even though that are not registered with them.

"The worst salon experience of my LIFE. I had long dark hair that I had been dying burgundy at home. I wanted to try blonde for the first time. I had a consultation appointment with Elizabeth - the purpose of this was so she & I would be on the same page. I wanted to gradually lighten my hair and start by using color remover first before any bleach. She said sure, no problem, the first visit would take about 2.5 hours. She came across as extremely rude, stuck up, & not friendly at all. I gave her the benefit of the doubt & I completely regret it.

The first visit took almost SEVEN hours, not 2.5. She didn't care about what I wanted and put like 10 lbs of foil in my hair even though I NEVER SAID I WANTED HIGHLIGHTS & the reference photo I showed her had ZERO highlights. I trusted her, I thought, ""maybe this was just how you get hair blonde."" NOPE. Because she used foils instead of painting the product directly on the hair, the right side of my head had bleach on it for about 45 minutes longer than the left side of my head!

The end result? My hair was about 20 different colors! I had some parts almost white, some parts ORANGE, some parts brown, others almost black. It looked HORRIBLE. It looked like what someone would do at home and go into a salon asking them to fix!

I have no idea what her problem was, but she made my hair look AWFUL. I felt sick to my stomach when I saw my hair, and the worst part? She left about 1-2 inches of my naturally BLACK roots! WHY???

She tried to fix the mistake by doing MORE foils and MORE bleach, and over processed my hair, causing lasting damage. She was extremely rough with my head and scalp, yanking & pulling my head, snapping off hair, and even though NO BLEACH TOUCHED MY SCALP, my head was extremely sore for 3 days afterwards!

I felt horrible. I went there to look prettier. Instead, I left with the UGLIEST hair of my entire life. I told her I wanted to GRADUALLY lighten my hair, & I expected to have a light brown after the first session. I did NOT expect to have 20 different ugly colors in my hair. I cried all that night and was so embarrassed I wouldn't leave the house without a hat.

Elizabeth has been there for almost 20 years so I THOUGHT she would be good at her job. She's either incompetent or she ruined my hair on purpose.

I had to go to a different salon in Squirrel Hill and pay them 500+ dollars to fix what ELIZABETH did. She damaged my hair so badly I ended up having 8 inches cut off. I grew my hair out for 2 years before this, and it is really upsetting to lose 8 inches off my hair just because of her mistake.

The only good thing is that they refunded my money, but really I feel like they should have paid to have it fixed since they're responsible for the damage in the first place!

The owner of the second salon I went to made my hair pretty again. It is now a beautiful blonde, but really short, & the only real damage done to my hair was caused by the HIGHLIGHTS that ELIZABETH did. I 100% regret going to La Pomp. La Pomp is HORRIBLE, AWFUL.

"Has potential, but this new restaurant would benefit from some customer comment cards in the store. Butter chicken was dry and sauce was standard. The roti was dry too and too hot when served, made me think it has been heated in a microwave (I don't actually know if it had been). When it cooled it was crispy and rigid, not what I would expect from a roti. Price was reasonable and service was friendly but would hesitate going back until the food improved.",0.0

"Negative 10 billion stars...at least!  Never ever ever rent from this understaffed pathetic miserable sorry excuse for a car rental agency. It appears that to gain employment here, you must have had a Lobotomy, and after said Lobotomy you must have an I.Q lower than a turnip. You  then qualify to be employed at this god awful sheethole of an alleged rental agency. I know, I just insulted all the turnips out there. Sorry. But I digress...we arrived on a Saturday morning, took the airport shuttle to the rental car center and waited. And then one of their shuttle buses appeared. Yay! Nah, no yay. The dozens of others stampeded the shuttle and we were left waiting, and waiting for the next shuttle. When it did arrive, it took us on a 20 minute journey to a ramshackle building in a questionable part of town. Eeww. So, we got off and stood in line..........and waited.........and waited..........and waited.........and waited. Apparently the Lobotomized employees take 15-25 minutes per person to get them a car. I guess that's what a Lobotomy does to you. So, after an hour+ waiting in line, I get to the counter with License and contract in hand and very l loudly state that I DO NOT WANT ANY INSURANCE OR ANY EXTRAS!!!!!!.......Sigh, falls on deaf ears. The zombie behind the counter proceeds to do his schpeel on insurance. I flatly tell him NO! He then goes on a rant about the weather, rain, and oil on the road.

"Had a strong hankering for prime rib. Was staying at the Aliante Hotel Casino Resort and thought why not try their signature steakhouse.  Upon walking in you are surrounded by a spectacular oval bar with shimmering glass, a huge wine bottle display, high vaulted ceilings, staff dressed to the nines. Seating area is dark browns with lots of tans and ivory, steakhouse vibe for sure.  My meal started off with warm pretzel sticks and whipped butter, nice opening round.  I kept it simple, ordered the perfectly seasoned prime rib dressed with au jus gravy and horseradish.  The steak was juicy, succulent and melted in my mouth.  The wheels came off the bus somewhat during my sides of macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach.  While their tastes were steakhouse quality and yummy, they were served to me almost cold, I sent them back for a reheat.  They were better when returned, but the head chef can't let that happen for this quality of restaurant.  And speaking of that, why have we in America gotten too casual.  This is a fine dining establishment, with 5 star service, and yet the majority of diners were in casual shorts, hoodies, and sweat pants, it's a disgrace.  Europeans would be appalled. Now that my rant is over I finished my meal with a proper creme brûlée that was creamy, sweet and dressed with fresh fruit, a very appropriate ending to an excellent meal. Some final thoughts to the MKRT team, heat your serving plates and tell me be careful, your plate is very hot.  Offer me some melted butter to dip my steak in, and serve that au jus gravy boiling hot, not lukewarm.  If there are temperature issues, served the food covered before presentation.  The steak should also extremely hot when first served, think Ruth Chris hot.  So with all that said, I loved the vibe of this place, it's very close to going to a higher level.",0.0
"We made an appointment (Feb) to try on dresses since I was a little lost on what I wanted \/ where to go and this was my starting point. I was asked for my budget, wanted to look around since wedding was still quite some time away so I wasn't sure what the budget would be, gave budget (what I thought it would maybe be?) - loved some of the dresses and the attendant kept saying, well... that's out of your budget. Ok, I get it - don't get my hopes up but come on, most brides end up spending way more than they planned so at least play along.  I wanted to try on a couple of the ""out of my budget"" dresses and the attendant just skirted the request and would walk off and find other things.  I think she was also pretty turned off because of my estimated budget so I'm assuming these people are paid on commission? I tried on 4 dresses and was told they would be closing so yeah... Guess i needed to hurry up. Needless to say I didn't ring the bell, felt completely deflated and really turned off by this place. I dreaded actually going to another appointment since this was my first impression of trying dresses on.  David's bridal is GREAT for cheap bridesmaids dresses as long as you buy them online.  They're great as long as you don't tell them you have a budget and even greater if you tell them you have 15 bridesmaids instead of one...   Extended Rant Alert: Great news though! I went to another place and because of how horrible this experience was here the other place stepped it up and made it a great experience so I wouldn't have to go home and feel depressed for not wanting a princess gown and 15 pink bridesmaid dresses.

The food was good, but not what I expected. I ordered the salmon, which was a tad overcooked. It also comes on top of soup (yep, weird) and has a salad on top of that.

"Living here was definitely a challenge for us considering we had an apartment with no patio- never lived anywhere without a patio. There were pros and cons just as any other apartment living. That extra $50 for cable was worthless. I paid less for Directv and had ten times more features than the cox they force you to get. We really didn't want cable because we were saving to buy a house and had our Directv account suspended. And spending $50 for something we could watch online was a waste. (We couldn't order Directv)  Maintenance was ok on top of things. 

Upon moving in, the place smelt like cat urine so we cleaned it with some deep cleaning solution and shampooed the carpets. Had to purchase two  allergy filters because whoever lived there prior had a cat and my partner is allergic to cats. We didn't want have them come back into our apartment to clean up with boxes being everywhere. We don't trust anyone in our place without us being there. So we would have had to be home for them to clean and our work schedules were hectic. The neighbor downstairs played a REAL PIANO everyday!!!! Called the office SEVERAL times and we just got tired of calling and nothing was being solved. The cops were even called. We were nice enough to stay there. By LAW we could have easily broke our lease, for those who don't know you can do that because the office knows about it and nothing was done. There was no peace living with that downstairs neighbor!! Even banging on the floor would only help sometimes. 
Upon moving out, we received a bill for over a thousand dollars to be paid within 15 days!! When  we left we cleaned that apartment & had the carpets professionally cleaned. It was ready for someone to move in. They said the carpet had damage and had to be replaced. Which we found odd considering there were three areas where the carpet was sliced and replaced with a new or used piece. There was even a piece where it didn't match, but it didn't matter to us because we had the fish tank covering it. 

The staff is nice. They gym came in handy when I didn't want to take a drive to LVAC. There was a supply of water and towels, most of the time. The pool area is beautiful. 

The best tip I can give you: make sure when you move you have enough money for your place you're moving to and the place you just moved out. If they want they will give you less than 30 days to pay for new carpet so the next person who moves in can benefit off what you just paid for. We would have liked to pay for new carpet before we moved it because that carpet had so much damage to it already and now I'm meeting with my lawyer to see what can be done because this is just wrong. We see why there wasn't a deposit. They are going to take it anyways and overcharge you after you move out. I will be meeting with them to find out how to resolve this. I would have given it 5 stars but that unnecessary bill just brought it down.

"I stopped into Tan Izakaya for lunch and was heartened to hear a proper ""irrashaimase!"" from the owner Mike Chen.  

Great location and ambiance and I sat at the bar to order and to enjoy lunch.  

Overall, it was a good experience but it was uneven to be sure.  I found it is newly opened so there are bound to be kinks to work out.

I ordered the miso soup, omurice and a selection of yakitori as well as kikusui saké. 

The omurice was good - the filling was perfect but the topping of ketchup (which is normal) and mayonnaise and aonori (which is not) was interesting.  I prefer my omurice with ketchup only and the addition of mayonnaise and aonori was not bad but I didn't care for the combo.

The yakitori I had was the quail egg and bacon, the beef and asparagus, the shishito peppers and pork and green onion.  The meat (beef, pork) was cooked well except the bacon which was soggy and a bit greasy.  The shishito peppers were charred but had no salt or seasoning of any kind and so were flavorless.

The tare or glaze\/sauce for the meat was shiny and pretty but also lacking in flavor.

I am half-Japanese and go to Japan yearly and cook a lot of Japanese food so I am very familiar with yakitori etc., the tare or sauce for yakitori is paramount and Tan Izakaya's tare is not up to par.

The good:  

Service was good, nice variety of sakés and the menu looks good with a variety of items.

The bad:

Staff loudly discussing customer issues in earshot of diners - no customer wants to hear disparaging talk about ignorant customers regardless of the validity of the issues.  I agreed with what the staff were saying about ignorant customers but to hear it through 75% of my meal was not pleasant.

"We had to move out of state and needed to rent our home out for a bit. We decided on On Q Property Management after interviewing a few. We got off to a rocky start with their maintenance company, but they did resolve all issues (after many upset phone calls from me), but regardless, it got corrected. Fortunately I have family near by who was keeping an eye on things until it was rented out. 

We were pleased that they found, what we were told, were qualified tenants quickly. The rental person claimed they had no children except for an exchange student who would only be there for a month (not an issue, we didn't ask if they had kids since it was a 5 bedroom house and expected a family to live there. This information was offered). 

Everything went along ok for the most part. The time came that we were ready to sell our home. We got real estate agents. They needed to go over to the house and check it out, take pictures, etc. We contacted the tenants directly and told them what was happening. We also floated the idea of them buying it if they were interested. 

Well, to make a long story short, our realtors found out that the tenants had credit issues and could not buy the house and they had children. (Again, not an issue, but we were told differently, which was the issue). So, in essence we were lied to by On Q. They had no reason to lie to us. It certainly wasn't the tenants fault that they lied. We understood the tenants' credit issues. We had been in the same boat 5 years before. That really upset us that they lied. We were very fortunate that they were good tenants, paid on time, kept the home in reasonable condition. 

So, now the tenants move and its time to finish our business with On Q. That took FOREVER or what felt like it anyway. We tried to email and call our property manager, Rebeccah. She wouldn't get back to us in a timely fashion. She never did end up returning my husband's calls to this day. When she would email back, it must have been right as she was walking out the door for the day because it was 9 PM east coast time, which is where we live and we couldn't reach her after that to respond. I called over there and ended up talking to their accounting department, who was very professional, unlike our property manager. 

Our microwave came up missing. Rebeccah did call the tenants about that. Again, I have family that was keeping an eye on the place. They first claimed there was no microwave (not true, had pictures). They finally after 3 weeks (no thanks to Rebeccah) returned a microwave that was clearly not ours. From the pictures I was sent it was filthy, still had food in it, YUCK. I immediately told her to get that filthy thing out of my house and give it back. 

Also, supposedly the tenants furnished a receipt that they had the house cleaned and the carpets cleaned, which Rebeccaah put in her report to. There was NO WAY the carpets had been cleaned as per the lease. Instead of Rebeccah maybe telling the tenants this (if I paid for work that wasn't done, I'd certainly call the company that was supposed to do it!), she let it go. This was clearly in the lease that carpets were to be professionally cleaned upon move out!!!! I ended up flying out there to see what the heck was going on with our home. Found that the carpets were barely vacuumed or vacuumed with a broken vacuum. As I vacuumed them, I found clothing tags and the little plastic thing that connects the tag to the cloth, even old food. Trim was missing from the garage door into the house (what was that about?????) Fortunately that appeared to be the only big issues.

I had a family member pick up all the keys (or so I thought). Next thing I know, my real estate agent says there is still a lock box from On Q on my property! Seriously????? I told Rebeccah to get the lock box out of there by the end of the business day the next day. There was no reason for that lock box to be there. They had no right to be in my house at that point!!!! Next thing I know, they never returned the POS microwave that the tenants returned and had to get it back. Was this woman kidding???? I was livid by that point. I told her to take the cost of our microwave out of their security deposit (receipt was sent to her for that microwave) since it was about a month later and to CLOSE MY ACCOUNT. 

Supposedly there was some miscommunication. Regardless, there was no need from ANYONE from that company to be inside of my house by that point. Beings that their maintenance department literally broke into my house in the beginning of our contract, we were furious with them. I would not recommend them, or at least not Rebeccah to be your property manager. The other staff that I had dealt with were pleasant and friendly. But these people lied to us, then wouldn't talk to us, had an unauthorized lock box on our house after my family picked up all the keys!!!

Few more fries in, I noticed it was bathing in, what my server confirmed, was a large puddle of grease.

"Originally we went in due to a positive yelp rating. Went for lunch on a Sunday. Both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed. Here is the story:

Downtown Scottsdale was super busy. There was hardly anywhere to park, yet we were the only ones in this place. We both felt uneasy walking in when we saw the place was empty, but decided to take the risk. 

The place looks cool, and it might be fine for drinks at night. It has a New Orleans feel to it. However, the server was more focused on keeping the empty, already clean bar pristine than anything else. We had to initiate the greeting after waiting about a minute for her attention. During our stay another couple walked in, hung around for 30 seconds and left because no one acknowledged them. 

There didn't seem to be any pride in the food. While the menu seemed okay, and the food appeared modern in its plating the taste was very bland. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. The veggies were definitely not sourced well, because they had nearly no flavor.

Shame on us for going into an empty place. We drove home feeling like we missed an opportunity. My guess is that this place has some investors, but no investment in a chef.

"My first time eating at Zupas was absolutely ridiculous. I finally have time to eat after coming off of 24 hour hospital shift and was starving and needing coffee. First of all - no coffee! What kind of ""cafe"" doesn't have coffee? I ordered a pulled pork sandwich because I am a sucker for BBQ. Someone makes the sandwich in 2 minutes and I am left standing in line for 10 more minutes before I can pay, by this time the sandwich was cold. My meat was not hot and the bun was literally like they got it out of the refrigerator and they slapped down some meat. I asked if it can be microwaved but they said they weren't allowed to microwave things. Uh ok? So I asked for it to be remade but that of course caused a whole ordeal with multiple people checking to see if one could be remade. I just accepted the sandwich and took one bite and had enough and went to Paradise Bakery where they have coffee and the employees actually care about the food that they serve to their customers. I did however enjoy the chocolate covered strawberry that they give to everyone...just wished I had some coffee to go along with it.",0.0

"This review is only for the grooming and not their daycare or retail. We suddenly lost our normal groomer when they decided to close their business. Our experience here has made us appreciate our old groomers even more than we already did. 

I chose the dog stop because of convenience and because of what I could see through the windows on my commute--the brands of food seemed high quality which made me trust in their care of pets. I was initially concerned when leaving our pup off when I was told they were short staffed that day and that the groomer wouldn't know what a ""normal labradoodle cut"" is. When we picked him up, it didn't seem like they did a bad job, and I still wouldn't classify the cut as bad, but now that his fur is going back to normal from his cute puppy blow out, the errors in their groom are more apparent. We had one specific request apart from just a standard cut, to make sure his legs were both even, and they did not do that at all! So we are stuck waiting for his next groom to ensure that it is corrected again. We actually planned on taking him back yesterday to correct it, but did not have the time unfortunately. I'm also finding parts that are uneven--there are bits of hair that are clearly longer than the fur around it. They basically did most of their work on his face, which for him is most crucial when his hair gets so long, but they also trimmed his eye lashes. Are you supposed to trim a dogs eye lashes?! 

In the end, it was an ok cut but was twenty bucks more than what we used to pay and it's a good two stars below in quality. Also--they advertise that our pup should come home in a bandana. Maybe that would have made him cute enough for me not to care about the lower quality cut. Just kidding. We may give them another chance because the location is convenient, but I think we'd rather speak to the groomer directly than have the front desk girl pass on information.",0.0

The food was good , small portions but taste was very good. so what made me give a two star rating? Service. the guy that meets you in the front was very very unaccommodating in fact very rude and irritating to say the least. There was a mix up in the reservations. According to this guy host  he could not find our reservation. he was about to turn us down but seeing that there were a lot of empty tables my sister suggested why not be seated in one of them the host turned to tell us that they were reserved , so we asked when and it turned out the reservation wasn't for another hour. Seeing that we were already there and we were hungry we suggested why not take one table and just move to another when the time was up. I actually see the sense in this set up seeing that there were walk ins and they were accommodated. long story short we got the table, we had our food which was awesome (must try their dessert the green tea cheesecake and macha creme brûlée !!) but the service was totally crap! the guy kept coming back reminding us that we were under time limit??! WTF?!. guess what , by the time the guests for the 8pm reservation came - we were already having dessert and their full party of 10 wasn't even complete yet.

"Hello, welcome to 
The Mad Batter Café & Bakery. This has also been on our to do list so we ventured out and decided to give it a try. We knocked a few out in a short weekend. Made for some fun eating. Nestled in a small strip mall in a neighborhood in Henderson. As you enter its small and unassuming and the staff is real friendly. beverage orders were taken and delivered in a timely manner. I ordered the stack attack and Josie ordered the Croissant sandwich. She ordered the sauce on the side but it was delivered with sauce on the sandwich. We decided not to send it back and eat at normally served. The sauce had a small hint of heat but not so much as to be able to eat it. My Stack Attack had a home made biscuit, layer of potato hash, sausage (or Bacon). 2 eggs over easy, and smothered in gravy. This sounds good and it was. It was however (for Me) a lot at one time in a stack. Gravy was really good with lumps of sausage all through out, not grainy and abundantly served. Overall a great breakfast and very filling. Only thing again for me was the amount of onions in the hash and they were not cooked down very well. But that is a minor thing and an issue just for me.

"This is my SECOND terrible review about these apartments. I had the smell inspected in our apartment by the Manager. He confirmed that it did in fact smell pretty bad, and suspected it was cigarette smoke, indicating that one of our neighbors were chain smokers and their smoke was seeping through our walls, causing the horrific smell. 

The way to describe this smell is hard... it's a mixture of cigarette smoke mixed with something moldy. It's not a full on cigarette smell. Their solution was to give us a deoderizer that they put in the vents that came into our apartment. First off, it's an AWFUL cherry smell... so at one point as the cherry smell died down, it smelled like cherry cigarette poop (as funny as that sounds, it's quite true). 

Let me just say, my husband and I are NOT dirty people. Our apartment is packed with boxes to move so we don't cook at the apartment. There is no mold or gross things left around. This smell was there before we even moved in, but I honestly figured it was because of the apartment sitting without tenants. 

What is has come down to is that I have been living in this apartment for almost 4 months and have to endure another 2 more months with this smell. I walk in and immediately gag, I walk around the apartment holding my breath or else I will puke.

It has come to a point that the deoderizer has no effect anymore, and they failed to mention that it only last about two weeks. I would not recommend this apartment to anyone, or recommend that you get an apartment next to tenants that smoke or else it will seep through the old walls and cause your apartment to smell terrible.",0.0

"Food meh, at best. And a bit worse than meh, given the prices. Here's the breakdown.
-I love perozki and have been jonesing since leaving California--have loved pierogis in New York even more. However-----what arrived was *literally* 2 large brown dinner rolls made of bread---wtf?---no delicious dumplings with a drizzle of sour cream anywhere in sight!  One of these thick dinner rolls contained somewhat flavorful potato and the other what tasted to be boiled minced meat.  Both were SO dry I couldn't eat more than half of the potato and 1 bite of the meat. These were NOT perozki----and did not even look anything like photos on review sites like this one.
- Praga Cake was NOT a proper Praga Cake. More like chocolate *bread* with 3 layers.  It was bizarre. There's a very specific butter cream associated with Praga Cake and it was nowhere to be found. Instead a sickly sweet artificial chocolate tasting gummy mousse between layers. Tasted like a supermarket ""bakery"" product, although it was clearly made there. Just not done well, or right. Ate about 1\/2 of it and felt ill---way too syrupy, and too much almond extract (which isn't even part of the recipe).
- Beef Stroganoff: NOT a proper stroganoff. The mushrooms were good, but sadly, the sauce was C+ and no better--bland and salty. The beef was not the delicious sliced beef you expect from a stroganoff--but that same dry boiled minced beef that was in the faux-perozki. The mashed potatoes, however, were delicious!

Terrible experience with this company. Just attended a NASCAR race and saw the many kiosks on location. The weather was a little shaky but it seemed at the time the race would commence. I went up to one of the stands and spoke with a friendly sales person who convinced me to upgrade to the edge system. I handed over my card (no cash) for the rental when the race was called off. I informed the sales person that the race was off and asked for my card back showed she already charged it. I asked for a refund and she handed me a voucher for a rental good for the next day. I kindly told her that I would be leaving town and requested that she remove the charge. At this time crowds of people came yo the stand asking the same. She told everyone rain voucher or nothing. There is nothing posted about rentals being final sale and I am absolutely appalled that NASCAR a family business would allow such shady business practices. Nowhere does it say no refunds neither on the booth or the receipt. I called the toll free number on the receipt and was basically told too bad.

"I made a visit to Tako based on all the previous reviews here and many locations on the Internet calling Tako THE place to go when in Pittsburgh.  As many reviews have had recalled, I was looking forward to ""the best taco I've ever had"".  Like many other restaurants, the fish option here was clearly an afterthought.  Not bad, but pretty comparable to the fish tacos at Mad Mex, which for the price point is less of a value.

I think this could possibly be the best taco you've ever eaten if you don't typically eat tacos a lot.  My taco wasn't bad, but it also wasn't amazing.

Tako did have some redeemers though.  For starters, I got the poke and street corn.  I love street corn and thought this met the bid compared to similar corns I've had in New York and Miami.  This corn was different in that it wasn't on the cob but rather loose corn.  It was very sweet but it just made me question whether or not it was fresh.  

The poke...was fantastic!  It was a concoction like no other!  One part tuna, one part guac, one part sweet sauce, one part crisps.  All my flavor and texture needs were met far beyond expectation.  I will say it's very much an acquired taste.  But if you have it, it sends you to the moon and back.

"Some restaurants have ways to distract patrons from inherent issues that make an average dining experience into something worse.  Enter the corporate crafted look of Famous Dave's.  While nothing about this franchise location is, in itself a deal breaker, there are enough individual problems to cause concern.  To be sure, flavor profiles are well crafted, but when you serve everything at varying degrees of warm instead of hot, one wonders if the microwave is doing the most work.  To back track, I started my meal with the chicken with wild rice soup.  Flavor was good, but the wild rice was under-cooked enough to be noticeable.  Next, the rather anemic sized brisket sandwich.

"I've taken my bulldog here a few times, most recently for what I believed was a serious knee injury.  After the Dr. examined her movement and did some feeling around they suggested X-Rays in order to provide more clarity on the injury.  When I asked if X-Rays would actually show evidence of ligament damage (X-rays do not show soft tissue) I was told they would provide enough evidence based on the alignment of the bones to make an assessment.  The doctor would not provide anti-inflammatory medication without a blood test, which after seeing several other vets with multiple dogs in the last 4 years was unheard of.  Yes, we all know the risks of certain medication on a dog's kidneys, but I'm not sure it's worth the risk of leaving a dog in pain based on the situation and the dog's age.  The final result was a bill north of $300 and a diagnoses of my dog needing CCL surgery based on the X-rays and radiologist reviews.  After calling around for a week and running to consultations I finally settled on a place to do the surgery.  Fast forward to the day of surgery I drop my dog off only to receive a call a few hours later from the surgeon letting me know he's opened up her leg only to find NO ligament damage in her CCL.  But how could this be?  The X rays were so definitive...the radiologists for Ingleside were positive that there was not only knee damage but fluid build up around the knee due to said damage.  Needless to say my initial estimate of repair dropped 50% but ultimately I'm out of pocket $1500 and my dog had to undergo unnecessary anesthesia and invasive procedures based on the findings of Ingleside.  I will never go back, I hope everyone that thinks about coming here reads this review, and I will be letting every dog owner I know in the valley to steer clear of this place.

"I mean.. This pizza wasn't really all that. I would rather have Pizza from Costco. It's cheaper and tastes way better than Grimaldi's. Not to mention, the tables are WAY too small to hold a pizza if you're going with family. The tables probably would only fit two to three people at most with one single pizza. The sauce doesn't really taste like anything, almost as if it's been watered down. The cheese is a little bit rubbery on the pizza, too; not to mention, this is probably one of the most expensive pizzerias out here. The staff also never really listened. I understand that it may be busy, but when you're shouting over your customers and can't even hear a simple drink order, that's when it kind of gets a little uncomfortable. Most of the staff don't even seem like they want to be there.  2\/5 would not eat here again.",0.0

My friend and I ordered a multi course meal - apps, salad, pasta course to share and two entrees (lamb chops and steak Milanese). About 20 minutes later, the servers arrives - WITH EVERY SINGLE COURSE IN HAND.  They start rearranging the table to fit everything.  I looked up at the lead server and asked ""what are you doing?!?  Every course together?""  He then says, yes, that doesn't usually happen this way. Sorry - do you want me to take any of it back to the kitchen?""  Im thinking DUH - why did you bring it out in the first place.  I was incredulous - but yes, we'd like to eat each course in order. It's and Italian restaurant.

This is one of the places that is within walking distance of my new house and I was excited to try them out. I ordered the salmon and could not have been more disappointed with the plate that came out. The salmon was way over seasoned, over cooked and had a suspicious smell. The veggies were almost raw and unseasoned. The mashed potatoes at least were passable. To her credit the waitress noticed that I didn't touch my salmon (though I did eat the potatoes and veggies) and offered to bring me something else. At that point my group was done eating and after the disaster salmon I didn't trust that the next dish would be an improvement but they get credit for the offer.

I also paid for a FULL ARM of laser, I told them only the lower half with my hand included. The first three times they did it no problem, then the 4th time she didn't, the 5th I had to remind her and she told me I didn't pay for that and it only says lower arm on my file.

Poor quality food and service. Our waitress Jewel gave us attitude the entire time and didn't check on us but twice during a two hr visit. The food tasted sub par and had an off putting after taste similar to hard boiled eggs. Never got refills on our drinks and they got snarky when we asked if our favorite was still there and Coke to find out it was discontinued two months ago. We hadn't eaten at Applebee's in two years so we had no idea what was part of the menu! We got a steak and two side items and they up charged  us ridiculously and it turned into a $25 bill. Definitely not the quality worthy of that price! Add to all that that we both got food poisoning after our meal. Overall the worst possible service we have ever received from an Applebees location.

"I emailed this restaurant, back in June, because on the last two occasions, when I ordered the French toast, it was just barely brushed with egg mixture, on top and bottom, and the entire middle, was just dry white bread. The first time, I let it go, but the second time, I emailed the restaurant. I got a very nice letter back, from Andrew Evanko, operating partner, stating please come in again, and bring this letter, for a complimentary French toast on us. He stated there was a new grill person, who apparently had not been trained correctly, and to please give Kneaders another try. I was also told my name would be on their wall, when I came in, in regards to this. So I returned today, one month later, and brought in a copy of my email, and showed the Mgr on duty, and once again ordered the French toast. The Mgr read the letter in front of me, so she knew why I had complained in the first place. When I got the French toast, and took a few bites, I noticed it was the same as before. Just a smear of egg mixture, top and bottom, and dry white bread in the center. It was virtually tasteless. How totally indifferent on her part. No regard to the letter of complaint at all, or Andrew Evanko's reply. I walked the meal  back up to the Mgr, and she took a look, and just shrugged, and said sorry, I'll talk to the grill person again. Nothing was said about getting a new one. I left her more than half of the French toast, and told her to show it to her grill person, that this is not how this restaurant originally made their French toast.

"This past Sunday evening my husband and I decided to take his parents here after we had a great experience a few months ago; that was an HUGE mistake and embarrassment.

We called to make a reservation around 6:30 and were told they don't take them for less than 6 people but, if we were headed there soon it wouldn't be a problem as they weren't busy. The lady told us to just call when we got close and they'd make sure there was a table available. We immediately hopped in the car and called as instructed only to be told there was now an hour wait. What??? She indicated to still come and it shouldn't really be that long.

We arrived, gave our name and waited in their back yard. As we waited and waited, we witnessed a hostess seat a party of 4 that did not have all of their diners with them but, she told them that was fine. What?? Since we had our entire very hungry party ready, my husband went to ask the hostess what was up with that. She did agree that all members of the party need to be present before seated but, did not ask the 2 men to wait back outside until everyone arrived. Instead she told us it shouldn't be much longer. Frustrated, we waited some more (about a total of an hour) until finally being seated on their wobbly little stools.

The food was good, the waitress was nice but, the real kicker was when the bill came. I normally quickly look at a bill and pay it but, this time I noticed my husband's soda water was $12 (we were charged every time she refilled it), 2 orders of tiny tacos were over $30 and even more insulting a charge for more tiny pieces of toast (more=maybe 4 slices). 

I called over the waitress to ask about primarily the ridiculous amount for soda water and she at that time told us it's because it's from a bottle. What? We weren't told it was a bottle when we ordered it nor did a bottle come to the table like my father-in-law's coke. She said she'd ask her manager about adjusting it. A male manager came over that was strangely confrontational and beyond rude for such a situation, explained the whole bottle thing and would be able to take 2 of the charges off (there were 4 total). I told him that was unacceptable as we were never told we were ordering a bottle to begin with much less each time the waitress automatically refilled it. I also informed him that our experience had started off horrible, that we are locals entertaining our parents. **This is also the time I signaled our parents to leave** He seemed to be deaf to our concerns as his demeanor never changed and no apologies were given. He told us ""fine but, you'll still have to pay for one"". 

Now Folks, you may be asking ""B**ching about soda water? Really?"" Yes, because I have ZERO tolerance for liars and scammers (even here in Vegas)!

Due to his lack of customer service as a manager, he could care less about us nor our horrible experience. He adjusted the bill and came back silent. NEVER EVER apologizing. However, I did hear him ask the table behind us if everything was ok and if they needed anything.

I now owe $1,700 in fees because I apparently didn't get a piece of paper on my door.

(+) Chicken sandwiches are tasty! I have tried the Chicken Club and BBQ Chicken Sandwich in the past week and have enjoyed both. 
(+) They have a 2 for $6 promo where you have a choice to mix or match any 2 of the following: Western Bacon Cheeseburger, Famous Star, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and the                    Carl's Turkey Burger. Not a bad deal! Also the $4 deal with 2 sandwiches, small fries, and a drink all for $4! 
(+) friendly employees, for the most part..

(-) as friendly as the employees are, sometimes service can be slow as molasses! Easily my biggest complaint here...and sometimes it happens when there is no signs of any customers around.
(-) while some of the promos are good, the prices are a tad bit pricey if you want to try something not tied in to a promo. $5.69 for a chicken club from a fast food joint? Damn.


This place is alright. I like the way they do their chicken, so I will be back. If it isn't a part of a promo though, I really don't see myself trying other things on the menu. Just doesn't seem worth the price they charge for most things.

I will TRY to make this review as short & to the point as I can.  Now I understand that it's an Urgent Care and the wait time is expected.  Funny thing is, the wait time didnt annoy me the most since I was willing to wait the 3 hours to make sure everything was ok with my son.

Reason for visit: 1yo with on and off high fever for 3 days, and it may be just because hes teething and it could be nothing but that, but im a ""better safe than sorry"" mother.

-The front desk\/receptionist handles all the patient forms.  She will take your forms, insurance card and ID and keep it until she gets to your paperwork for data entry.  Patient paperwork is kept up front near her faced down, in a row of next in line (closest to her) to most recent check in (at the end).  In my opinion, as busy as an Urgent Care gets, I think there should be at least 2 people up front doing data entry, but then again would that even speed up the process?  Probably not.

-The medical assistant, oh she was just LOVELY (-_-).  I'm not a nurse but I'm pretty sure I know how to use an ear thermometer properly.  She checked his temp and it was 97.1.  As she attempted to take his pulse\/ox and didnt get a read and I know she didn't because I was holding my son while she was trying and her pulseoximeter clearly had blinking ""- -"".  After failing to get a pulse\/ox read I asked her to take his temperature again because there was no way his temp was that low.  Our last read about an hour before getting called in was at 104.x (we showed her our thermoscan).  So before taking his temp a second time after I asked, she says snobbishly ""it is what it is, I'll take it again"".  When she goes to take his temp, she presses the button, waits for a bit BEFORE putting it in his ear and not even a second after putting it in his ear, it beeps complete.  Again, she got a reading of 97.x.  As she walks out of the room, she shakes her head and ""ughs"".  As soon as she walks out, we use our thermoscan (Braun), and we get a reading of 98.6 in one ear and 99.1 in the other.  Yes, I know, not high enough to be considered a fever.  But as we told the med. assistant, hes been having fevers ON and OFF.  Point is, I know the way she took his temp. was not done properly.

Moving on...


-The PA that came in to see us...boy oh boy, was he not able to give a straight diagnosis.  We said the same thing that we explained to the med assistant the reason for our visit.  He checked my sons ears to see if he may have an ear infection, he tried to check his throat but wasnt able to, my son is teething and doesnt want anyone touching his mouth\/face.  He asked basic questions like ""does he have a cough?"", we said no., ""does he have a cold, a runny nose, congestion?"", we said its not bad, just a little runny, doesnt seem to be congested, he breathes fast when his fever is high, thats it.  He listened to his heart and lungs then asked if he has a pediatrician and if we've ever given him oral steroids.  We said no.  He said MAYBE he needs to take some to help open his lungs so he can breath.  At this point after listening to his lungs, he didnt say he was congested, to us he visibly wasnt congested.  We asked a couple of other questions regarding his teething and fever and his responses started with ""i think"" & ""i guess"" in the end he prescribed him oral predisone.  How do you, as a PA prescribe medication on no diagnosis?  Obviously we wont be giving him predisone based on that PAs i thinks and i guesses.


-The discharge assistant guy, I guess thats what he is, I just wanted to get out of there.  He comes in and asks if we had any questions and says a fever above 101.0 go to the ER, your luck of being seen with a child that age, you're not going to have to wait as long.

He offered us a great coupon if we ordered a pitcher of sangria or margherita, and said it was a great deal. So we ordered the Margherita. We ordered the all you can eat salad and meat and added the seafood ( overcooked shrimp) and went to get our stuff from the salad bar. That's where it turned bad. The person tending was cleaning the dropped food off and pushing it back into the containers with his rag, seriously disgusting!!! So we skipped eating that. Our sad plates were never taken away, and fresh plates for our meat was never given. We had to use the salad plate, and pushed what little we had on them to the side. If my feet hadn't hurt so bad we would have walked somewhere else, but I needed the break. So we gave the meats a try... the shrimp was bland and chewy. The only 2 meats that came around were extra extra extra well done and disgusting. We were ready to walk out... so upset this was my birthday trip and dinner. He said oh you're done (after he had been lost in a portal somewhere, for quite some time) I replied yes I can't eat this stuff. We expected for a manager to come over... nope, that would be good service. Instead he brought us our bill and showed us what 20 &25% tip would be. Really?

"So I got my 3D eyebrows done by neezie back in April. I waited to write this review to see how my eyebrows would heal, and if it was possible for someone to do a better job. Let me just tell you in advance that I found both. She is a nice woman, but she is overpriced and inexperienced
Compared to other businesses out here doing the 3D brow\/ microblading technique. 1st thing, I told her exactly what I wanted done. It seems like she doesn't know how to draw a brand new shape, only add more to your natural shape, which is unfortunate when your paying 400$ for someone to tattoo your dream eyebrows. She didn't draw my eyebrows so I could approve the shape before she started. She microbladed the outside shape, asked if I liked it, then filled it in permanently.....good thing I liked the outlined shape or I would have been out of luck. It looked good at 1st......but the results essentially disappeared after a week. And looked COMPLETELY different after healing, the eyebrows essentially disappeared! What prompted me to write this review was the amazing experience I had with a 3DBrow\/MicroBlading tech else where. It was through that experience I saw how this technique is really supposed to be done! #1 she draws on the exact shape that I want 1st, she doesn't put the needle to my skin until it's perfect. She corrected and re-drew the shape on until it was perfectly even, then she started. She has a mirror facing me THE WHOLE TIME the procedure is being done. This allows me to interject when I think she has missed a spot or something doesn't look right. The price for Neezie was $500 NOT including the touch up . When I went to another salon She charged $300 and included the touch up. She was baffled how someone would not include a touch up at that price when essentially it's impossible to not get a touch up done after. She also commented that Neezie did not do the initial application dark enough at all, which is why it almost completely faded After 9 days. Maybe with more practice Neezie could be good, but I definitely would recommend going else where. The woman that fixed mine after Neezie did them, made them look so Beautiful! Exactly how I dreamed and they didn't disappear after they healed! She has also been doing permanent makeup for 30+ years. For permanent eyebrows you have to wait until they FULLY heal to give a true valid review, and this is what I have done. For anyone seeking this service, save yourself the money and hassle, go to someone with more experience and who will take the time to make sure your results are impeccable.

Now come December 11 on my birthday of all days my car once again stalled in the middle of a different busy intersection almost getting hit by a HUGE truck! Once again i got my car off the road! Finally was able to bring it back to this Nissan dealership overnight. The next morning never got a call from anybody to tell me what was going on with my vehicle. By around 12 i called in to see what was up. The service advisor his name was Gary was a complete asshole, never once apologized for anything every time I would try to talk he would talk over me without hearing what I had to say and when I told him that once again my vehicle stalled in the middle of an intersection all he said was well this is a different situation it's not the same from last time. Really? After all this ruckus with Gary we asked to speak to somebody that was higher up than him like a manager. he gave us the info for the manager tyrel russel whom we have tried calling many times and no answer or call back! We also got some information on a Bill Brixley and tried calling him MANY times and either it goes to voicemail or the people hang up on us! What kind of service is this! Please people save your money and go elsewhere this facility doesn't care about their customers all they care about is the money they're getting out of them!!!",0.0
"Went in to have my nails done and the wait took almost 25 minutes! There were only 2 girls on the floor. I was in no rush. When I was seated the nail women was so RUDE. I had acrylic nails on previously and I asked if she could remove the left over cuticle from the nail, she said I'll try my best I have another client after you. Right then and there she was rushing me. She also never talked to me. She never introduced herself or anything too. I would not recommend this place to anyone because of the horrible incident. Not to mention they only have around 20 polish to pick from. That's nothing. FYI a full set of nails for toes and fingers is a WHOOPING $130. That's ridiculous!! I could spend that on way more practical things.",0.0

The kids meals were fine and I liked the plastic box they put them in. 

I ordered a small club and it was made rather odd. It seemed as though the toppings were only put on one half of the sandwich. One side had turkey, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and avocado. No bacon, bell pepper, olive or pickle. The other half seemed it have it all. Lots of olives, bell pepper, pickle ect. Having it all on one side made it very hard to eat and it was quite messy. I'm not sure how or why it was made that way. Like I said glad I had an offer that just had me pay for the drink.",0.0

"If I could give this place less than one star I would. Where do I even begin??  Management is a hassle to deal with, we had a leak in our ceiling(a very bad one) and their solution was to cut 2 giant holes in our ceiling each about 1ft by 1ft and leave it open. Those holes stayed open for 2 months, in those two months both myself and my boyfriend had severe respiratory infections due to the mold from the constant leak. The office couldn't be bothered by it and maintenance told us several times that they had to use an outside contractor and someone would be by to fix it in a ""couple days"". 

There are very frequent gun shots that ring out from the neighborhood behind the complex as well as the fact the residents from that neighborhood frequently jump the wall separating the complex from those houses and even go as far as pulling down the metal rebar on top of the wall to keep them out. Their ""security guard"" is a joke. He's only there on the weekends and spends most of his time texting in the laundry room by the gym. The police are there at least once a week on account of many fights, noise complains, drug related issues, and domestic disputes. 

My best advice is, avoid this place like the plague. The only problem we didn't have were roaches, every other building around us was infested with them but for some reason we never even found one in our unit. If you type in crosswinds on Google, you should be able to find a news report on AZ central about how bad the complex is. That should be enough to deter you from living here.",0.0

So I declined and decided to go back to my dentist that was way over on the other side of town.

I went to see Jeff Foxworthy who was supposed to be the main event on Fri nite. They used his name for sales but he didn't even come out until after 11pm ( show started 8pm). he was great but we should have been informed that there were 3 hours of other acts.,0.0
Slow service this time. I went in and ordered 3 burritos. I am sitting in the front right by the register waiting for my number to be called. The guy and the girl at the register asked me what my number was. I told them 104!! As I sit there waiting for my food and seeing others who ordered after me get their food i patiently wait. They clearly realized the skipped me and either didn't get my order made or they gave my food to someone else. They finally after 20 mins I get my food. I told the guy that you clearly skipped me and they should at least give me a drink for waiting so long. The guy told me that they called my number already. I said I was right here in the front the whole time waiting to be called. You guys obviously asked me my number. Why would u ask for my number if you realized I was sitting there forever waiting for my number to be called. The guy tried to blame me for their mistake. He also tried to say that the cook messed up the orders. Well man which one is it. Is it my fault or the cook. He didn't own that he made a mistake and a he didn't even apologize. He was even hesitant to give me a drink. Poor customer service. The people around me were even stating that they skipped me. This place has great food but customer service is not so great.,0.0

"To start this review, yes, I speak Spanish and although I am used to Banda and Norteño, I also enjoy going to a salsa\/bachata club such as this one and the dj mix was pretty good.
It is an interesting mix of things here but the rip off atmosphere was a terrible experience.
First, I called ahead to make reservations or see what the options were. We were told to just come by and not have any issues.

We arrived at this place via taxi and then the bouncer announced it over the radio that we arrived via taxi so that was a red flag already.
From there on, everyone we ran into seemed to want to get paid. Everyone had a comment or story to get tipped or over tipped which felt really abusive.
We tried to look for a place to sit but most of the tables stated that they were reserved. . . well that pissed me off since we were told that we didn't need to make a reservation (and we arrived upon opening).
So in order to get a table, we asked about the bottle service and the waitress looked excited and told me that it started at $185 which is not entirely true as I saw $235 was more like the price she should be giving people. I read the disclaimer on the bottom of the menu and it stated that it included everything as well as gratuities so I thought that was actually a pretty good deal then. She brought the bottle and two juices and a bill for $295? She then also proceeded to tell me that the tip was not included but not mandatory and really pushed to have me tip her. So I found that a bit confusing and misleading. With distrust, I handed her $50 cash and then never saw her again?! There were bus boys that came by rarely to refill the juice but definitely didn't feel like bottle service. it was terrible! But hey, I guess I got a $350 table to sit at.

Because I had such a poor experience, I decided to interview the front area cashier as well as the bathroom attendant for more information on gratuities. . . which costed me $20 to get to talk to them of course. And they told me right straight with confidence that the bottle service already came all inclusive. I then told them about my situation and the story changed immediately to backing up their coworker instead. It was a very fishy night but at least they knew how to band together.

Of course, to end the night, I asked for a taxi. I saw everyone who were waiting for one and everyone who was ever at the front area since I was trying to be a good host to my friend. When the taxi came for us, while everyone knew we were waiting for one outside patiently, I saw a new person that just stole our ride totally not in line for the taxi we waited for 20 min in the cold.
Granted, with my obvious anger, after another 15 minutes, they asked their shuttle driver to take us back to our hotel. We knew how much it costed to get to the club via taxi during traffic hours so we knew not to pay more than that. When he grabbed us at the front of the club, he seemed to be polite and courteous. When he left the club and had us in the van, he started asking me for an ""optional"" $40. I really don't understand this place? Are you guys starving? or are you used to drunk people that you think you can take advantage of? Lucky for me, I was not drunk and recall all of this as well as told him I knew how much it costed me to get here. So then he looked guilty and said to give him what I felt like giving him. What a terrible place with terrible workers.

Went to have dinner at the buffet and GVR raised their prices once again and now it is way too expensive for a buffet! Much better at Wicked Spoon over at Cosmo for around the same price for a more gourmet experience and way better desserts! Even Ceasars is much better for same price! The staff are nice at the buffet but the Sea Food wasn't worth the $29.99. GVR management should rethink  how they run GVR. The once nice hotel is failing fast.

The pork sandwich was awful, the pulled pork was a mushy mess with the consistency of runny mashed potatoes. Speaking of mashed potatoes, they were so salty they were basically in edible. I will never go back to rock bottom again, even though the beer I tried was decent, the food more than ruined the entire meal.  I am only giving them two stars because the waitress was a sweetheart and tried very hard to make up for the shortcomings of the kitchen.

"Neg stars. Don't go 2 sch here! Wanted 1\/2"" roots-only lighter color & left w\/ 3ft yellow hair! I Q AIPs following industry Best Practices & Aveda standards. I would've never trusted a student, but I sure trusted the wrong EDUCATOR. Their Aveda Certified Educator, Color Specialist, 2014 Inspire Greatness Aveda Institute Champion combo cosmetology TEAM LEAD (TL) did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her & student (S). Plus, she formulated unorthodox chemicals for someone w\/ my coloring. Even AVEDA CORP said she should've known better.

Adjust contrast\/brightness of your monitor N order 2 C the true colors of my pix. As per AIP, the .pdf\/evidence of my instructions keeps being deleted from YELP.

I said 2x to ea & wrote once ""Apply color to new growth only."" They put color 4.5"" past my 1\/2"" of new growth. I said I wanted 2 go 1- 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60g of Deep 10N @ 45 mins. The written instructions also said, ""Do not use foils, pull through, or use a gloss."" This formula & method provided me with an earthy honey blond. B\/c I wore my hair in the same braid @ all my outdoorsy jobs, my hair looked like multi-toned whipped honey peppered w\/ sparkly platinum streaks.

TL formulated: 40 vol 60g of Deep 12N @ 45 min w\/ shower cap.

My crown turned POLAR BEAR WHITE (PBW). In response, TL, who teaches blonding classes, said, ""I didn't expect this to be so light. Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard."" Then TL said she'd fix it.

TL formulated: 40g 0N + 40g 10N + 1g  Lite Yellow Orange + 40mL of CTA.

Unfortunately, TL & S coated all my hair--not just the white part. TL tried 2 dilute the mistake-not fix it. This wasn't prudent. FINAL RESULT: my crown was monochromatic yet streaky ELECTRIC BUTTER YELLOW & the rest of my normally glossy multi-d sun-kissed honey blond hair was DULL, DRY shades of homogeneous STRAW YELLOW w\/ PUMPKIN ORANGE tones. My entire head was a color mullet in shades of Crayola Crayons. And this was the ""fixed"" version?

When I got really upset, an older blond mgr told me to come back in 2-3 days after my hair calmed down for a FREE color correction. At 1st, I accepted. I had been there for 5 hours & was exhausted, hungry, & so very much wanted it to be fixable. But, after all my research, I realized how egregious the mistakes were & wasn't going to subject myself to a 2nd multi-mistake incident.  There was no way my hair or I could handle a 3rd trauma. She's THE BEST of THE BEST--and this is what happened??? I stopped my cc payment the following week, &  AIP did not contest it.

I learned, much later, from Aveda Educators around the country, Color Specialists in the valley, & Aveda Corp, 40 vol is used on people with black\/choco, coarse, & thick hair who want 2 go platinum or Crayola-colored. (I have naturally dark-blond, fine hair; fair, yellow-toned skin; and dark green eyes. How could she not notice this?) She used one of the lightest possible Lift-Color-Methods: 40vol\/Deep 12N\/Shower cap.

1-2 shades lighter is literally changing only Deep 10N to Deep 11N or 12N--not changing the volume, especially together with color, and most especially w\/n the Deep line. Deep already has extra vol\/lift contained in it. Adding a shower cap on top of all the extra changes is baffling. A Color Specialist noted that 1-2 shades lighter could be achieved by just adding foils 2 the original formula I've used for yrs or rinsing out @ 30 mins instead of 45 mins. Also, CTA= gloss, & professionals never tone 3ft-long blond hair.

The TL should have never bumped me up to 40 vol, especially w\/shower cap. This is significant b\/c I asked her, as we looked at my written formula & instructions, if she could only change 1 number, which would it be, & she responded that she wouldn't; she'd change BOTH!!!! I also discovered that TL was NOT S's official Educator. (I'm not sure if TL took over my hair b\/c she wanted to experiment w\/ it, but it's hard NOT to consider this her true motive.)

The formula TL used on my already-blond hair caused 5 levels of lift (not 1-2 shades), which explains the PBW. She stripped my crown of all color by highlighting my whole head, & even bleached my scalp. It flaked & itched. If she didn't expect my hair to turn white, then, tell me, WHAT COLOR DID SHE EXPECT IT TO TURN?

Their TL does not truly understand blonding or Deep. This will take me 6 years to grow out permanently altered & damaged hair and about $1K to patch up. This color service set me back K's 4 time, gas, both corrective & blue\/purpl products; & they're not paying me back. Now, I have hi maintenance hair & may have 2 cut short it in the future d\/t drynessI can't speak for other Educators at this institute, but I can speak for the TL, & seriously question AIPs adherence to industry Best Practices, Aveda superior standards, & basic ethics. AIP is sneaky, dishonest, & not BBB accredited

"Line for the regular cheesecake was too long so I decided to try the Matcha cafe.
Ended up trying their Matcha ""soft serve"" which tasted more like a frozen yogurt than anything. Also tried the Matcha latte and their madeleine which were both okay. But that soft serve got me really disappointed.

Verdict: The matcha cafe was nothing special, hence there wasn't really a line for it. If you want something that's good and want to wait in line for it, then their regular cheese cake is pretty good.

I can't think of any reason to ever return with all of the other options you have on Vegas. Pretty disappointing experience. The service from our server was over the top though.

We ordered the platter for two for $60, the tacos for $16, and a corn bread for $8 I think.  This was more than enough to feed one dude and two gal.  The food is a tad better than most bar restaurant; jack and milestones, etc.  So you are really paying more for just the chic atmosphere.

"In terms of facilities space and equipment, the gym gets a 4.  But the quality of the class instructors and the helpfulness of the support staff downgrades the overall rating to a 2.  I signed up for the cycling classes and having taken classes across the US at Soulcycle,  Brick Bodies, other major chains, the classes here are the worst.  Repetitive, no upper body movement, and constant screaming from the instructors.  A louder voice doesn't make for a better class.  It's a shame, considering they have one of the best stadium seating cycling facilities I've been to.

This place gets two stars because of the service. Our waiter was too busy socializing with his coworkers (I could see him chatting with them from where we were sitting) to refill our drinks or bring us our checks. I had to get up from the table to get his attention.

"Took my sister here for her birthday. I loved this hotel; however, the desk staff was horrible and they have lost my business forever. I gave a credit card for my stay got to my room and could not access internet so I called down and was told I had no credit card on file. They gave me an Internet code and gave me the option to come down now or just pay the resort fees when I checked out. The women failed to notate any of that. My 2nd night in they sent someone to my room who tried to come in because my sick wife didn't get to the door quick enough. They said we need to come down immediately and pay for the resort fees even though I was told I could just do it later. He even said we have had issues with our system kicking credit cards out so just talk to the front desk. I go down to the front desk and waited patiently for 30 min as the manager dealt with some irate women yelling over her credit card being charged to much. After helping her he left the front desk and the guy who was helping me disappeared to get a manager and never came back. I waited another 10 min and finally got iratated and ask what was taking so long. The manager came out and apologized as he forgot and offered to waive my resort fees, keep in mind I never asked for this and was willing to pay. I come home and I have a charge for resort fees, I called to complain and was basically told he didn't notate both fees were being waived just one and was told they were not willing to comp the other. At this point I will never stay here again, the resort fee was not a big deal anyone who goes to Vegas regualary knows about these fees. I'm upset at the fact the fee removal was proactively solicited to me for all of this nonsense and to be told he didn't do what he said and they would not honor this shows the Wesgate is not really worried about client satisfaction as they did not offer to even ask the manager about it.

"Matt is lucky to get a 2 from me. Email after email trying to get an update on my product for my b8 s4, Matt would hardly reply to each one at least 2 weeks later. It took more than 7 months to complete and he stated that one main piece was already made. (When his site says no more than a month to complete). I finally received my pieces and as I was excited to finally see the ""amazing"" quality, I was not very pleased. Bumpy and uneven clear coat  on most of the trim, with heavy orange peel on another and what looks to be a cover up spot on one piece. I can't believe for how much he charges that he would let this pass. The trim doesn't fit like they use too either. Charging big $$$ for his sub par quality is definitely not worth it especially when he doesn't give you any updates nor trust with your hard earned money....As for my deposit he did didn't redeem me after countless emails. 3 months later he finally pay pals me and doesn't even give me the full amount back. (PayPal fee) If I did a bit more digging into his company I would have never ordered through him. Customer service is complete crap and quality is not good for his prices.",0.0
We have been to other Brazilian steakhouses so we know what to expect. The salad bar was smaller than others we have been to. would have like a few more visits by the meat servers. For those reasons I give a 3 star grade...the meat we did get to try was good.,0.0
These joints like TGIF and Applebees are a disgrace to food. All they do is take frozen things out of the freezer and throw into fryer or onto a grill. You don't even to have to be a real chef to work in this place. Just a reheater. Had their appetizer samplers last night. Disgusting. Chicken wings were so old and had been frozen so long. The bones inside were black. Nothing fresh on the plate. Service mediocre. My pet peeve is  taking 20 minutes to pay the bill after dinner. Waitress busy gabbing back in waitress station.,0.0
"Very Disappointed!  The reclining sectional  that we bought is so uncomfortable that my family would rather not even sit on it period!

"Let me preface this by saying that I do not usually post bad reviews. Also, I have been here multiple times and while the juices are always great, the salads\/grain bowls have never lived up to my expectations. I've tried several and they have all been very bland. Unfortunately this is really the only place to go to for a quick 'healthy' option around dinnertime in downtown PHX. Kaleidoscope is amazing (both juice and food) but they close at 3. 

So...I came in to the restaurant yesterday around 7 pm. I ordered a Gangnam City salad and substituted salmon instead of steak. I also got a large Power juice. When I got home and opened the box, I noticed a terrible smell. It literally smelled like garbage. Taking a closer look, I realized that the bean sprouts were spoiled. They had a clear brown look to them and if you have seen fresh bean sprouts before, they are supposed to be crisp, opaque and white. I can't be sure that that alone was creating such a terrible stench, but it was definitely the main reason. The lettuce and salmon looked ok, so I thought I would try and salvage this meal and give it a chance. I literally picked out the bean sprouts, one by one, and transferred the rest of the ingredients into a different container. I then proceeded to douse the new plate in lime juice, hoping that it will take away any traces of that terrible smell. I took one bite and had to spit it out because it tasted totally spoiled. It was not edible and went straight to the trash. 

PLEASE pay better attention to the freshness of your food ingredients. I don't want anyone else to experience what I experienced. I really wanted to give 1 star but because I've never had an issue with the juice, I will give 2. However, I won't be coming back for food again.

I purchased a leather sectional for $2800 in May of last year.  I was with my boyfriend and the Sales Rep asked if we wanted to purchase the ""Leather Warranty"" and when we asked what it covered he let us know it covered ALL accidental damage.  He even went on to say ""you never know when someone has a pen in their pocket that may bleed to puncture a whole in the leather"".  I was convinced and decided to purchase the warranty for an additional $200. 

Fast forward 6 months later I notice a pen mark on the sofa.  I think to myself; no big deal, I'll just call the warranty.  First I call the store and the sales rep let's me know that ink is not included.  I tell her that it's not what I was told when I purchased the warranty and explain the whole situation.  Still she would not fix it. 

I then ask to speak to the manager.  She looks up the account and tells me that there is nothing she can do.  See then looks up my account and lets me know that ""Anthony"" was my sales rep, and that he's worked there for a long time so he knows the policy.  I let her know that although he may know the policy its not what I was told.  She still does nothing to help.

I then call the 1-800 number I found online.  I got transferred 8 times before I could talk to a manager and NO ONE would do anything fix the situation.  I have never been more upset with a company. Save yourself some time and money and go somewhere else. I spent over $3000 and purchased a warranty but RC Willey has not done anything to resolve the situation.",0.0
"***Delano is a nice and modern hotel, but it is expensive and in the Mandalay Bay so it is located far from a lot of the energy and things to do on The Strip***

Delano is a modern hotel that is part of and adjacent to Mandalay Bay.  It has a separate entrance with its own lobby and café, lounge and coffee bar, and it does not have its own casino though one is just a few minutes away in the Mandalay Bay.  For some reason, I felt the lobby had an odd smell as the amount of perfume-strong scent they were pumping in was potentially conflicting with other smells in the area.

My Delano room was nice with modern décor, a comfortable bed and a few luxurious notes throughout (it felt like a very nice and new W in a big city).  My room was not that big and because the bathroom was a handicap-accessible one, it did not have the most ideal shower.

I did not use the TV, but I did like how you can use a digital switch to inform housekeeping if you prefer Do Not Disturb or that you are ready for housekeeping.  Delano does have a fitness center, but I did not check it out.  

Service was good and friendly.

Room rates are high.  You pay more than Mandalay Bay and even though the rooms are nice, Delano \/ Mandalay Bay is just so far from The Strip.  There is definitely a lot to do at the Mandalay Bay with a variety of restaurants and activities, but getting to the main action on The Strip is either a taxi ride, a very long walk or a series of free trams like the Mandalay Bay tram to Excalibur and the CityCenter tram that take a good bit of time.

Overall, Delano is a good option if you can get a great deal from an online booking site and do not mind the long trip it takes to get to the center of The Strip.  However, if the room rate is high, and you plan on spending a lot of your time at CityCenter, Bellagio or Palazzo, Delano is probably not your best option.

I had already fixated on the Salmon BLT ( seared salmon, avocado, arugula, tomato, smoked salmon ""bacon"" with a tarragon caper mayo on a brioche bun). Sounds delish doesn't it?! I got the salad bar as my side, which is available weekdays for lunch. I went ahead and dug in for the salad while I waited for my sandwich. The salad bar options were all very fresh, though not something I imagine you could make much of a meal out of (which is an option) Probably best as a meal accompaniment. Also there were only 4 dressing choices, and 2 were very similar. 

My sandwich arrived and I still hadn't received a basket of the complimentary sweet potato chips, so I kindly asked her if I could get a basket, she apologized for having forgot and quickly brought some over. First thing I noticed when the sandwich arrived was a bit of a strange smell, but I chalked it up to being the smoked salmon bacon since I couldn't identify it right off (later realizing it reminded me of a kitchen sink drain but had no ""issues"" so I guess it was fine). I tasted a piece of the salmon that had fallen off the sandwich since they were on there in chunks and it was pretty flavorless. I ended up having to salt the thing...I don't know the last time I had to salt a sandwich. The combination of ingredients was all just a little too soft since the salmon ""bacon"" wasn't actually crispy. So texturally it missed the mark. Flavorwise it was unexciting.They should have just used a lot more of the ""bacon"" on the sandwich since it was extremely flavorful on its own.

"I've had cox service for 3 years now. They provide a product that will never keep up with technology, both my internet and tv service have been spotty - service has gone out at times, on demand has not worked many times, internet service is slower than it should be, tv menu and actions are slow, I've had to exchange equipment multiple times. And all the while, they just keep jacking up the prices. I've been out of my contract for a year now, and they refuse to work with me on a reasonable price without getting back into a contract.

CANCELLING is much harder than signing up.

He said his system said it was sent successfully (for the second time), yet hours later I still have no messages (and not in junk or trash either) from LA Fitness.

Initial review:

We went to check it out on Saturday afternoon.  The sales guy (they call themselves something else) was nice, but he wanted us to fill out a profile.  I told him we weren't going to do that, and certainly weren't going to sign up today, but we just wanted to know how much it costs.  He insisted that he show us around (apparently mandatory).  I was pleased with the place, especially the pool.  I did have to kick a dumbell bar out of the walkway.  There was a trainer right next to it, and he didn't bother to pick it up, even though he could see that the sales guy was giving a tour.  I thought that was odd.  I was a little concerned that their was some broken glass in the parking lot.  The guy at the front desk averred that someone had broken into a couple of cars a few days ago at 5AM.

He mentioned the towel service and that they just bought 24-hour fitness and our membership would be good at all their clubs. He told us how much it would cost, then the used car\/timeshare routine began.  Eventually he went to get his manager.

Parking is kind of tight, but that's nothing new in any of the shopping centers on Spring Mountain.

When giving our name to the person at the entrance, he said three times, and without even making eye contact with my husband, who is 6'6"" and African American, that it was nice to have him with them, which I thought very odd.  That's okay though because we run into racial profiling off and on so I was just going to let it go.  We were led down the staircase into the dining room where we were seated at a big round table for four (we had three) and basically forgotten about after our waters were brought and the fish specialist did his routine and described all of the fish they had available.  It took so long for anyone to come by to take our order that I actually had to ask one gentleman if we could get some service.  All in, dinner was $180 before tipping and service was mediocre at best.  Would not recommend or return.",0.0

"My family and I love going to pho places so when my aunt recommended this one, we went to try it out for dinner after a long day.  I have to admit that I'm pretty surprised that this place has such low reviews.  As I checked in on Yelp at the beginning of our stay, I was a bit wary while I ordered due to the low ratings but, nevertheless, we ordered as we would have anywhere else and we were not disappointed - maybe they're aware of the low reviews and stepped up their game that night or maybe it depends on when you go that the food turns out good or bad. In our case - it was pretty good!

We ordered two orders of spring rolls ($3.95 per order for 2 rolls - crispy fried rice paper rolls w\/ shrimp & pork, veggies, & taro) to start - they were pretty good - the sauce needed a bit more flavour but the rolls were cooked nicely. We had the large size chef's special beef rice noodle soup ($9.50; S - $7.50 ... there's no in-between size though) which had brisket, flank, & beef tendon, tripe, & beef balls. When you first get the soup it looks like there's almost no noodles but it's hidden under the meat and other ingredients - stir it up and the large bowl of soup was enough for our group of four (but if you come here just for the pho on empty stomachs, the large is good enough for two).  Broth was pretty good - average but I'd eat it again if I came by. 

We also ordered stir-fried chicken in lemon grass w\/ vermicelli which was good - not our fave dish of the night though - something was missing to round out the flavours($8.95). Our favourite dish was the grilled pork chop with rice ($8.95) - marinated with a sweet flavour and cooked well, I recommend this one over the chicken vermicelli dish. 

Overall, Pho Quinn is a good place for Vietnamese cuisine - service was friendly, quick, and frequent to ask how we were doing and the ambience is clean and modern. While the food isn't amazing, I'd say it's average or even a bit above and worth a try.",0.0
"This business will rip you off. Stay away!!!!

I cracked the screen on my iPhone and took it to be repaired at Gadget Experts on 6\/26\/2016. About 2 months later, the screen started lifting off of the frame so I took it back and they graciously accepted fault for the craftsmanship of the repair and fixed it for free. 

Today, 11\/19\/2016, the screen started lifting off again in the EXACT same manner so I took it back to Gadget Experts. I explained to BRANDON (what a waste of air that one is sucking up) that this was my second time back with the same issue his business had already taken responsibility for previously. He offered to fix it for 50% off. I explained to him that I was not willing to accept a discount as I paid for 100% of the repair cost to fix 100% of the phone. I also explained that I paid for a permanent repair, not a temporary fix that I have to keep throwing money at. Keep in mind that I didn't have an issue with the screen lifting off until they ""repaired"" it the first time.

I didn't write this post simply because of the money that Gadget Experts screwed me for, but rather for the principal. If your business is consumer facing and you simply do not care about the quality of service you provide those consumers, then you WILL lose that business.

You can look to other reviews on Yelp to confirm this is the way Gadget Experts does business as there is another review with a very similar situation as mine from September. I also urge you to look at my other Yelp reviews to determine that I don't post negative reviews often.

"I moved here from out of state and signed up for direct TV service they talked me into bundling my internet with Century Link and adding my Verizon cell phone to the account to save $15 a month. Century Link took my direct payment auto-billed each month but due to communication issues the money would not make it to Direct TV or Verizon, even though they took my full payment each month the money was not distributed which lead to my TV being cancelled each 60 days at which point I would have to spend 1-4 hours on various customer support numbers having them figure out how to send the money they had collected through Century Link to Direct TV. This went on got over 9 months before I decided that the time and effort I was expending each month was costing me so much time out of my regular life to deal with all this non-sense so in addition to almost a week of lost time given up to them on customer service lines I realized the only way to end the insanity was to unhook my combined billing which they charged me $250 to do even though I had proof that they did this to me through documentation I requested each time I was wrongfully disconnected.

"****** Same day update since Yelp won't let me write a separate one on the same day ******

I've never been too prideful to admit that I've made a bone-headed move.  In my initial review of this place, I irresponsibly wrote that that they use ""artificial flavors"" in their shaved ice without knowing for sure and just throwing it out there based on assumption. I've since amended that to just ""flavor.""

This was brought to my attention by the owner who, despite having every right to rip me a new one, sent me a very polite message regarding my initial review, informing me they do not use artificial flavors and inviting to check out their kitchen next time I stop by, which i will, and also suggest you do.

This does nothing to change my review at this time.  The taste is what it is to me, and my reviews are mostly taste-based, though I did very much appreciate the message from the owner.  This is mainly a public mea culpa, plus some additional information for you to consider.

2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.

4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Don't get me wrong, I'm really, really glad that a Taiwanese-style shaved ice place is here in Phoenix.  It's the best there is here in the Valley and you should go.  But coming from Southern California, where there is ample delicious shaved ice, I have to rank this guy somewhere in the middle of the road.  

My biggest knock on this place is the flavor.  The flavoring they use has a really distinct chemically taste and aftertaste.  It's not so off-putting that I wouldn't go back, but it does bump this place down a couple notches.  That being said, the texture of the ice is perfectly fine, and I like the variety that they have.

"Sweet Tomatoes is one our favorite places to go.  This is the first time we've been to this location.  It was the worst experience ever.  We went this past Monday for dinner.  We both love Mexican food and welcome the variety at Sweet Tomatoes.  If we were in the mood for just Mexican, we would have gone to a Mexican Restaurant.  There was lime, cilantro and sugar in almost everything.  Soup: Chicken Tortilla, Mexican Stew, Posole.  Pizza: Quesadilla PIzza.  Baked Potatato station: Pico de gallo, cilantro (no chive available) --we asked.  Pasta:  Cilantro Lime Penne Pasta (the sauce was separated, greasy and sweet) it was the worst pasta I ever had.  BTW all three pasta choices were penne pasta, even the ""macaroni"" and cheese.  Dessert:  Margarita Muffin-- my husband literally spit it out and asked me to taste it. I of course didn't.  Don't me wrong we love Mexican food.  It may have even been ok if it tasted good but it didn't.  There was only vanilla soft serve available but there was still chocolate dripping down the machine and in the receptor.  My husband is a Chef and I am a pastry chef.  We go to Sweet Tomatoes due to the consistency of quality, product and service.  We will never go to this location again.  We may try the Summerlin location or another in Las Vegas one more time to give it one more chance.  I am hoping it isn't a company or regional decline.

"OK, takeout from Red Bowl has been in the meal rotation for our house for a couple of years now. Tonight we decided to assess their performance, because their are many good Asian alternatives in the area.
We looked up the menu online and placed an order by phone. When I got there, there was some hassle because the payment process is different for phone-in takeout vs. if you sit at the bar, have a beer, and order takeout. They have a decent beer selection, so I had to pay twice.
The consensus on the food: the sushi is below grocery store quality (and its puny - see pic), the soup and pad Thai are decent, if you ask for any dish to be extra spicy it will be mildly spicy, and my son likes the fried rice. The bottom line is that there are too many good Asian food choices down here now to settle for mediocre. Next time we will go back to Asian Grill in Waxhaw or Asian 18 in Blakeney.",0.0

"We were here for the soft opening four years ago, and it was very good. In fact, it was almost comparable to The Buffet at Wynn and The Wicked Spoon. We returned a year later, and it was less memorable but still good. Three years on, this place has gone way downhill. We were here for the ""holiday buffet."" Just about everything we ate was crusty, congealed, and flavorless, and the price is higher than the far superior Wynn buffet. It was clear that dishes, especially desserts, had been refrigerated and set back out. The phô broth was barely even lukewarm. Every pastry we sampled had soft, soggy crust (poor technique, storage, or not fresh), and the cake part of the carrot cake was so dry it was developing its own toast-like crust. Very poor labeling of dishes. What was labeled shrimp and grits was actually chorizo or some kind of ground meat with grits. Some dishes were unlabeled. We were very disappointed because we're staying in the City Center area, and Aria is convenient. The Thai tea and the service weren't bad. But we'll need to see an ""Under New Management"" sign before coming back.",0.0
"Sukiyaki was good and flavorful. Also, ordered a rib eye shabu shabu with spicy miso broth. My husband and I both did not care for the broth taste. Overall, food was okay. I've had much better in LA for a better price with more veggie assortments.

Service is requiring much improvement. Waited quite awhile until our order was taken and for our food to arrive to our table. Noticed that multiple tables were not cleared for awhile. Water was not refilled once. I had asked a question to two different servers about our order and neither one seemed to speak english very well. Lastly, it took 15 minutes before I could grab someones attention for our check and then waited another 15 minutes hoping we'd receive our check. Finally, I walked up to the front to get it and pay. I noticed other tables were equally frustrated with the lack of service. There were at least 3 other tables that had to walk up to ask for a check as well. It seems like service is something this location struggles with according to several reviews posted in the past few years. I can understand why.",0.0

"I recently purchased a vehicle via a Credit Union Car Sale, and could not be more disappointed (to say the very least) with this dealership.  From start to finish it took over 6 hours to complete the transaction - I left the dealership after 8p, I originally arrived at the dealership around 2pm, and was at the Credit Union Car Sale speaking to their personnel before that.  I was told a great vehicle was back at the dealership (not the Car Sale location) that I should take a look at.  The dealership personnel at the Car Sale called their manager (at the dealership) and told him I would be stopping by within the next hour to see this very vehicle, which I did.  

When I arrived at the dealership no one knew where the vehicle was, and repeatedly told me 'I'm coming into this cold' - in other words no one had any idea of what was going on regarding me, or the vehicle I was interested in looking at.  I should have left then.  After test driving another vehicle that was 'like' what I came to see I had to wait to see the vehicle I originally came to see for quite some time.  At no time did the dealership offer me anything - not water, nothing.  The negotiation for the trade value on my vehicle was also a low balling fiesta.  Back and forth we went.  Truly a classless way to do business especially when I had a copy of the trade values for my vehicle from the credit union printed that very day.  I was kind enough to allow them to copy said document before my vehicle was appraised.  My vehicle was low mileage, fresh oil change - always changed on time, clean with very flew blemishes.  We finally agree upon a trade price - which I still feel was too low.

I wish I could insert the standard time lapse video effects we see on television here, because hours went by for no apparent reason.  I was given very few updates on where we were in the process.  Then, I was told I better go to dinner because it will be a long time before I can sign finance paperwork.  They had taken the license plate off my vehicle and did not offer to pay for my meal nor give me a ride to a suitable place to dine.  Again, classless operation. 

There was damage to the 'new' vehicle that was not noted or mentioned to me until moments before signing the paperwork.  When I brought this to their attention, the manager was unwilling to take the situation seriously and do a full inspection of the vehicle with me, clipboard in hand, so we both could agree on what needed to be done.  He simply, and casually promised to fix things.  When I arrived in the finance office the damage that needed addressed was only partially noted on the paperwork.  When I told the finance person that the list of agreed upon repairs was incomplete he immediately called the sales manager in to rectify the situation.  Moments later the manager what at the door and said, 'Do I need to be here?'  Again, disrespect to me and to his organization.

I was told to call the next business day to have the repairs to the vehicle performed.  Finally, I rolled out of the lot at 8:03p.

I called the next business day, and was told to bring the vehicle in for the needed repairs.  I visited the service department.  No one knew what was going on.  I was then escorted to the Body Shop.  No one there ever heard of me.  I was escorted to the manager and I had had it.

Finally, they got the paperwork for the repairs on my vehicle.  I was given a loaner vehicle with, wait for it, a broken windshield.  They stated, 'We didn't have time to get it fixed'.  Honestly, what else can they do to alienate a customer?  This is ridiculous.  On top of that, I'm helping with their advertising efforts by driving a vehicle around with large letters that show their website address.  Who in the ^%$# wants to do that?!?!

"Came here on a busy Saturday evening. We didn't think ahead to make reservations for a table, but there were seats at the bar, which was just fine for us.

Between the two of us, we ordered the sweet and spicy cauliflower and three maki rolls - soft shell crab, spicy tuna, and the Kasa Moto (spicy scallop, lobster, and salmon). The cauliflower arrived relatively quickly, but it took the better part of an hour for the rolls to arrive. The cauliflower was pretty good - crispy and a good balance of spicy, sour, sweet, and salty - but a bit on the greasy side. The rolls, when they finally arrived, were nicely presented but they were average at best.

Service was relatively on the ball initially, but it fell off quickly. Nobody updated us on the status of our food until we asked (after almost 45 minutes) - at which point the server informed us that there was a party upstairs and, as a result. the kitchen was super backed up. What's more, some guy from the kitchen (maybe the expeditor?) apparently didn't like that our server had the gall to ask him a question and chewed him out in plain sight and within earshot of us for asking him.

I went to the rental car area at Sky Harbor Airport unsure of what line or area I should be in. There was a very long line waiting for 3 people at the counter to help them. Then there was 6 kiosk's for use as well. I was waiting in line and there were people in line talking about how easy the kiosk was to use and it was much quicker. I had already reserved on line and even paid for (I thought). So I moved to the kiosk area and talked to an agent on the screen who told me you are a gold member go ahead to the gold booth and get your vehicle. So I asked where the gold booth was and the man told me because I was a new gold member I had to wait in line to talk to a live agent. Who knew being in their elite club was a punishment :). So I got back in line and an hour and a half later yes that is right an hour and a half later I was talking to a live agent. During the time talking to him. he was trying to sell me insurance I didn't need and tried to make me feel bad for not buying it. When my husband asked how much for the insurance he talked about everything else but price, my husband again asked him the price and he again talked circles then my husband asked again the price then when he told us it was $180 I said that is almost more than the rental and he said well no the rental was $530. Now when I signed up on line it said if you pay today you will get this rental for $268 so I paid at that time for that price (or so I thought) so I told him that is not what I signed up for and he said that it what it was showing him. So I asked who I could talk to to get this straightened out and he said best not to rent and talk to supervisor. The supervisor was not available to help us right away and since it had already been over an hour and a half I just asked for the vehicle. He again tried to talk circles and I became very upset and hit the desk and asked for the vehicle. We were running very late to where we supposed to be and needed the vehicle. Then we went downstairs to find vehicle and basically had to help ourselves.

My girlfriend purchased her new 2014 Nissan Juke at the autonation on the i10 back in February because the autonation in Gilbert couldn't\/wouldn't give her the deal they had offer. Which is weird considering they are autonation and owned by each other? So we drove an extra 15 minutes for her to save a couple thousand which is fine. So my girlfriend had taken her juke in for a oil change and tire rotation on a Friday around 1:30pm. When I get home to check her car after work, the oil level was way past the full marker, secondly all four rims again are scratched terribly from the tech just jamming the lug nuts on and allowing the socket to rest on the holes. Causing deep scratches on all four wheels again this is the second time they have done this to her wheels but what pissed me off was they over filled the oil. I called that Friday evening after I had checked, even tho I knew the place was closed I left a message expecting a call first thing Saturday morning. No one calls and by Monday I called again to talk to my service adviser and she said she would call me back  when ""Bo"" the service manager let's her know what to do. Monday after noon I get a call back letting me know that ""Bo"" the service manager  had said there is no way I can prove they had overfilled the oil since the car was out of there shop since Friday and that they will contact me about the repairs for the wheels. Excuse me but why would anyone over fill there oil on purpose? Overall ""Bo"" just wanted to blame us and didn't want to rectify the problems his techs had done.

Three weeks ago, my girlfriend moved into an apartment managed by Award Realty. I cosigned her lease and the process of actually filling out the documents was pleasant and Robert (our contact) was very helpful and quick to answer any questions we had. Par for the course stuff.

A few days later, just before my girl moved in, I did a quick walk-through of the residence and noticed 2 problems: The sliding glass door was completely inoperable and the toilet in the hallway was running 247. I texted Robert and he quickly texted back and had a handyman call me. Nice. Not so bad right? Wait for it...

The next day I met the handyman early in the morning and he spent the next 3.5 (!) hours trying to get the door to work but was not able to, at least not fully. The slider now opens, but only shuts about 50% of the time, and when it does shut it's as a result of a tremendous amount of force being applied due to the rollers and the door itself just being completely shot. The handyman said he would order the parts and call me the next week (last week).

The handyman didn't call me. I called the handyman. No answer. I texted Robert. Twice. Nothing. I called and left a message on his phone. Twice. No reply.

We ordered the tempura calamari as an appetizer, which I totally recommend- it was the best thing we ate.  Lightly flash fried in sweet chili sauce, with a side of Napa cabbage, topped with peanuts and cilantro- this was perfectly balanced and tasty.  Unfortunately our entrees were .... well, I have to say that the closest thing I could compare them to is cafeteria food.  I ordered the steak.  A 12-ounce strip for $30.  The menu said it came with red wine sauce, maître d'hôtel butter, and duchess potatoes loaded with sharp cheddar cheese, bacon, chives, and sour cream.  I asked for no sour cream.  I got a steak with the maître d'hôtel butter as described, but it was also smothered in a thick, tomato based sauce.  Almost like a marinara.  and there was a lot of it.  It made the steak, which was already swimming in melted butter, pretty unappealing. Just a really weird flavor.  And the potatoes were basically mashed potatoes pressed into a ramekin and baked. No cheese- no bacon- no chives. Again- weird. My boyfriend's burger was supposed to come on a ""house-made cornmeal kaiser roll."" It came on a standard hamburger bun.  And for $11, it was a burger with lettuce, tomato, onion, and soft cheese spread (which lent the burger a strange gritty texture).  He only ate half of it due to the excessive char on the burger.  His fries were unremarkable and undercooked.  There are plenty of spots in Madison where a better burger and fries could be had for 7-10 bucks. Step it up, Avenue.

"My girlfriends and I got tickets at the last minute for this show on a discount ticket site online for about 60 a piece. Or seats were on the sides so the view wasnt the best but we got the jest of the show.  It is all about sex.  It is definitely for a mature person who doesnt mind some lewd acts but done in a sensual way.  The funniest parts were when they drew people from the crowd up on the stage. 

My favorite act were the two girls in the water filled bowl. Absolutely amazing.  Least favorite one was the girl in the bondage straps with the odd sounds. A little over the top imo.

"I've been here lots of times. Usually its a neutral experience.  I go in there knowing what i'm looking for, and spend a bit of time finding it, then pay for it, and leave.

This time i was going here to pick up a GE Smart water filter for my fridge. Not many places carry this filter, So i just save myself a headache and buy from Home Depot, and its not cheap!! Its a $53 filter!! 

So, i walk around looking for it, and found the shelves that carry the water filters.. don't see it.  I look at their fridges and found a GE, open it up and there is one in there.  So they still must sell it.  I finally find a female associate, and ask her about it, she asks me if i checked the shelves, i said Yes, she says.. well its only whats there...
I said, ok well you should carry it, cause i only buy from HomeDepot.  She asks me for a part number... i told here there is one in that fridge over there.  She checks the computer for stock levels, and it says there are 7 in stock.  She tells me that it may be in the back. I ask her how do i get one from the back? She says.. in the back means in the back stock room.. probably burried behind other stock. (she does not offer to find it) she checks the computer and tells me there is qty11  at Markham and Castlemore.  I said ok.. how do i know that those 11 are not ""the back"" too?  She says i can call them if i want. So i pull out my cell ( there is a phone right next to the computer she was using) and dial, using my cell minutes..  At this point, Canadian tire employees, Sport Chek and other stores offer to call and check to make sure its  there for me.  
I wasn't angry when i was there, but i thought about it after.  She should have made an attemp to go to the back and look for it. She should have used the store phone and call for me to check if its on the shelf, and not just on the computer there also.

So i drove home and jumped on the computer, as i write this review, i found a canadian company that sells OEM Ge water filters, that are much cheaper than Homedepot, and i also got free shipping, because i ordered qty2 !

Well, Home Depot will not be getting $53+taxes x2 = $121 per year, from me anymore !!!

Online purchasing is booming and will continue to, if stores like this have employees treat customers like this. I like to hold and see the product in my hand (old school style), but i didn't drive to their store just to walk around, and waste time, and leave empty handed and disappointed. Is phoning another location to check stock the employees job? I don't know.. but when they do it, i do appreciate it.

"Spare yourself and don't come here. Worst service and nail job I've ever received. It feels like a disorganized factory assembly line and you are just being squeezed in and pushed through. My nail technician left me in the middle of my appointment without saying a word to explain. She was gone for over 15min because she went to take a walk in who needed eyebrow waxing. I was in a hurry so I asked someone to help me. The guy dismissively told me not to worry then walked away. He finally came back and sloppily slapped nail polish on my nails and hands. When I asked him to fix it, he gave me attitude and basically said that I'm in a rush so this is what i get. Me being on a time constraint shouldn't mean that I should purposely get a bad job done!

The portions are super small compared to other South Asian restaurants, it's over priced, and has really inconsistent food. Last time we went our naan was burnt and Chicken Hara Masala tasted bitter.

I let the waitress know and she took my plate back and told me they were making a fresh order.I sat and watched my husband eat his food from begining to end. Mean while I sat and waited. Finally my food came out. I told the waitress it should be free. She told tha manager or supervisor what I said and when we recieved the bill 2.00 was deducted from the bill. I requested to speak to the person in charge about the situation and she took her time getting over to our table. I told her my food should be free since there was a problem with my order. She said to me that all she can do is take off 2.00. I told her that was poor customer service and she looked at me like I was crazy.

So a few months ago I saw a Groupon for the Legacy Golf Resort for the 4th of July weekend.  It was a great deal...$300 for a 4 night stay at a resort ($75 a night).  Now I know why it was such a deal.  Day one we check in.  My wife has to use the bathroom as soon as we get in. I tell you this because when she flushed the toilet, someone else's waste came back up and clogged the toilet.  The maintenance guy doesn't show up with a plunger, but a plumbers snake. Obviously, this is a reoccurring issue. We laugh it off and head to the pool.  Long day of traveling and the wife and I want a cocktail. The bar at the pool has a big sign that the system is down to charge to your room. Back to the room I go to get my wallet.  Then we go to the resort restaurant for a nice dinner.  My son ordered chicken wings which about the only good thing that arrived on our table. Every thing else was or appeared to be frozen food.  No charging to the room there either.

"8-14-16: this is one star for my experience today.  Went to have a cut and color.   I had Jose who was friendly, we went over my color choice, but after he applied my color I was left sitting in the lobby for 1hr+ until someone else finally came to shampoo me.  After a 2min Shampoo I got my cut.  When I got to my car I noticed all the hair dye around my hair line, I'm used to some hair dye but this was all of my hair line, my entire hair line, in my ears, and the entire back of my neck. When I got home I started to feel itching as well.  I called to speak to a manager but the person who answered wouldn't even identify herself as someone in charge, she just kept saying ""yes?"" So I told her my issue about the dye and the wait.  All she said was that dye around the hair line was normal that they don't get it all at the shampoo bowl, but she could ask someone what could help take it off.  I've had my hair colored before, and I never left with this much dye. I didn't even get to the itchy scalp! I grabbed astringent, aquaphor and 10 cotton balls later there is still a faint outline.  
I call to ask for help and they won't even let me talk to someone in charge so I could explain the whole situation, they just made it seem ambivalent. 
I don't know if Jose was having a bad day, or if he just didn't want to get dye on his white pants (what colorist wears white?) but he didn't do himself justice today. 
I have fine thin hair and to be left sitting with hair dye for over an hour has now given my scalp that numb burning feeling  I went to wash my hair tonight  and the entire tub was colored red.  They didn't wash out hardly any hair dye.

"Parents, I read reviews about this school prior to sending my children there and unfortunately brushed off some of the unfavorable experiences as being relative to each individual family. Back story: I was moving from another state where I had a great experience with Primrose. Naturally, it only made sense for me to go with Primrose here.   I enrolled my two children there and child 1 was pulled out after 2 weeks - as a result of being bullied.  To my dismay, the staff did nothing about the matter. For example, I often came to pick him up and he would be in tears -crying because kids were either mean to him or hitting him. When he came home with a black eye and no incident report was filed, I had enough.  I told management that they needed to address the bullying and I, of course, would need an incident report completed.  Well to my surprise, I received an incident report that my child was violent. I knew from how they handled the situation, this school was about covering their bottom line and this was not the place for my child.  (Thusly, child 1 would not return.)
 
I should have pulled my other kid out but finding daycare in Charlotte (especially south Charlotte) is very hard. I had him waitlisted at a school and thought we just had to make it 7 months and he would be enrolled at another daycare.  I witnessed numerous events wrongly handled by the administrative staff.  The teachers would openly talk about how they hated their job. They would even leave comments on social media trash talking the owners and other employees at the school.  When you see this type of behavior, it truly shows a disconnect within the leadership team and staff. 
 
We only made it three months there when we learned that child 2 had been slapped in his face by one of his teachers for spilling milk (BTW: he's 18 months and learning to drink out of a cup).  To add insult to injury, my child was slapped by a teacher, while another co-teacher looked on and did not report the incident to management. The same eyewitness-teacher only reported the incident when she witnessed her colleague slap another kid in the class. The matter that is truly appalling was that this event was reported to the administrative staff on a Friday at lunchtime. The teacher was fired, but no one informed me until the following Tuesday afternoon. As a daycare with integrity, you would think that they would want to inform the parent immediately. I believe the only reason they told me about the incident is because someone also reported the abuse to the state and it's hard to believe that it's only a coincidence that I received a call (the same) Tuesday afternoon, once the state had left.  I was also told by the investigator that she informed the daycare that if they did not call me to report the incident the state would.  The sheer lack of respect for my child, me as a parent and the overall integrity of the school is beyond disheartening.  
 
The state and the police are both investigating the incident and my child was pulled out of the school immediately.  Though the state is still investigating the school, they initially were given disciplinary violations and also a violation for not providing a safe environment for kids.
 
Unrelated to my situation, the school is now on administrative action by the State of NC Division of Child Development & Early Education for two incidents where staff members left kids on the playground unattended (they basically forgot kids outside).
 
I'm a big believer that culture in a business starts at the top. If the owners and administrators aren't doing their job to build a nurturing environment, then they won't attract\/maintain quality teachers.  Thus, everything trickles down to our kids and they are the individuals that bear the burden of a dysfunctional environment. 
 
There is a reason this daycare has available spots.  Call around to other daycares in South Charlotte and all the good ones are full. 

Please be sure to talk to parents in the community, read reviews and call the state for information on your school of choice for your children.  I wish I had paid more attention and researched even more about this facility. Do not make the same mistake that I did.

Completely not her fault, it was her first day and should have had a trainer helping her with orders. Finally, another girl with a terrible attitude took over and told me to pull to the window. After asking three different times to have chicken instead of beef she finally understood the question, and told me ""we don't have no chicken tacos. Only soy."" I asked her what soy meat was, and asked specifically if it had cow meat in it. She said it did not, only 'soy protein'. So I took the ""soy tacos"".

"Food was okay but it was just tacos.  You can't mess that up too bad. But, service was not good at all.  I ordered from the combo platos. Not plate mind you. You had your choice of two or three items. I said two tacos and held up the obligatory two fingers. She questioned my order. I again said two.  Then she then says ""dos tacos?"". Baffled I agreed, I wanted ""dos"" tacos. My husband ordered three tacos.  She didn't understand him at first because he said ""three"" and not ""tres"". Keep in mind, this entire conversation is in English by a very American bred waitress. And the sign outside says ""American-Mexican cuisine"".  Then I ordered a water that was filled zero times after I drank down the initial offering. Once we were done with our food we sat about 10 minutes before she came to ask if she could get us anything. The wait wasn't because she was busy, we were one of three customers in the dining area with three (tres) other wait staff working. So all we wanted was the check at that point.  As we walked out to leave we did see all the wait staff sitting on the patio chatting.",0.0

"Been here a few times to get some food. It's an ok place to eat occassionally and their prices might be a bit more expensive than some other asian\/chinese cafes\/restaurants but its bearable. Maybe a couple dollars more? They do offer some combos but that only really means you get a hot drink along with your meal. Getting a cold drink means an additional fee of 50 cents or so.

Food quality is actually not bad. I've tried their baked clams, cheese and mushroom rice\/spaghetti dish which was quite good and tasty. I've also had a few of their Yunnan Vermicelli varieties like the shredded pork with preserved vegetables, fish fillet in fish broth and fish fillet in spicy fish broth; all of which I found quite tasty as well. The serving size is a good portion too so it definitely fills!

Serivce has been decent so far but I prefer coming during the day time because the servers seem to care more. Well, they were females...no offense guys! When I came during the day for either take out or eating in, service was fine. I came one time in the evening and was served by a guy who forgot to give me a menu.

I had the black tonkatsu which is tonkatsu with black garlic oil (not squid ink).  The MSG level isn't too bad, just a slight numbness for me.  It seems more like one of the ingredients or mixes they had used had MSG.  Much like Casa Manila used to have in their tamarind soup (sinigang).

The waitress we had had a ""perky attitude"" which is why I actually enjoyed my time there and wait as well.  The eggs were the way I liked them on my ramen.  The noodles were aldente'd just right.

The pool during the week is great, lots of places to eat, and good gambling outcomes. I did have a few issues this summer, however. I arranged for self check in before I arrived, yet the kiosk told me that my room was not ready- at 7pm on my check in date, so I had to wait in line to check in at the desk- at which time, they alert me that the room I had reserved was not available, so I wouldnt have a view. We did like our retro room, however, 3 of their elevators were not working, so there was a significant wait at certain times of the day to get to or from our room. The day we were checking out, I wasnt feeling well, so I called and asked if I could have some extra time to check out- the concierge said they were not doing any late check outs- then I kindly reminded them of my 3 hours of late check in when I arrived, so she said she would give me an hour.

First off, we go to the hostess, ask for a table for two, and they say it'll be a 20 minute wait and they'll text us when the table is ready. Cool, no problem. We walk around Casa Paloma for a while and then 25 minutes pass without hearing anything. We head back to Z Tejas only to see a large party in front us walking in and immediately being seated. We ask the hostess when we could expect to be seated and lo and behold they find a table for us right away. Once we sit down, I look at the menu and see that the cornbread, which has always been free in the past, now costs $3. Not a big deal but still a bit chintzy in my opinion. We ask the waiter when the change happened and he says ""December 1st. Were you guys planning on just snacking on cornbread and hanging out?"" The rudeness of this statement and the implication that accompanies it stuns me. Believe it or not, just because I'm younger doesn't mean I don't plan on spending money for a decent dinner.

Instantly I panicked, stopped Lisa and asked her what she was doing.  She told me she was doing and undercut.  Wow that's strange, I don't remember even an ounce of a discussion about an undercut.  She had mid length hair and simply wanted a trim to her shoulders.  Even a child can understand those directions.  After back and forth discussion about figuring out what the heck to do, she complained to the manager that she cannot proceed with daughter's cut because of miscommunication.  Um no miscommunication, I gave simple instructions.  She was ridiculously rude and does not listen.  My daughter immediately started crying because she cut it so short and as a mom, that has to be the worst feeling.  I was told she had years of experience but if that was the case, I would have received an apology, my daughter an apology and a plan to try to fix it.

Unfortunately, the brakes didn't improve over time, so we called them several days later to swap the car. They told us they had two new Camry's to swap with and to bring it in and we could swap with one of those. When we got there (an hour later), the girl at the stand (after taking two phone calls while we were waiting) said that they only had a smaller car that they could give us, and couldn't give us one of the Camry's as they were reserved. She thought the brakes might be ""dusty"" without checking the vehicle, even though we told her they were squeaking consistently and loudly. So we drove all that way from North Scottsdale based on the phone call only to leave with the same vehicle. She really didn't care that the brake linings might need replacing, or about our experience driving around town annoying people with the brakes.

"There has been a lot of talk about this place. Several yelpers came here and it was closed either because they were out of noodles or machine breakdown (or both). Some good and bad yelp reviews....finally I've decided to try it myself. 

I didn't know that this place shares the same space with another restaurant. I got lost on 1st Street and finally found my way here. Basically, you order your food at the counter and you can sit wherever you want when the food is ready. I ordered it to go and it comes with a container that is sealed super tight. That is important especially when you need to bring it back few blocks back to work. I could see some nice bowls that they use if you choose to dine in. The kitchen is clean and the cashiers are super nice. 

Since I didn't know what to order, I picked the first item on their menu, Shio Tonkotsu ($7.50 before tax). I'll be honest, their broth was a little blend and salty. But the meat is generous and the noodle is delicious. For drinks, I ordered their mango flavor soda ($3 per bottle) that is imported from Japan. A bit pricy but it was worth every penny. It has a strong mango flavor but not overly sweet. I'll definitely buy that again. My co-worker ordered a Miso Togayaski and it looks much more delicious than mine. The sauce is thicker and it even has an egg in it. She also told me their potsticker is very delicious.

When I was there last Saturday (well before the dinner rush), we sat for 20 minutes with no service.  We were looking forward to trying a specific beer on the menu (which we had to get ourselves), but if we couldn't even place an order in 20 minutes, we did not want to know how long it would take to get our drinks and then pay our bill.

"So my wife and I thought we would try someplace new tonight. I purchased a $26 for $40 Groupon and we headed to Swish. It's a cook your own food\/sushi restaurant. The waitress kept trying to talk me into their main dish, shabu shabu. I wanted some salmon sushi but for some reason they couldn't make it. They brought my wife a roll with salmon, but no salmon sushi for me. I think it was because of the Groupon. They want you to order only high profit items to make up for the discount. The waitress was not helpful and difficult to communicate with. I finally ordered the shabu shadu.  It was supposed to be 8oz of meat but I think they skimped on that too, because of the Groupon. The food was boring and unsatisfying. I think a teriyaki bowl from Samuri Sams would have been better. Finally, when we received our bill for $3 in tax, the waitress said she wouldn't accept my credit card because it was under the $10 minimum, for which they had no signs posted. Very disappointing.

"Bagel expert from NY reporting that these bagels are smaller, but still a good eat. They fall somewhere below my favorite Valley place, but are worthy if your in the area. I grabbed eight at a buck apiece and they have all the trendy flavors, including cornmeal and cheddar, etc. The place is tiny, but the price of a sandwich is large. At least $10.50 for nearly every sandwich. They don't use Boars Head, nor do they make their own meat and the photos of the sandwiches look small, so they must be charging North Scottsdale prices.

"After a couple other mediocre experiences here, my wife and the 3 kids decided to give this place another go.  We were immediately put off by the fact that every table had a tablet type device intruding on our table.  My wife instantly joked that we were going to need 3 of those things before seriously asking if we could have it removed from our table to which the answer was ""no, sorry.""  Hmmmm.  We have no choice but to be forced to eat with our family with this tablet thing with marketing messages, games, etc staring at us.  Just nothing I really care about when I go out to eat dinner with my family.  I go out to get away from those things actually.  That alone is enough for me to not go back.  Technology is cool and all, but this is just plain intrusive.  I really felt sorry for the two tops.  The things are pretty significant in size and are just plain awkward if you ask me.  

The two burgers we got weren't bad but certainly didn't justify the price tag.   Specifically asked for a cheeseburger for our 5 year old daughter.  When it came out without cheese, we paged the server with our annoying tablet, and when she came back we explained that the burger was supposed to have cheese.   She apologized and said she would fix it and left the burger with us and headed for the kitchen.  I wrongly assumed that she would be bringing out a new burger with cheese (like we ordered).  However when she returned with a cold slice of cheese on a plate, we were so surprised that we just laughed it off.  At that point, no need to complain to anyone else.

Okay, you may like or dislike this Uncle Tetsu's branch depending on what your expectations of a Japanese Cheesecake are.

Do you want a cheesecake that's at least on par with the downtown Tetsu branch? You'll like it here.

Do you want to be served by actual Japanese employees, similar to the downtown branch? You won't find it here; all the employees inside while I was ordering spoke Cantonese or Mandarin.

Regardless, the offerings for this branch are similar to the downtown one, with a few new additions. For example, I didn't remember seeing a devil hat cake or the dutch chocolate angel hat cake in the downtown branch. I also didn't remember them having a wide assortment of ice cream options, as well as a good variety of madeleines.

I found the taste of the cakes exactly the same as the downtown location, which indeed is excellent. However the organization of this store needs work...it wasn't made obvious that there's a separate line for purely non-cheesecake orders.

When I was signing my paperwork for the service of my car, I saw that my name was misspelled and he didn't bother to correct my name. Then I went to get my loaner car and the lady upfront was accusing me of not having full coverage on my vehicle and was not going to let me get a loaner car even though I GAVE her my insurance card. Lady - it's not my problem if you don't know how to call my insurance company to ask if I do in fact of full coverage on my vehicle. It is not my responsibility to call my insurance company and have them tell you that I DO pay for full coverage on my car. She gave then gave me attitude and was expecting me to pull up my insurance coverage through my phone. Finally, she just said ""whatever"" and had me sign the paper to get a loaner car. Then she got up and started walking outside and didn't even ask me to follow her. I assumed she wanted me to follow her so I did and she just handed me my keys and I left. I will never come here again. Later that afternoon, Alan called me and told me that they are going to replace my battery and that it was going to be ""X"" amount.

"I'd just arrived in Inverness and after checking in went venturing about for something to enjoy.    I came across this cute restaurant not far from our hotel.  Thought it was worth a looksie.   When I entered with my husband we were asked if we had a reservation.  As it appeared to be somewhat vacant (one table in the rear full and one couple near the front) I didn't realize we needed one.  A bit begrudgingly, the hostess sat us at a double table without much indication of which half of this seating we were to sit on.  After a bit of further guidance, we got our menus, our ""proper"" seating, and our drinks.  I had a local cider, Thistle Cider, and my hubs enjoyed a local IPA.  It took sometime to get our order taken as it appeared only one person was taking orders despite the two other gals walking about.  

Our food was delicious, which raised the level of stars for this review.  I had a chicken pasta with a Parmesan cheese sauce.  My husband had their rump steak.  Both were prepared perfectly.  I loved that they used a dumb waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen.  During the middle of our meal, a rather large group of locals entered and took up the seats by the door.  They had the door closed for them, which I must say was the beginning of the end of our joyful time here.  By the look of them, we knew they had some power as regulars here.  In the next few minutes the temperature began to mount,  By the time we finished our meal we were sweating and fanning ourselves with brochures from our pockets.  We asked for dessert to go, but were told they do nothing ""take away"".  I do also want to note that their dessert is on just one chalk board and must be moved around to each table based on need.

"Well it sounds like other people have had good experiences here over all.  NOT ME!  Guess I just looked like a sucker when I walked in the door.  I had a right side xenon bulb out.  I walked out having paid a total of $194 after brining my own lights to change.  Alex kept justifying it by the labor.  I also WAY overpaid for a pair of LED turn signal bulbs and a supposed bad ballast which I'm questioning at this point cuz I was WAY overcharged and feel cheated in every way.   I paid the $194 that day because I was there and just wanted it done.  Three days later I went back because now somehow my left light refuses to want to act right.  I went in asking them to look at it but Carlos was already mentally rubbing his hands together giggling saying probably the left ballast I know it sucks but I see it all the time. He said he'd have to charge me $60 just to diagnose which not only should a diagnosis be free- especially since I just gave him $194 the week before.  That sent a red flag up telling me that at this corrupt business they are ripping people off.  I understand a business in it to make a profit but these people are straight screwing people by overcharging.  So what do I do?? Go pay another $200 to have a  few $6 parts put on in an excessive amount of time.  That's the other issue I encountered.  I had major problems with their time estimate and spoke with another customer outside who was also angry that they had his car since 10 am and it was now nearing 6pm.  He said ""Ive been here 3 times now and they definitely are horrible about either taking on too much work or guesstimating what time they will be finished he said he would not be back and I think I'll follow suit.   On the day I was there I was told I'd definitely be out of there by 5 o'clock instead by 6:15 I was already over an hour late. Seriously though- just gave them $194 worth of business for several $5-6 parts he put on my car plus the bulbs that I provided.  The last thing bothering me is that when Alex through his sales pitch on the turn signal bulbs, he did explain that if I didn't buy his overpriced load resistors for $60 installed that my turn signal bulbs would blink at double the blinker speed..  I went to war mart and found the same part for $8 for my turn signal bulbs so they would blink at the normal blinker speed.  He DIDN'T explain that without the resistors it would mess up the car's computer in time.  When I returned with my own better quality looking resistors I asked how much to have them installed (very easy procedure from what I understand but I'm not the least bit mechanically inclined making me once again potentially easy prey for the price gouging criminals). Carlos quoted me $60 to DIAGNOSE even though thats what he charges to install his own part and all. He tried to rob me on that by saying it would take an hour to mount them- that's where I got really offended and kept thinking ""who raised this crooked dude""?  I already warned two friends one wanting LED tail lights the other wanting Led accent lighting all throughout his Vette when they asked how things went at VEGAS HID.  I told them that they can expect to be without your vehicle  at least double the amount of time promised and you might wanna take a jar of Vaseline with you as they don't provide when they hand you the bill. I understand how business works and they are in it to make a profit but as far as an ethical business who appreciates their customers this isn't the place.

Update:  over a year later I STILL feel the same!  In fact, the work that was done at Vegas HID did not hold up well. I DID end up having to have my left bulb replaced but stayed FAR away from this place that hopefully the BBB shuts down. I found an even better place- a shop that does car Audio. These guys knew more about a car's wiring systems than Carlos and all his amateurs combined. So my best advice in all I've learned- if you want ANY kind of LED or xenon work done on your car, call around to well rated car AUDIO shops and ask for an honest quote over the phone. One last thing to add about the illegals at Vegas HID- I can't prove it but I'm almost SURE (can't prove it) that Alex broke something in my right headlight lens. Up until that day my xenon bulb and it's connector wiring will NOT properly snap back into the lens.  The day Alex was working on it he kept sending other people out to tell me it'd be just a few minutes (turned into 90 extra minutes!) because he was allegedly holding some kind of adhesive in place until it dried. He didn't tell the likely true that he was gluing some important connector piece that he broke. Again can't prove that last part but it's what it sure looks like. The honest people in Reno who did know what they were doing pointed that out to me. Time is usually the best test. If over s year later I still have a poor opinion of this place then my review of them must be dead on!!!",0.0

However, the service is actual crap. A big steaming pile of it. 

I think just for us to get one beer while sitting AT THE BAR took a good 15 minutes after placing our order. Then we got to wait another 20 for a water that I asked for and for our food orders to be taken. Mind you, the bar itself had maybe 7 people sitting at it. Additionally, when I told the waitress I just wanted a Coors Light (please, don't give me shit - let's save that for another time. I know it's piss water), she looked at me and smirked and goes, ""Okay. Well. We don't have that, so. We have Bud Light."" Okay, GIRL, there are about a million other NICE WAYS you could've worded that. Nobody asked for your smirk or attitude around here, so I don't know who you're talking to with that tone.

I wasn't too hungry when we came here but I knew I needed to eat something. So, I ordered the appetizer guacamole & chips.

She also ordered a soy latte in a mug. It was served extremely hot and the milk was burned so she asked for another. We watched the guy make it with real milk and without a thermometer in the milk. How does he know if he isn't burning the milk if he isn't using a thermometer? These are standard at all Starbucks and most coffee shops. He delivered the latte and when we asked if it was soy he said he was ""pretty sure"" so we pointed out the gallon of milk he used and asked if that was soy. He didn't really have an answer for us and took the drink away. We got a refund from the apathetic manager\/cashier.

We were served our dishes silently by the same guy that made the latte who turned around to do something else leaving me to get up to find silverware and napkins. I get that it's a ""seat yourself"" place but napkins and silverware should be provided. 

I ordered the short rib sandwich and sweet potato chips. It was all very greasy and while I admit that I ordered the sandwich without onions and cheese, the flavor left a lot to be desired. A Korean BBQ sauce or glaze would have made it perfect. The bread was very greasy as well but it was delicious which raises my review from 1 to 2 stars. I believe they get it from Noble Bread. 

Our overall takeaway was that this place doesn't care about their customers. They were annoyed with our questions about the menu. They didn't pay attention to the coffee order and come on, ""pretty sure"" it's soy?? That is not the answer. Know what you're serving your customer. And give your customers silverware and napkins. We felt like our presence was an inconvenience to the FOH staff and will not be returning.",0.0
"Dropped by Sweet India on a whim. The upgraded branding was clean and very well done as was the decor. We ordered two thalis with the two meat and one veggie selection platter. Both platters had butter chicken and goat curries as the meat selections. This is where it kind of went down hill...For the price we paid up front the portion size was minuscule! The server carefully laid out two tiny slivers of chicken in the butter chicken gravy as well as two slivers of goat meat in the goat curry. When I asked to add another piece, the server replied, ""Oh I've given plenty, that's all that comes with this."" I've visited plenty of mom and pop based Indian and Middle Eastern eateries and they've always accommodated. The gall of this server was unexpected. Overhearing our conversation and as the next platter was being prepared by the second server, she was nice enough to add a few extra pieces of meat to the already scarce platter. The food was tasty for the most part but the service left a bad taste in our mouth. The place serves takeout services for samosas, sweets and other savouries - we had plans of picking a few items up. However with the hefty bill we paid for the tiny morsels of food. It just wasn't worth it. We'll be avoiding this place.",0.0

Sorry Shoku but I was more than disappointed after trying out the Spicy Miso Ramen. Prior to ordering I asked the server if the Ramen comes with bamboo if not I'll add it to the order in which he said it does. The first thing I noticed when it came out was it didn't have the bamboo we talked about. It took almost an hour wait for them to finally bring out my bowl or Ramen. The broth was eh the corn was hard and the mushroom had an after taste to it. The terrible service and bad food definitely will keep me from coming back.,0.0

"I went twice, based on the reviews. The first time I had pad Thai which was a 6.5 at best. Nothing special & very small portion for $10. The cashier\/hostess\/waitress had a very bad attitude & I was simply doing takeout. I shook it off & decided to try it again but dine in. I had the panang curry. Two things wrong with this: 1st she brought out a bowl of rice for the entire table to share, strike one. 2nd she brought the curry out on a plate so I had to scrape the little that I did have onto my shared portion of rice. On top of that the same hostess was walking around with the same stank attitude. Clearly, it's time for her to find another job. Oh & the curry was maybe a 5 at best.

"Hooters is a great place. I would bring my family here, truly. The women at this hotel are probably more fully clothed than other places in Vegas!

"I ended up entering the mall as a detour. It started raining outside as I was making my way towards the Treasure Island Hotel. I was so close...! I like checking out the hotels along the strip while in Las Vegas.  Always a sightseeing must! This was one of two hotels I haven't yet made it to.

The mall had its usual shops and eateries.  It was nice to see an indoor ""gondola ride"" with singing ""oarers"". This part of the mall was decorated in such a way as if in Venice, complete with various Italian themed eateries. Touristy for sure but still nice.

"I hate to leave a negative review of a Donino's franchise as I've been a loyal customer for over three decades. However, this was THE worst Domino's I've ever had by far. Ive had cafeteria pizza back in the 70s better than this. It was like eating a manhole cover. New to the area, on a Tuesday June early evening, we chose this franchise last night as its closest to my temporary McQueen\/Guadalupe residence in Gilbert while listing my house for sale, downsizing. The franchise at Val Vista\/Warner arguably has the best Domino's pizza I've ever tasted... always fresh, soft, buttery crust - phenomenal staff and management. This locale was the exact OPPOSITE. Two pizzas on the $5.99 large 2-item  carry out special: Mushroom\/Sausage for me and Canadian Bacon\/Pepperoni for my friends. The mushrooms were like rubber and what little sausage that was on it was nuked. Their pizza was no better... even after I added pineapple chunks to bring out more flavor. The Canadian bacon was like plastic and the pepperoni was like jerky. The crust on both pizzas was like baked cardboard - my Labradoodle had a hard time eating it. Lol. It honestly was inedible and unsatisfactory, ruining a nice evening. I called the measly-sounding manager who was the one who made it and he matter of factly said he'd give me $15 off my next order - and I'm like... order of WHAT??? It sure as hell won't be pizza, cuz he doesn't know how to make it - and only a corporate overhaul could improve it. I guess pasta as that's hard to screw up - lol, but as inept as this place seems to be from others on my Facebook validating, I'm thinking I will just drive an extra 7-10 minutes each way to my old neighborhood franchise. Unless there is new management, this place is doomed and completely not representational of Domino's quality - or a gas station's pizza quality, for that matter. I'll pass, thanks. Avoid until you see the ""under new management"" sign. Sorry, but if Yelp had a zero-star option, I'd use it, because a 1-star is entirely too generous.",0.0

"Stoned-N-Baked is the latest new kid in town as Container Park continues its process of becoming a well-rounded micro community of shops and restaurants. A perfect addition to the offerings already present; in fact, Stone-N-Baked compliments another one of my favorites in the Park: Oak & Ivy. Do they deliver? Yes friend, they'll deliver that pie straight to your bar stool. 

My interaction here was brief, but I saw their ad a few days before about a soft opening on the 23rd, and being on the hunt for excellent nearby slices, in I went.

"came here last minute after having drinks at the Golden Tiki, when we walked in around 7p there were a lot of people waiting but a LOT of open tables available.  I understand if maybe there aren't enough servers to wait on the tables then there's no point to seating guests who'll just be waiting for someone to come around, maybe they were short tonight who knows.  Anyway, we noticed there were just enough seats at the bar for our party of 6 so we asked the hostess if we could just sit at the bar, she said she would have to ask the chefs, ""Ok"".  She proceeded to look at her list of people waiting and after several minutes someone from my group takes it upon herself to go to the sushi bar to see if we can sit there (since it needed to be ok by the chefs) the chefs then said, you need to check with the hostess.  So here we are, with plenty of tables open, enough seats for our party at the sushi bar, hostess needs approval from the chefs, chefs need approval from the hostess, and no one wanting to seat us.  When we finally get the approval to sit at the bar, a server comes over and takes our drink orders.  It takes a while for someone else to come by and take our actual food orders for appetizer and things from that need to be ordered from the kitchen, after ordering and receiving some of my items from the sushi chefs in front of me, i realize we still haven't received our drinks.  To make a long story short, the service was kind of all over the place, it took forever for someone to come by with the check when we were finally done the food was just ehh.  Most of the nigiri I ordered was covered in sauce and the the appetizer I ordered (sashimi bibimbap) was just ok, kinda bland.

Really nothing to complain about for this place. The food was good and it was ready when they said it would be. My reason for giving three stars is because I feel three is average.

"My experience with this company has been spotty at best. Although we now have an awesome tech, Craig, who has been able to slow down our scorpion problem, my complaint is with the termite dept. We paid to have the whole house treated a couple of years ago, so we are still under warranty. But we have had to have the house spot treated more times than I can count.
Jason, the inspector assigned to us, was nice to begin with, but now his ""solution"" to the problem is to up sell us on a whole new treatment. He said to spot treat is basically just putting a band aid on the problem. To me, that is telling us they can't fix the issue. To emphasize how bad it has gotten, we recently found evidence of previous infestation in our wood floor. There is a nice gash by a stem wall. Jason said nothing there now, but the damage has been done.
I  him if I have to pay to have the whole house treated again, I might as well find a company that can actually get rid of the termites. At this point he got very lackadaisical about the whole thing, and acted like he was just glad to not have to deal with a problem his company seemingly cannot fix. Tomorrow, I will be searching for a new pest control company.",0.0

I went back to the counter to ask and the cashier had no idea what I was talking about. No one actually gave our order to the kitchen staff.  No apologies.   Food finally came out about 10 minutes later. It's now been approximately 40 minutes since we ordered 2 bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches and a order of French toast.

"$5 piercings sounds like a good deal but sketchy at the same time. 
Let's put it this way, YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR. 
I got two piercings from this place and the first one was for my Tragus and the second on my cartilage. 

**INFO: They pierce with a needle and then slide the piercing in. Once they are done, you bleed a lot for some reason which I've never seen piercings bleed so much before, (I've gotten my nose, belly, and cartilage at other places). Also, the piercing they use is a long piercing. So it hurts so much because it gets caught on things and I have to be extra careful not to lay or bump it, which is hard since it sticks out. 

Staff wasn't too friendly, seems as if they just go to work to work, which I know a lot of people do but at least pretend. 
And CASH ONLY, they will not give you your change and they will convince you to give the change as a Tip. I understand tipping is a nice gesture but tipping is earned not just given.

"I had Dr Toledo as my Doctor for my 2nd child and this is the only reason why I wanted to go back to him for my 3rd child. 2 weeks ago I came in for an appnt to confirm my pregnancy, the result came back positive saw Dr Plotnitkskiy and was advised I needed to get some blood works done and come back in 2 weeks since I was only 5 and half weeks and they couldn't hear my baby's heart beat. Prior to scheduling my 2nd visit I asked their front desk to verify if I had to pay a $50 co pay each visit cuz it didn't sound right to me and I was advise yes. I then called my insurance to verify this and I was advise by my insurance that I only needed to pay one time copayment of $50 and rest of my visit will be billed to my insurance. My appnt finally came around and before heading to the office I called and spoke to the front desk girl name Mylene and told her my situation and that I needed to speak to their billing dept before heading to their office. She told me that person that handles billing is the girl name crystal. When I spoke to Crystal she tells me she doesn't
Handle billing. To avoid getting bounced back and forth I called my insurance again and have them speak directly to Crystal where they advised her I don't need to pay anymore copay, crystal told us that there's another dept that handles that and that she would contact them for me. Long story short i never got a call from what they call billing dept so I decided to go in there and see the doctor and I was referred to a clinic manager name Holy. This Holy girl never came out to talk to me and they wouldn't let me see Dr Toledo unless I pay $50 copay. I was forced to pay that just so I can see him to let him know what's going on with his staff. As I get called they put me in the room and had a nurse check my blood pressure and tells me undress myself from the waste down as they would do a Pap smear. I waited for another 30 minutes and then finally Dr Toledo comes in the room. As I was explaining to him what I was upset about Holy walks in the room without introducing herself and starts explaining the billing situation to me, and then tells Dr Toledo to get out of the room as what I'm complaining about doesn't concern him. When Dr Toledo left the room I was calmly explaining to Holy the Situation and she tells me
She has no time to look at the billing and talk to me and at this point she would rather lose a patient. This really got me furious as I couldn't believe how rudely she came in the room kicks Dr Toledo out and practically tells me to leave while I'm half way naked! No respect at all! I'm telling her can you first of all let me get dress and then she should talk to me then she walks out of the room and told me to leave and that she doesn't need to talk to me anymore.

My appointment was scheduled for 4:50pm 4 weeks in advance. 1 week prior I was called to ask if I could move my appointment to 4:20, which I did. I left work early to make this appointment time. Upon arrival, I stood in line to check in for several minutes. I then checked in and left a urine sample as requested and sat down among a crowded waiting area.

"Well today i walked over to papa christos hoping that it was finally open again and it was. The place was closed for a while for renovation.  The new image looks good and now you can get your own refills. I usually order a sandwich although i some times take advantage of the pizza deal. The menu has changed and some of the great sandwiches are not listed anymore. This place has always been on the top of my list for affordable places to eat downtown, and being a family owned and operated restaurant quality is usually high. I ordered the Italian chicken pesto which is one of my favorites and well i was disappointed. I understand that the prices were up to pay for the renovation but the quality is also paying the price. The sandwich was a noticeably smaller the bread was not a ciabata bread that its usually served over and the chicken portion was less that ussual. It had a different taste in all. Maybe they are using cheaper ingredients i dont know. Needless to say i hope they really reconsider to keep the food quality and quantity if they are raising the prices.

"Pretty disappointing, especially with all the positive reviews.

Husband and I came here on a Saturday night, and with the crowd huddling around outside near the front entrance, we were excited to dine! Plus our tummies were growling at us, exclaiming, ""FEED ME! FEED ME!""

Surprisingly, the wait wasn't very long. In total, we waited about 15 minutes. They gave us a handy pager.

Glancing the menu, we remarked at how expansive it was and how many offerings there were. Normally when we come across restaurants that offer such a variety, we are little more cautious in the food quality and preparation, but given all the great reviews, we didn't think this would be an issue.

So here are where things went wrong:

1. We saw our table being bused, and the waitress who was clearing it off used the same rag that had been in a used bin off near the hostess stand. Mind you, it was in clear view sight from all customers and us (waiting at the time). Cringe-worthy I tell you.

2. Barley tea was complimentary and a nice gesture, but not even seeped properly or hot. We requested another pot, and the it was the same result.

3. When we inquired about ordering a tekka maki (which is tuna roll), the waiter didn't know what we were referring to. We saw on their menu that they had tuna with cucumber, and tuna with avocado. We just wanted a simple tuna roll, and this was the first place that we've encountered that not only didn't offer it, but didn't know what it was. Yikes.

4. Gyoza that we ordered was beef, and the wrapper was off in thickness, and there was this overwhelming sweet sauce doused all over it on the skillet. It had an off-putting after taste, so combined with that and the texture of the wrapper, the dish was not appetizing.

5. Our salads and soups were not bad. Refreshing for the salad, and good dressing. Soup was hot, but not enough texture with wakame, tofu, or even mushrooms.

6. Tempura udon that we ordered was served in the korean stone pot, and lots and lots of veggies. Yummy variety, but the soup base was lukewarm and one note - TOO SWEET. Once again, the peeled carrot on the gyoza appeared in the soup as well. On the positive side, the tempura was good - batter light and flaky, good variety, sweet and moist shrimp.

7. Sashimi dinner was not very good either. The cuts of fish were not properly cut, and even some of the fish choices looked past their due date, so a good portion of the plate we weren't able to eat. Salmon pieces were not flavorful, and the one we look forward to most, TUNA, had not an ounce of tuna flavor! The only piece that was delicious was the smoked whitefish, octopus, and yellowtail. At $31 CAD, we would want to have the utmost freshness in our sashimi. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.

Staff was pleasant, but nothing out of this world. Perhaps their udon and sashimi aren't their strong points, and we might have had a better experience had we ordered their rolls, but I'm not so sure we'd take a gamble to find that out. Onto the next sushi adventure!",0.0

I came to Vegas for the weekend to meet up with some girl friends. Before coming to Vegas we decided we wanted to dine at a nice restaurant to celebrate. We chose Andre's after looking through Yelp ratings. None of us had ever been here before, so we didn't know what to expect. I mean, given the 4 dollar signs and the 4+ rating it *should* be good... Right?

Nope.

The entire experience was underwhelming - from arriving at the restaurant to receiving the check, the entire process left something to be desired.

AMBIANCE: 3.5\/5
I was surprised by how small the dining room of the restaurant was. We had made a reservation a week prior to arriving at the restaurant, so I was a little taken aback when we were seated at a 4-person table right in the middle of the tiny dining room. Throughout the night, I saw that tables\/booths at the periphery of the restaurant were empty. Given that they weren't busy, I can't imagine why they put us in such an awkward table position. The decor seemed dated... tired-looking, almost. It was almost kitsch.

SERVICE: 3.5\/5
Given the type of restaurant I was being served in I had expected more of the service staff. They seemed to have done the bare minimum required of a restaurant like this, which means it wasn't enough. Like what some of the other reviewers said, the service was attentive but rough around the edges. One waitress took away our forks and knives right after another server had set them down (for our meat entrees). They also made a big mistake ($150+!) on our check, which we had to correct.

FOOD: 3\/5
Alas, the food. I was thoroughly disappointed in the food. Three of us ordered the 5-course tasting, while one person did a-la-carte. Overall, the food was way too SALTY. There was not a single dish where we did not do a double take on just how salty the food was. In addition to being too salty, the flavors were just plain unimpressive. I had the soup of the day (chilled creamy artichoke), crab meat ravioli, duck breast, lamb chop, and the Grand Marnier souffle. The texture of the meats were good, but because of how salty everything was I wasn't able to truly appreciate the food. Andre's souffles are supposed to be good, but really I found them to be just all right.

     I was very excited to see the event posting because of my passion and love for 80's New Wave music. I invited others to go to this event because we saw the great music layout.
When we first arrived, we heard some great music playing and saw the old music videos playing. 
     After about the 4th song, the music and energy excitement went down hill. 
DJ Tristan started playing ""radio versions"" of the old music. The most frustrating part is when I started watching him DJ...he spent most of his time picking out cd's out of his CD book. No B-sides, No WaxTrax, Dubmixes... or pretty much ANY remixes were played. A DJ myself for many years, I was getting frustrated that he didn't bridge or fade his music well.

"We saw all the high ratings, and gave it a try.  We thought it was more of a German Restaurant-Pub. It turned out to be a bar, with very uncomfortable seating and
some ""German"" themed foods.  Both me and my Stepdad were very disappointed.  My food has no seasoning, tasted gross  and was cold.   There was no salt or pepper anywhere  to be seen,  and
the overworked bartender was serving all the alcohol in the place, while trying but failing,  to provide service to those eating in the bar area.  The so-called German potato salad was fingerling potatoes, cabbage, bacon bits and mustard seed, without any dressing or flavor other than the heavy smoke of the bacon, that I could detect.  I couldn't get the over-smoked bacon taste out of my mouth for hours.  The food is way overpriced for what you get.  My Stepdad tried to talk to the bartender about the four German draft beers on thier list, and was pretty much blown off, if not insulted.  He was told one beer he mentioned wasn't even a German beer, in no uncertain terms with a snotty tone.  The bartender was more in a hurry to get back to talking to his tatooed twenty-something pals sitting at his bar, than to welcome us or help us select a beer.   The food took a very, very long time to come out, and I had to take my card up to the bar to finally get  a check and get the heck out of there.  We were never asked how we liked the beer or the food.  I have no idea what some see it this place.  To me it was lousy food, lousy service, with an arrogant attitude and very uncomfortable.  We haven't enjoyed a meal less in a very long time.",0.0
"Touchdown!? Errr... I have zero love for the actual game of golf, but get me in a driving range and I'm having a blast. Topgolf is truly the ultimate driving range with multiple targets within the range that capture your yardage and speed. 

4 levels high, this massive play house is balls of fun! You enter on the second level where you check-in. We got super lucky, as I have heard many a horror story about the massive weight times. I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND calling ahead. We waited about 10 minutes and then received a text that our golf bay was ready. Prices are per hour and vary by the time you arrive and which level you would like to be on, obviously nighttime and the higher levels are more mula! There is also a one-time $5 per person for a Topgolf Lifetime Membership. I'm in the club, baby!!  The 4th level is a private event space with a private pool. We opted for the 3rd level because YOLO. The 3rd level has a private bar and a pool. This level is cool because it can please a whole crowd, some can be at the pool and some can be at hitting balls-- you can easily go back and forth. Typically the pool on level 3 is $30\/person to use, but if you are spending mad money at your table and it isn't CRAZY busy at the pool-- they are pretty cool about letting you in. There is about 6 cabanas surrounding the pool that you can rent, 3 of which ""overlook"" Wet Republic. 

Similar to bowling, your group gets their own ""lane."" They call it a ""golf bay,"" I like to call it a golf cabana because it sounds fancy. We had 5 people, but I think you could fit 8-10 in a lane. Your golf cabana contains 2 TVs (one with your golf scores + one with sports), a sectional couch, a table, space to put your own clubs, the Topgolf clubs that are offered to you (for men and women), the grass patch with tees and the machine that spits out the balls. A host walked us to the golf cabana and explained the process. They really push the ""No Happy Gilmoring."" You are then handed off to a server who can get your food and drink orders. I had a frozen Ketle One moscow mule and it was perfection. #STRONG

There are multiple games you can play within the targets on the range. You start by waving your club in front of the ball machine sensor and poof-- your ball. You get 20 balls per person per game. However, you can complete multiple games in an hour. We played for 2 hours and it felt too long. haha But, that might just be me. The screen will tell you how far and fast you hit the ball ONLY if you make it in a target. There are 4 big targets and another 4 small ones. 

I can see the appeal of this place and I enjoyed watching friends who love golf getting excited. However, personally if this was near my house-- it wouldn't be my go-to place. It is expensive and while fun, I think there are better places to have fun for the price. With that being said, it is definitely worth at least one trip.

The food is pretty good but the service is without a doubt some of the worst I have experienced. I have tried on several occasions to use Kneaders for business lunches as my office is close by. I place the order ahead of time and each time I have arrived they seem surprised by my request and have to find my order to start preparing it. This last time today it affected an important meeting for me. I waited for a half hour while they made 4 sandwiches and I watched the guy packing it up stop 4 times to text on his phone. He then took it somewhere and set it down. They had no idea anyone was waiting so I had to ask 2 different people to please get me my order. I have given this place several chances to redeem themselves but this is obviously a chronic problem. Not going back.,0.0
"Here is the first of two one star reviews for local mechanics in the Henderson area. I stopped in here one afternoon to get a quote on doing my 120K mile service on my truck.

Then I ordered the Benihana Delight (chicken and shrimp) for my gf and the server asked how I would like it cooked...lol what?
   Our chef came out and started preparing our food with so many slip ups and mistakes that it was hard to ignore. I've had a hibachi chef before who was barely 18 and he made less mistakes. As I looked around the room I noticed the other chefs were much more skilled so clearly we just got the short end of the stick. 
   The food was definitely the saving grace, everything was delicious, from the chicken fried rice to the scallops. However, my filet mignon was a little undercooked and bland.

I am not a big fan of barbeque but my husband wanted to go so we did. When we walked in the hostess said there would be about a 20 minute wait although there were plenty of empty tables.  When we asked we were told that they did not think they would be so busy and therefore did not have enough staff.  The food was less than OK and I thought it was expensive.

"Hash House A Go Go was a convenient spot for my family and I to have lunch at due to the fact that it is located right in the entrance of the Plaza Hotel and Casino. We hopped off our long flight and decided to grab a quick bite to eat after checking in at the hotel. My brother had been to this establishment before and actually recommended it to me, so I was actually really excited to have lunch here.

The restaurant definitely gets a star for their friendly staff. Our waitress there patiently took our orders and brought us everything we asked for in a timely manner. She had a cheery attitude and overall, made me feel much less stressed after my long travels. Later that night, I also came back to drop in to the bar to order that Watermelon Cocktail that the hotel had advertised on every wall. The bartender was also friendly and helped me out with my drinks quickly.
They do some pretty cool drinks and that warrants another star. During that lunch break I ordered a banana latte, which was fantastic. The warmth and general sweetness gave me a sense of nostalgia and made me feel like I was home. The Watermelon Cocktail that I got later on was also very good. Not too sweet and not too sour. Overall I was very happy with those.

Unfortunately, I was not that impressed with my meal. I ordered a mushroom burger and fries. I love mushrooms--usually I'll eat anything that it's smothered in--however, my burger tasted like it was lacking some flavor. I can't put my finger on what it was missing, but it just seemed sort of soggy and bland. The fries were great though and that really lightening the whole plate.
The atmosphere was as you could expect from a hotel lobby restaurant. The entire place was flooded with that strange smell that floats throughout the Plaza Hotel, almost like old cologne mixed in with the trademark Las Vegas cigarette smoke.

As for seafood, there was pretty much just cocktail shrimp and king crab legs.

It took the maintenance staff three different attempts (3 days) to fix our hot water heater. From what I've seen all they do is clean the system\/replace a filter before they even look at the unit and then we have to call again. 
The previous rental company brought in decent people that have lived here for years, and did a decent amount of profiling. This company brings in questionable tenants to fill up the apts and are gone within 2 months. There are children's toys strewn about the property when I take my dog for a walk and I have to avoid pet feces when I walk through the grass. None of these things were problems when we first moved here.
They are obsessed with notices. It took them over five months to remodel the pool and it was hot before they finished. I assume someone went in because there was a notice saying trespassing would be punished by law. Notices were just sent out about past due payments that would lead to eviction to half the complex. It turns out that their payment system malfunctioned, and they immediately turn on their tenants? Who are these people? If I could give no stars, I would. The cheap rent is not worth it.

"Let me start by warning all customers about the employees prior to visiting this location. I came to this location one night for dinner with my family. Yes I had a big order but EVERYTHING on my order was wrong. When I came back to get everything fixed the Manager ALEX was very rude and extremely unprofessional!

Even though I had all the food brought back, and the receipt to show they messed up on my order QUEN the employee there argued and blamed the other employee who was training for why my food was wrong.

We had purchased a groupon for this place and wanted to try it out. So last Saturday we went to the location on Rainbow. Before hand we looked online and on yelp to see what time they were open til. On Saturday night at 7 we arrived to the place only to find the place completely closed.  Mind you everywhere we looked and even on the door said that they were open til 9 pm. No sign no nothing explaining why they closed early. It wouldn't of been such a big deal if we lived by the area. But we live on the other side of town. So my husband called around and someone at the Warm Springs location answered and said that they would accept our groupon at their location. It's was more or less 5 mins away. When we got there the place looked closed. The lack of light led me to believe that.  However the open sign let me know that they were in fact open. There were no customers when we got there. There was one guy working there. He was really cool and talkative. He explained the menu to us and was helpful. I ordered the Buddha bowl and my husband the passion bowl. My bowls base was greens and my husband's traditional. Rice. The fish was good. The sauces were good too.  It wasn't bad tasting. But to us the portion sizes were just extremely disappointing. I found myself still so hungry afterwards. I figured since I ordered greens as my base I'd get more that just a handful of greens or if you can even call it that.  Honestly i have had better poke bowls else where. I really wanted to like this place. This location inside is beautiful. I love the decor.

Our search for a decent pasta in Scarborough brought us to Scaddabush on a hot Saturday evening.  As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by at least 3 staff that were crammed in the narrow doorway.  

The restaurant itself had a very confused (eclectic, if you want to be nice) decor which translated into many other aspects which I'll get into later on.  We were seated in a bar section in a booth that was just a little too tight to comfortably get in and out of and the rail at the bottom of the banquet seating definitely would have posed a hazard to someone wearing high heels and not paying attention.  You could see the remnants of Jack Astor days very evidently here with rows of TVs facing our table. 

Since we had already read the reviews\/menu, we ordered our appetizers first and browsed the menu for the mains.  As we waited, it was already uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.  When asked, the server replied that the A\/C was on full and that she felt the heat more as she was moving around.  A curious response, indeed.  

Our server promptly returned with our bottle of wine and 2 visibly dirty wine glasses that I had to point out for her to bring new ones.  Our appetizer arrived and I was shocked to see the size of their signature meatball (just about 5 cm in diameter).  Sure, it was larger than most meatballs you encounter but at $13 a pop, I thought there would be more to it.  The meatball itself was flavourful but on a salty side and I'm pretty sure I won't order it again at $13 per meatball.  The bomba burrata was a much better dish with the creamy burrata swimming in a generously chillied tomato sauce.  The accompanying bread wedges were too oily for my liking and it was annoying to have to wipe my hands every time I reached for my glass of wine in between sampling the burrata.  

We had decided on the fettucine capri and a sirloin for our mains and funny enough, a doe-eyed waitress came by with a peppermill and some cheese before the mains even came out and asked us if we wanted some.  Uh...no...there is no food on our table, don't you see that???  

Fettunice capri came was generous in portion and I was happy to see that they were using fresh pasta.  The accompanying tomato sauce was also good and kudos to the kitchen for not over-cooking the seafood.  The gremolata that came atop the past was a little too coarsely chopped but it was fine.  But the real sour point was the lack of attention paid to the pasta noodles itself as there were too many parts of the pasta that were stuck together in a chewy clump.  My husband's sirloin was flavourless and cold as if it had sat in the kitchen while my pasta was being made.  Cold steak is not a yummy steak.  

Food aside, Scaddabush really needs to decide what kind of establishment they want to be as there was music blaring way too loudly the whole time we were dining.  It was hard to have a conversation without leaning across the table.  As we were leaving the restaurant, I saw a DJ standing next to the front of the house as people were seated uncomfortably in a row of chairs waiting for a table.  

Overall, Scaddabush experience was just that; ""a little bit of everything.""  Food wasn't bad albeit some execution issues.  The service and the ambiance is where they really felt short and if I wanted to drop $140 for a pasta dinner, it'll be elsewhere for sure.",0.0

"Will never rent from here again. I waited in the customer service line for almost an hour and when I was finally called to the counter, the agent called not only me but the party behind me. She proceeded to help the party behind me with the reservation that they did not have even though I was in line before them. 

After finally getting my paperwork I proceeded downstairs to retrieve the keys for my vehicle and again, waited in line while one agent was helping everyone while they other was doing something on his phone....

After getting the keys to the vehicle, apparently the agent was supposed to tell me that I needed to return after inspecting the vehicle to get more paperwork and a barcode to exit the lot. He did not tell me anything. I found all this out after I had already driven to the exit. He tried to argue with me that he did tell me but I was not the only one to return in frustration about the exit.

"I had two unnecessary fillings via Aspen Dental. I have maybe 2-3 cavities my entire life and I am 30! 

My last cleaning was in January at a different location where I had no cavities 

October 6 was the initial visit at Aspen dental where I went in for a chipped tooth. They then told me I had 2 cavities that were small surface\/ preventative ones. 
They also tried to upsell me on fluoride rinse, as well as tell me I had gingivitis, which I can say with full certainty is not the case. 

On Oct 24th I had the fillings done. 
I recall during the process that after numbing to where I couldn't feel my nose, I felt the pain of their drilling. They gave me a second numbing shot. For such a minimal cavity I do not feel it should have gone this deep to require a second numbing shot. 

After leaving, and the numbing wore off, I Experienced excessive pain when closing my mouth, eating or drinking. 
This pain did not seem to get any better with time. 

On Nov 11 tried new location as I had such severe pain when trying to sleep, eat, drink or even close my mouth. I am not a type of person to ever get headaches and it was a daily occurrence to wake up with headaches. 

I had Spoke with dentist who was unsure of why they had done fillings as he did not see anything while examining the X-rays. 

Nov 16 went for another visit to have the fillings ground down as he thought they were possibly too high which was causing discomfort. 

After this, I was still experienced excessive pain. This Dentist was very concerned that because the fillings were so deep (do note above these were ""preventative fillings"") I was at risk for needing a root canal since I had so much nerve damage. 

On Nov 19 I had fillings removed and temps put in to try and calm down my nerves. 

Finally after months of having the temp fillings, the pain subsided and I was able to go in for the permanent fillings in March. 

The management at aspen dental made it rather clear how unconcerned they were with my situation. Despite that they refunded my initial costs, the pain I endured unnecessarily wasn't even worth an apology.",0.0

"I've been waiting for 4 months to go to Fuddruckers. It was one of our favorite places to go for burgers in San Diego California. However it's far from where I live. So today March 25th 2016, I came out to summerlin to eat here finally. Boy was I disappointed! The place was very dirty & the food wasn't good at all.  Our buns on our burgers were stale & the frings we ordered tasted like dirty oil & precooked then redipped when we ordered them. There was absolutely no seasoning on the burgers or fries. Our food was cold & they had barely any produce to put on the burgers. It was 6pm on a Friday night & the restraunt was very empty however alot of the tables were dirty with dishes on them & not wiped down. I had to ask the girl at the register if they could wipe down our table! Her response was we do when people leave were are you sitting & what tables are dirty? My response was almost all of the tables. The cheese sauces were dripping all over the sides of the containers, the coke machine was dirty & very sticky. The floors are horrible with sauces on them. Bathrooms are just as bad. After eating my burger only, without the bread, I told a worker that came to the table about my experience with the bread & she talked to the manager then told us he doesn't know why they gave us stale buns, when they have fresh ones that they made today. My whole thought process of this Fuddruckers is horrible. It ruined my whole night out especially driving 30+ miles to get here. I will never go here again.",0.0

"I liked Kays because my husband bought promise rings there, so he bought my engagement ring there. That's when it went downhill. I guess it's great for ""cheaper"" products, but not worth you spending extravagant money. It took 6 months for my engagement ring to be resized, when it was promised 3 months. I got my ring in a week before my wedding, but that's only after I talked to Cheryl who told me that's all she could do. The employee told me it would take a week, but she rushed it 2 days. I called up the district manager and he was able to compensate a little, but it honestly should have been more. A month after I bought my wedding band, a stone fell out. At this point, I am just returning it. I'm tired of doing business here. I had the opportunity to return the engagement ring, but there's importance behind  it so I'm not going to return it. Definitely don't recommend going here. Haha.",0.0
"I am a huge fan of New Mexico style food, Carne Adovada being one of my favorite. I kept reading ""best authentic new mexican"" in the reviews. I couldn't disagree more. The food has an extremely heavy gringo influence for the worst. Could not serve this anywhere in New Mexico. I have never had Carne Adovada with pork that was dry and tough. As a cook, my guess is the pork was made days ahead of time and reheated (poorly). Then to make things worse, the adovada sauce had a distinct charred \/ burned taste to it. Cheese crisp had no crisp and was soggy instead. This is authentic to where I don't know other than here.

Not sure where all the great reviews are coming from. The only thing I can guess based on the crowd was that they have a lot of very loyal customers that are of the retirement age (or older)  and have been going there for years. Certainly nothing wrong with that. 

They had a full dining room with only 3 servers and one bus person and service was slow at best. I don't blame the servers as it was apparent that they were completely overwhelmed and doing the best they were allowed to do. Servers were even making the drinks\/cocktails\/margaritas for their tables. Wanted so much to like this place, but it was simply not a good experience. The owner \/ manager even came by and took our menus before we even ordered and without ever asking if we were done with them. In fact she never said a word to us. No one ever came by to ask how the meal was or to refill drinks.

They did take the uneaten Carne Adovada off the bill, thank goodness. Definitely won't ever be back.",0.0
"Usually I have better service but tonight was awful. I ordered curbside to go ordered two sirloin steaks with French fries, mashed potatoes, broccoli and a baked potato. My fries were beyond Soggy and there was literally like 12 fries in the box. I asked if I could get more fries the man says you would have to pay $3 for more, because they're weighed out. First off if I was inside  dining in I bet they would've got me different and more fries. Money was not the problem I pay the $3 for more fries and he comes out with a box that's not even half full. I ask for A1 sauce and he brings me A1 sauce in the carrier and it's not even filled up, mind you I have two steaks! The mashed potatoes were dry and the courtesy bread that's given was hard also.

It doesn't deserve 1 star. Wait staff have no customer service skills at all!! Worst place ever!!!,0.0
Very unimpressed. They have one teller only at the first of the month. Waited in line for over 35 minutes. When multiple people asked why there were no tellers the greeter told us everyone was on their lunch. I don't understand why they need a greeter when they could have had 2 tellers. Someone had over 10 cash deposits and they still kept her as the only teller. One person in the back of the line made a scene and said she was going to leave her money and leave the bank. She actually got pulled to the front of the line and was helped. She might have been there 15 minutes total. I guess the moral of the story is make a huge scene so they take care of you? What makes it worse is their greeter\/customer service persons attitude. She deflected every single complaint instead of being apologetic about the wait she was going into how many required hours they have and talking about labor laws. Zero customer service. New management necessary,0.0

They said I'd have to change rooms by 6PM - which was impossible (I'm working a conference).  Tried to escalate to supervisor, they put me on hold for 11 minutes before I gave up.

Next, the waiter was courteous, and did a decent job.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere, as well, but we will not be returning in the future.  We got the Shrimp Alexander appetizer, which we both loved, but that was the only thing we really liked.   As far as dinner goes, my shrimp capellini was just ok.  My husband got the veal chop and did not like it.  He ordered it well-done but it was rare a few bites in.  He ended up leaving a lot of the expensive dinner on the plate.  Further, the waiter referred to the veal chop as a pork chop two times, which made my husband feel uneasy throughout the night, and put a psychological damper on his meal because he cannot eat pork.  An innocent slip on the waiter's part, I'm sure, but it was just the icing on the proverbial cake of a lackluster, but super pricey dinner.   We also asked for lemons for his salad, but the lemons were a bit dehydrated.  The sour cream mashed potatoes were okay by me, but my husband didn't like them at all.

"I'm very conflicted on this place - my wife and I have been there for breakfast a few times while in Vegas. 

The food itself is decent.  My wife usually goes for the eggs benedict and she enjoys it - she gives them a 4\/5 (and she eats them just about everywhere).  I've had a number of different breakfast dishes and find them to be good, but not any better than anywhere else.  

I find the service to be very inconsistent however.  Like others have written when they are busy service can be really slow (I know it's difficult when it is busy - but this is Vegas and you know weekends will be extremely busy - you should plan around that).  So if it looks busy and you're in a rush you might want to avoid this place. 

The weird part is that even when they're not busy service is hit and miss.  Most recently they couldn't get our order straight.  My wife was offered fruit or hash browns with her meal - she ended up being given both (although it looked like a half order of each).  I asked for bacon with mine and ended up with ham.

Everything about this place is EXTREMELY unsanitary and needs to be shut down, that is how bad it is. The pizza dough falls on the ground(which is caked in mud) almost once a week and instead of throwing away the dough they continue to use it. Nobody washes their hands their...not even the owner especially after touching raw meats. When they wash dishes they do not use any Clorox to sanitize the dishes (which they are suppose to do).

If you want a good experience at Jamie's Italian, this would be my advice:

5. Forget the Fresh Crab Bruschetta
6. If you don't like ""spicy"" foods read the description closely....a lot of dishes have ""chillis"".

Our experience........

1. Hostess was nice but only seating available was at the bar or a ""yeah there's a table for two left that no one esle wants to sit at"".
2. The chairs at the bar are great if you're solo but hard to manoeuvre if you're with someone.
3. The Arancini are just ok. They spilt a couple of them in half which turns them cold in about 10 seconds. The Fresh Crab bruschetta is underwhelming but spicy
4. It took a waiter 15 minutes to approach us after we sat down

"My finest memories growing up are running outside to bring my dad the kosher salt, or the tongs while he rotated the grill loaded with chicken. From time to time, he'd even let me rotate the grill: ""Devagar,"" (slowly) he'd warn me, ""the galinha (chicken) won't be good if you go too fast... good food takes time."" So maybe it's these memories of growing up in an extremely Portuguese household that makes me a bit biased on what excellent Portuguese chicken should be like. I've lived in King City for almost two years, and have passed by The Chicken Place a number of times. The sight of a churrasqueira an hour drive away from my hometown where my family lives, but only 5 minutes near my current residence made me hopeful: would it be like Dad's? I was hopeful: so we ordered the works. 1  1\/2 whole chickens, potatoes, rice, French fries, coleslaw and two containers of piri piri. Chourico, and two containers of shrimp. When we were told it was going to 30 - 45 minutes, I was completely fine with this, remembering what my dad said to me as a kid: good food takes time. 

Maybe it was my high expectations, or my naïve belief that anything could be like my dad's, but this wasn't it. The chicken was curiously flavourless, missing that familiar faint taste of salt, those flavours that reminded me of my dad, and the Portuguese festas, and the family gatherings in parks. It was just...chicken. Overcooked chicken, that no matter how much piri piri I put on it, just didn't cut it. The shrimp was curiously oily, the potatoes bland, the French fries being the one thing I actually enjoyed. 

Don't get me wrong, The Chicken Place isn't bad: but for almost $100 - I expected more: if not Dad's chicken, at least something that was reminiscent of the number of churrasqueira's I've frequented: something that would make me want more.",0.0

This restaurant is operated by Koreans.  The tables have a button that plays a sound for the waiter\/waitress to come to your table.  

We ordered the Love Boat and Spider roll:

Love Boat ($60): 29 sushi & maki, 20 sashimi, 2 miso soups & 2 green salads.  It came with salmon, salmon belly, tuna, butterfish, tilapia, eel, shrimp, California roll, spicy salmon roll, dragon roll (half green, half red).  For $60, I thought it was extremely pricy and disappointed considering the fact that they did not give squid, scallop, uni, yellow tail or toro.  Soup and salad was pretty average.  

Spider Roll $14: deep fried real soft shell crab, crab stick, tobiko, lettuce, bonito & cucumber.  Quantity greater than quality for this one.  After eating one piece, I didn't feel like eating a second one.  

Even with their happy hour special, I don't think their Love Boat is worth order considering the price and the cuts of fish that come with it.

"We went to Carrabas for our 39th wedding anniversary.  We have gone to this restaurant for years.  My daughter made a reservation online and one of the questions was, is this a special occasion.  She put in that it was our anniversary.

We got there and our server was so unfriendly that it made our dinner uncomfortable.  Her name was Nicole and she was so bothered by us that I just wanted to leave.  When dinner was over she asked if we wanted dessert.  I kind of thought that we might get a cupcake with a candle since it was our anniversary and we had chosen Carrabas as our special place, but no.

On 3\/24 I ordered a to go soup and rice. When I got home, I realized the soup was just water with some chili on it. Not cooked together at all and missing its normal ingredients.  I called and first employee kept putting me on hold - then spoke with another waitress (named Penny). She what she could do for me, I asked for a refund - she said only the owner could do that, she was just a waitress. I asked to contact the owner or a manager - she said there was no one, they were out of town. I replied asking again for a manager and politely asked her if she knew Southern Nevada Health District requires a manager or PERSON IN CHARGE to always be on property - to which she said ""I know, but he is out of town"". Then she hung up the phone and didn't answer my return calls.

Being upset by how I was treated, I looked up their inspections on the Southern Nevada Health District website and see they have several B ratings with 20 demerits\/violations. Watching how the employee was cleaning the floor and touching the mop with her hands - AND no person in charge as required by law - I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE ANYMORE.",0.0

This place must be under different ownership\/management & that's unfortunate. It took over 45 min to get my car, the back half was water-spotted from sitting in the sun due to the backup of cars. The employees were scrambling & obviously under-staffed (not their fault). Finally got to my car & the trunk had not been vacuumed, at all. So I had to drive it around & wait. Again.

She stops in the middle of doing my nails to take another client, stating ""I'll be right back I have an appointment at 4"". Why did I have to wait 30 mins I had an appointment as well! And to top it all off...all of the technicians (including the owners) were arguing in there language very loudly in front of all of the customers, and this isn't the first time they've done this.

The rest of the stuff is edible, but the naan is just plain atrocious. I have had Afghani food in other locations and it's flavourful and delicious. This does not hold up.

"3 Stars, the place was busy on a saturday afternoon, but I don't see it much better if it was tuesday at opening either.
The food is simple, the presentation is zero. It's not bad sushi and it's not great either. Yes, the server was not smiling, but I don't care if he does or not.
If you want to see a smiling clown, go to the circus. He was prompt in seating us, we waited just a few minutes, took our drink order and then on with the sushi in the All you can eat mode.
The first order of various rolls were good and as I said before it's just little round plastic like plates and no presentation points, not too overly sauced and was ok. We didn't get the small soy sauce dishes, but just put the sauce in the larger plate that had the wasabi and ginger on it. The sign on the wall said ""Fresh Wasabi"" $1, but the wasabi that came with the sushi was fresh as can be and had the punch to the nose zip! We started out with one server and then another one started to serve us, which was kind of odd, but it worked. The two guys are busy and if they hired just a single table busser they could take care of business much better. It's not a good thing when suddenly a plate drops down like a stone from heaven and you don't know what the item is, they are too busy to tell you. We actually had one roll fall on our table that we didn't know it was for someone else until we ate it. I'm like, ""We didn't order this"", but it was good so thanks to whoever didn't get it. LOL! I also order a few nigiri sushi (the small bites) and it took a while for it to arrive, I could see it was ready up at the sushi bar, but it sat for a few minutes. Then when it came the rice was noticeably warm which meant they didn't make enough during prep time because it should be cool to compliment the fish. 
The restaurant is tiny inside, but somehow they manage to seat everyone the best they can. Random signs on the walls with specials such as $1 sake and different beers. I had a Sapporo light and it was good, I guess they don't offer the giant godzilla size bottle like most places, but that is ok by me. I am in Summerlin and have a long drive back to Henderson so, no buzz is a good thing. My second drink was Asahi Zero which is a low carb and no alcohol ""beer"", it was cold and good with enough bubbles to satisfy like a coke, but with no sugar overload. The also offer a Mango soda in a bottle and it was good too.
The restaurant is located in or near Summerlin, but I will have to admit there was some skectchy looking people in that parking lot, but that is no fault of the restaurant. Probably just a product of their environment with a thrift store on one side and big lots on the other? Just saying.

"I had a comprehensive exam, fmx and prophy done. I expressed my concerns with my dental health and with dental care I have received. Dr. Hargrave did not acknowledge my concerns. I had a crown replaced in October to utilize my remaining dental benefit. Now, 1 yr later I have been to another dentist who did perio probing and gave me numbers that were significantly different than the numbers taken by Dr. Hargrave and his hygienist. I do not believe they are very competent at what they do. (when I say significant I mean he gave me numbers maintainable like 2's, 3's maybe a 4 or 5 but now I have 12 and 9... don't think that happened in 1yr)  I had to return and have the crown recemented in after it just fell out 1week after seating... they do not clean  nor etch the prep\/build-up area after taking the temp out and before final cementation....so...for 3wks this area has been collecting muck and they just have an assistant slap the final in.... They also bill for build-up automatically even thought there wasn't any build-up done. I couldn't, and still can't, chew on that restoration, but won't return. Dr. Hargrave's solution to adjusting my bite was to grind down the opposite crown (also a restoration...jeopardizing the integrity of that restoration) instead of addressing his own work. 
In retrospect I am additionally peeved that they had gone ahead with placing a crown and billing me and my insurance on a tooth that has compromised bone health.

"----------------------------UPDATE---------------------------------
Original issue, after multiple trips to repair my AC that would blow hot, my oil pressure gauge would now start fluctuating, moving from High to Low, sometimes dipping very Low.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
After my first review was posted, and then a response from Midway's Aaron H., Eventually someone did reach out to me through Yelp.  They had me speak to Leslie, who is the Customer Service Manager now.

The first thing she did was make sure I got an appointment to get the car looked at.  She even spoke with the garage foreman Aaron to make sure that their best mechanic was the one to look at my vehicle.  She then went back through my service visits for the original repair and gave me a breakdown of exactly what was done each time and costs associated on my end and the dealership end of things.  This was greatly appreciated as I did not get all of the paperwork originally. 

The next day I dropped off my car and Leslie walked me through the possible things they would find or not find.  She even went beyond the visit and suggested many different things that I could do with my vehicle if i wanted to keep or sell it at this point as the vehicle is about 10 years old.  She even said she would have her sales guys look for a newer Xterra for me as well.

After about an hour or so the Foreman Aaron had finished his evaluation and said that the fluctuation in the oil pressure was normal and that everything was okay.  This was highly curious to me as when it would spike low the engine would shake the car.  I made a video on my cell phone for just this occasion and showed both him and Leslie the gauge dropping to extreme low.  Aaron then changed his diagnosis and said that he would like to keep the car over night and look at it from a ""Cold Start"". Luckily I had the next day off so it would not be a major inconvenience for me if I left the car overnight.  Leslie arranged to get me a ride back to my house from the shuttle.  After about 45 mins the shuttle did show up and dropped me off.

The next morning Leslie called me and said that the initial tests and findings could not see anything wrong on the outside of the engine so the issue may be on the inside of the engine.  As Leslie told me the  previous day to even open the engine to look at it would be about 600 and if they needed to repair the item they think is the issue would be about 2000. Pretty steep bill for a ""guess"" that may or may not fix the issue.  I declined to go that route as the car itself is barely over that for blue book value right now.  So I had them get me a shuttle back and after about an hour or so my ride came and took me back to Midway.  Before I left I asked Leslie if Aaron had hooked up a wet gauge to by pass the electrical components and test the oil pressure directly.  She did not know the exact things he did so she walked me back to the garage to  ask Aaron directly.  He said that he did do that as one of his checks and said he thinks it was an internal issue still. I thanked him and Leslie for all of their effort and time and took the car home, with the issue I originally had.

Later during the week my friend after hearing how much they wanted to look at the engine helped me hook up a wet gauge to oil pressure to get a direct reading. The Oil pressure was stable and did not fluctuate at all. We drove around for about 45 to 60 minutes and the pressure did not fluctuate at all.  Hooked up the car back to the electronic oil ""sender"" unit and the pressure fluctuated again as before. Im not a car expert at all but this seemed very strange to me as if it was an internal engine issue the wet gauge should produce the same fluctuations.

The only positive side was working with Leslie, to her credit she shouldered blame for the old service advisers not explaining everything done and not providing paperwork. She genuinely does care about her customers.  She goes above and beyond to make sure that every possibility is explored and is diligent about making sure that you understand everything that is going on with your vehicle treating it with the time and effort as if it were her own.  Anyone reading this should always go to her directly for issues.  She did try to see if the original issue could be resolved.

But the end result of all of the back and forth is that I still have a vehicle that started having oil pressure issues after Midway repaired my warm AC issues and in order to try to get it fixed it will cost me 2600. And this may not even fix it. Disappointing to say the least.

Side note, my AC started blowing warm again! All I can do is laugh.

I tried to contact Midway about this for the past year and the only time I got a response was from a Yelp review. A star back for Leslie but my original assessment still stands ""the repairs end up costing you more than you initially paid in time and money""

"Terrible service, they are completely unconcerned about keeping appointments and getting people serviced in a timely manner.  I went in to get ONE nail fixed, waited for 40 mins, then the lady asked who did it before, to which I responded that I was out of town when I got them done and I just wanted one repainted because it broke.  She responded that she'd have to call her boss.  For what? I was going to PAY YOU to paint ONE NAIL.  You don't offer to fix nails unless they are done by you?  I can certainly see how you wouldn't do it for free but I wasn't assuming it'd be free.  She then proceeded to take someone else back who I was there before.  That's what I walked out and told her don't bother calling her boss because I've been waiting long enough and this place is ridiculous.  If they ran their business better they would have a real opportunity considering the premium location, parking, etc.  They really need to move to appointment only at this point, but they have no way of even knowing if you made one.  I've made an appointment multiple times and they don't even ask me for my name to confirm and I still end up waiting behind walk ins.  I used to go here all the time but never again.",0.0
"Well, it's honestly too bad you can't leave negative stars. Besides the fact that the cupcakes are dry and have more frosting than cake, this place ruined our son's birthday party.

We went in a week ahead of time to order cupcakes for our son's birthday party. We ordered the fun flavors that they had, and that he and his friends would enjoy. Well, when I stopped in today to pick up the cupcakes on the way to the party, not only weren't they ready, but the order had been put aside. Apparently, the manager had written ""CALL"" on the order (which never happened), and what's worse, he had taken off to attend an event and wasn't available. 

Now the bad stuff... I was then told that none of the flavors we chose were available. And, the only flavors and cupcakes they had were for Valentine's Day. At this point, since I had already paid a week in advance for this order, I took a dozen Valentine's Day cupcakes with pink and red confetti to my son's birthday party. On top of it, the woman working there handed me a $5 gift card and said ""this should make up for it"". Well, guess what GiGi's...it doesn't even come close to making up for your horrid customer service. 

Not only do I NOT recommend this place; I recommend any other cupcake company. Not to mention, we will never be using this $5 sad attempt gift card.

"Are you hungry enough for a knuckle sandwich? Well, come and get it!
The restaurant name is literal: there are only seven sandwiches on their menu. On the bright side, the portion sizes are huge and the prices are low, so they definitely picked the right location across the street from UNLV. I can see this being a huge hit with students with limited income. 

The knuckle sandwich contains grilled salami, pepperoni, and ham with melted mozarella, topped with what appears to be a small salad of lettuce, tomato, and champagne vinaigrette. I actually really enjoyed the salad part, which was fresh and helped offset the overall heaviness of the sandwich and also the overwhelming saltiness. Perhaps leaving the salami fresh may help with that? Sandwiches come with a choice of side- the ""stack o chips"" are coin-cut fries with a seasoning that was also fairly salty.  Might be a good idea to move the soda fountain to the dining room instead of behind the counter.

Service was quick and fast and the location has plenty of seating. Note that they close at 5PM daily, so unless you're a senior (citizen), it's likely a lunch-only option. The Italian Chick-en Vegas seems to be their most popular option, will try it when in the area again.",0.0
"I'd previously dined at Bardot Brasserie back in March on my last trip to Las Vegas and was unimpressed.  Not one to be deterred, the wife and I went there to see if happy hour on a Monday evening was a better experience.  While we didn't take advantage of the happy hour drink specials (I had a regular priced cocktail, a Vieux Carré instead), we did partake in the food off of the HH menu.  We shared orders of the Prime Steak Tartare and the Braised Short Rib Tartine.  I'll admit without any shame that I'm a cocktail snob.  My drink possessed all of the expected notes of the classic Vieux Carré, however, it didn't seem properly chilled.  Since it didn't taste over-diluted, I can only guess that either my drink wasn't sufficiently stirred or it was served in warm rocks glass.   Either way, it wasn't as cold and as good as it should've been.

Our food was, similarly, hit or miss.  The steak tartare was served on thin, waffle-cut, potato chips.  It was tender, meaty, and flavorful.  It was a hit with us.  The Braised Short Rib Tartine was an unfortunate miss.  The braised short rib on the tartine was rich in flavor, moist and tender.  It was made even richer with the fried egg that also came atop the tartine.  The downfall of the dish was the bread itself, which was overbaked, required sawing through it with a knife to cut it into halves for sharing, tough, and very chewy.  Don't get me wrong, it tasted fine and it wasn't worth the time and hassle of sending it back.  Still, for whatever reasons, in my experience, Bardot Brasserie continues to be the outlier in an otherwise excellent group of Michael Mina restaurants in Las Vegas.",0.0
"Came here on a Monday night for Winterlicious. My gf booked that day and got the last reservation for 7pm. Every seat in the house had a butt in it when we got there.

I got the mixed green salad, prime rib and tiramisu. My girlfriend got the crab cakes, prime rib and apple crumble. Timing for bread and salads were great. I've gotten the mixed green salad here before and became a fan of it. The dressing they use is really tasty, so I was excited for this. Totally finished the salad. My gfs crab cakes were just ok. You get two kinda small cakes. After the starters is where it went downhill. We waited 30 minutes + for our entrees! Even the table next to us got their food first and they were a group of four that came AFTER us! I had to ask our waitress what was taking so long and she said the kitchen got really busy. Uhhh??? Really, not a good excuse. Anyways when the food DID finally come out, it was actually really good. My gf and I both got our prime ribs done medium rare. Both were juicy and tender. I just wished they had regular mashed potatoes because their wasabi infused mash is disgusting. That's why I had to opt for a bake potato this time. Which was alright I guess. Came with all the fixings.

Dessert followed within a reasonable time. Would never get the tiramisu again. It's basically a cup of cream with bits of cake here and there. There really weren't any layers to it. Apple crumble was only good because of the ice cream.

"So on Tuesday (12\/6\/16) afternoon, I called this Target and spoke to TWO DIFFERENT people in guest services and both of the ladies I spoke to, told me that they were able to price match other items at a different store that are in store and not online. So with that being said, I went here to do that and price match an item and the manager had came over to do the price match and then told me that she couldn't price match the item for me because she had to be able to find it online which it was an in store item so therefore it was not online. I had it on the Walmart app for in-store showing that it was Walmart and that price in store... she refused to price match it for us because we did not have an ad showing that it was that price in store which everything isn't always in the ad just because it's on sale or ringing up as a certain price at a store... I was upset because neither of the two ladies I spoke with in guest services told me this on the phone and saved me the inconvenience, and because the manager was unhelpful and so rude to me about it. I could tell she was doing whatever she could to not price match the item for me. I forget what her name was but I believe it started with a ""T"", she was an older Caucasian woman working there that afternoon. She was not friendly at all, nor caring.

"3hours later, we were finally able to complete our dinner. As explained by the owner at the end of our meal, it was their first week opening and had some technical issues, but the wait time was ridiculously long. We were told at the beginning that there is a circulating 7 tapa dishes served every 10mins and that we can eat as many rounds as possible, however, ""no one has ever went to round 2."" And now I can see why! The wait time ranged from 15-35mins per item, and each dish took about 2 mins to eat. Thus, lasting us 3 hours before the first round was even served.

I wish I could say that the food was worth the wait, but it really wasn't.

But be prepared to pay a $3 ATM charge, meaning I essentially paid an extra $7 just for being in the only gay establishment in town (of course, one way around paying that fee would be to sneak your own booze in, but that's not something I recommend because then they would lose revenue from drink sales and you might find yourself in trouble). The drinks were not very strong, unfortunately. They had a second story dance floor, but that was closed off to my disappointment. A lot of straight people were there; I'd say nearly 50%. They had a back patio, which actually was really lovely albeit walled in 10+ feet high. On an important planning\/land use note, the club was not in a very attractive neighborhood; vacant lots and unoccupied building fronts. Aren't gay people supposed to improve their surrounding real estate? That's a rhetorical question. Between all of these observations, I do expect more from those who are leaders in the LGBT+ community within the UIUC region to develop a stronger, more dignified sense of character. That starts with management, obviously, but it also requires existing coalitions focused on improving queer livelihood within campus and municipal spheres to be involved in the neighborhood. The reason I don't give this place less than 3 stars is because I respect my people too much and I truly hope they look at this review and take my grievances seriously. It isn't rocket science on what improvements could be made to make Chester Street a 5 star place in the future.",0.0
"Worst experience with a law firm period.  April Newton would not respond in a timely fashion (days \/ weeks) they were not able to dismiss my case and did not even request all of the details pertaining to the case (ie. no laser \/ radar gun used).

"Presidio Cocina Mexicana is a little Mexican food joint across the street from St. Joseph's Hospital. I'd classify their food as somewhere between upscale Mexican and your more traditional mainstream Mexican chains that flood the city.

We've dined here a handful of times and I can confidently say that their tacos are very good. I've tried the asada, pastor, chorizo, and cochinita pibil. Served on corn tortillas, all have very good flavor and quality. Their guacamole, unfortunately, is hit and miss. The first time we tried it, my girlfriend and I were impressed. The second time, it was so overkill on the lime that the whole thing tasted like some kind of ultra-sour paste. For ten dollars, you damn-well better have some consistency. 

Rice and beans are kind of what you'd expect and are fairly standard. During one visit, I took a risk and upgraded to their street corn and was quite pleased with the results.

My girlfriend typically orders their enchiladas plate with rice and beans. Be warned that their red sauce is much spicier than their green, which is typically a reversal of what we're used to. Despite being Mexican, she is convinced that any type of spice is the equivalent of adding cyanide to the food. I don't quite agree with her beliefs, but the server was nice enough to accommodate her request once she realized that she made a tragic error with her ordering.

What about desserts, you ask? When we originally came here, they only had bunuelos, which always seems more like a snack than a dessert. For our second visit, we tried their alfajor, which is more of a Spanish-type cookie (or cookies in this case) sandwiched between some dulce de leche and walnuts. It's a hard cookie, which makes eating with a spoon as awkward as those ""high society"" types who eat their Snickers with a fork. 

Overall, I do like their food and feel it's a nice little Mexican joint that's good for an occasional visit. But my level of enthusiasm isn't quite on par with what most people are saying.

"Based on today's lunch experience, disappointed. They seem to have better breakfast options than lunch...

Service was very slow in-spite of not having many tables seated. Staff and manager are all on there phones, distracted, socializing and seemingly uninterested in their jobs. While we were waiting forever to get our orders taken the manager was sitting at a table close to us playing casino games on her phone with the sound blaring.... Regardless if she was on a break.... Not appropriate for her to be sitting in the dining room playing games on her phone...

We've been here twice and it's very clear where the staff's lack of ambition drive customer service and interest comes from. 

The manager wonders about the restaurant... ""Looking busy"" but not doing anything. I've not seen here make eye contact nor acknowledge a single guest or touch on any tables.

The one table she did spend 15 minutes at were ""friends"" again socializing comparing pictures on her phone and her patrons. 

I could tell that they were simply trying to get through their meals, but she kept on showing pictures and lingering...

We got 2 cokes and after about 20 mins someone finally came over to take our order. James had the California club which I tried a bit of and liked, James being a avid Club sandwich guy, prefers the real deal, not their version.

I thought it was pretty tasty and yum, I would order that perhaps in the future.

As for my Brisket dip sandwich.... A dry small brisket tasteless with brown water as the dip... Very disappointed... I would not try it again or waste money on this sandwich... Waste of time...

The plate arrived, I looked at it it, looks boring, like the manager, passed through my mind.... 

The dipping jux, did nothing but subtract from an already bore me to sleep meal...

"I was going to give the show a solid 4 stars for the talented singer, fantastic dancers, kick ass musicians and atmosphere of the 1940's, the name is correct. They bring Pin-up to life. There's no nudity, but a few carefully placed pasties (bummer).
Claire is gorgeous and has some nice moves.
The reason for the 1 star after the show while waiting for the Cast to come out. I see them lining up and I wanted to take a quick photo of the cast while waiting on line, before getting a professional photo with the cast. The girl with the photographer snapped very dismissively and rudely ""NO PERSONAL PHOTOS!!!!""
A simple ""oh we don't allow personal photos"" would have sufficed. But she was rude and nasty.
You would think after spending over 50 dollars for a show, the show would allow a quick photo, I have never had a show not allow people to take photos of the cast with their phone.
So the photographer lost a customer and a good review of the show because of the nasty girl who yelled at me. Try hiring or using classy, friendly people.

"Just picked up our order of 2lbs snow crab legs and 1lb shrimp Louisiana style ""mild"" and 1lb shrimp garlic butter ""mild"" to go. The waitress that helped me out was very helpful and nice. 

Got home all excited but we CANNOT eat any of it! None of it. Everything was too spicy. My wife loves spicy seafood, took one (1) bite and her face turned red right away. Again, we ordered ""mild"" so we just couldn't believe how spicy everything was. I understand the name of the restaurant is Hot n Juicy but this is just insane. 

Called them up to see what can be done since we had just paid close to $85. They said that they ""cannot control the batch of peppers they get"" and it can get really spicy. I was also advised to cook our food up again in butter. So our parents are currently recooking the meal that we paid for. Feeling very frustrated.

"Struggled between giving them 2 stars vs. 1 star.  I made a reservation over 2 weeks in advance for a 16 foot moving truck.  On the day of my move I arrived 20 mins before my appointment time. Though there was only 1 person in front of me in the line, still waited nearly 15 mins in line.  The staff seemed friendly and helpful, so that's the 1 star.  Where I'm not happy is that apparently they nearly didn't have a truck for me even though I made the reservation.  They were saying how they only had one truck left and it has no gas.  It's either that or nothing. So ok, what choice do I have right? The manager there told me when I return the truck to tell the representative at the return center to call him to approve a refund for extra gas. I mean this thing was empty!  Turning on the truck the fuel indicator was at the bottom of the E (EMPTY). So now I have to go out of my way to get gas when I was on a tight schedule...well minor inconvenience, but still a bother.  When I return the truck, the rep is like there's no gas refunds.  I told him to call the manager, which he tried twice, but couldn't reach him.  So the return rep is like we never give out refunds for gas, he's not sure what this other manager is saying.  So technically I paid an extra $15 for the truck rental.",0.0

So after I already felt stupid for my apparent mistake I was told I needed a utility bill paid within the last week and a pay stub.  I didn't see this request when I reserved it online, which was my fault. When I asked what to do in this scenario because all I pay utilities on is my srp m-power box (basically a paperless trail) he told me ""I don't know but we're closed so you should go to the enterprise down the street and ask them"". So I clearly was a problem, so was the other two customers that were complaining that they had been waiting for 45 minutes.

"Visited for the first time today while my wife went to a play at the Blumenthal downtown.

This space has been numerous other restaurants over the years with different cuisines from Italian (twice), Greek, French, Indian and Chinese. Not a bad location so I don't know why restaurants have such a problem here. Granted that management is part of the equation but several of the previous restaurants had both good management and great food.

In any case, I like Sushi and decided to give it a try.

The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the eclectic lighting, Dim lights and the accent colors are shades of magenta, blues and green, Reminds me of hour my room mate decorated our dorm room back in 1966. Not psychedelic  but getting close. Ourside of the lighting, the rest of the restaurant is tastefully decorated.

There is a notice as you walk in that is seeking to clarify the All You Can Eat Buffet to one with 50% off. Only good at certain times of the day and I left more confused than before I got there.

"I came here to get a screw removed from the back right tire of my dad's Jeep and have the tires rotated. A guy came out to my car and I showed him a piece of paper my dad gave me explaining which tire had the screw and what needed to happen. We checked both tires and when the guy didn't see anything in the right tire (it was probably on the bottom?) we checked the left and we both saw something that might have been a screw? but I didn't know what it looked like so I wasn't sure, I was just running an errand for my dad. I said ""well he wrote down right tire but I haven't seen it, so if you, with all your tire expertise, think that is a screw then check it out anyways,"" but I showed him the paper again. ""Right tire"" it says, ""back right tire."" The guy assured me they would check both and figure it out. Cool. I went inside and waited, watching them take all the tires off from the windowed lobby.

Even though I told him it was the right tire and showed him a piece of paper where my dad wrote ""RIGHT TIRE"", (holy SHIT did I mention I had a piece of paper with RIGHT TIRE written on it?) they still wrote down left tire and checked ONLY the left tire. I watched someone else check the tires because they were pretty busy, so I don't think it's 100% the first guys fault, something was clearly lost in translation to the second guy. But of course there wasn't anything in the left tire! God I can barely believe it, it's almost like my dad who owns the car and looks at the tires semi regularly knew that the screw was in the right one after all.

But instead of checking the left tire, finding nothing and, oh, I don't know, TELLING ME ABOUT IT, he just went to himself ""hey there was no screw!"", put the tires back on, told me nothing and let me leave thinking it was taken care of. 

Today my dad discovered the screw was still in his tire! Can you believe it! And him and my mom were both pissed at ME, because I didn't tell the tire shop to remove the screw! because ""they're professionals, they wouldn't make that kind of mistake!"" Well they did make that mistake! And hey nobody is perfect, I had no idea what the screw looked like I was just running some errands for my dear old dad, I'm not an auto technician that can see a 3 inch screw embedded into a Michelin with my naked eyeball. But instead of telling me ""hey we didn't find a screw in your tire, heehaa guess you made a mistake"" to which I would say, ""sorry dude but there's no fuckin way that's right cuz my father is a perfectionist and could probably feel that screw in his tire like the princess felt the god damn pea under 50 mattresses and you need to check again!"" But I never got a chance to say this because

They
Said
Nothing

They said nothing! They let me leave thinking the screw was found, removed, sent to the depths of hell where it belonged, and that the rest of the tires were rotated and everything was peachy. I don't see why it wouldn't cross their minds to mention to me that they didn't find a screw in the tire when it's the main issue I came for. I wasn't hiding from them, I was sitting in the lobby eating their free Dum-Dums and watching them take tires off my dad's car. At least tell me about it to double check? I could have shown them the paper again and been like hey look, it says ""RIGHT TIRE"", did you check the right tire? No? okay cool, it's the right tire, no big deal! No they just... let me leave... waved goodbye as I drove off into the sunset thinking the tires were screw-free. It's absolutely bizarre to me that this is what happened but whatever.

"I am rating my experience with Pete's Transmission as 1 star. I originally took my trailblazer there because it would not shift out of second gear after about an hour of driving. They took my truck on a test drive as well as hooked it up to a scanner and said I needed to have my transmission rebuilt. 
So on a Monday I dropped it off and by Thursday it was ready. The very next day I went to back out of the parking space at the store and the shift lever moves freely but the truck stays in park. So I had to leave my truck overnight. Pete's was closed due to a family event. In the meantime I had a friend tell me to check to see if the shift cable was connected to the transmission. Sure enough it had some how come loose. So I snapped it back together. And I was able to shift out of park and through all the gears. 
About 300miles later the truck started to take a long time(5-10seconds) to get up to speed from the stoplight, like it was in a higher gear or something. Again after it's been driven awhile. So I took it back to Pete's they kept it couple days then told me they changed one of the shift solenoids. After driving it a couple days it again started to do the same thing after coming to a stop. The truck once it gets warm it won't shift out of the higher gear. I took to Pete's again and they tell me that I have an ignition module problem. And that I need to take it to another shop they recommend to have them look at it. Oh by the way it would be $90 for them to look at. So long story short either Pete's charged me for a transmission rebuild I didn't need. Because it was always an electrical problem. Or the rebuild work they did was shoddy.  That's my experience with Pete's Transmission. 

Update to my experience. I took my truck to another transmission shop. They told me I did not have a module problem. They said they needed to disassemble the transmission to take a look. They allowed me to look at the parts that were supposedly replaced from the rebuild at Pete's aswell as parts that should have been replaced but we're not.  Since they rebuilt my transmission it has been running great. I was not happy with the price however  I think they way overcharged me $2700 was the total price. So I am not giving that shops name.

"I was excited to try this pizzeria but was disappointed and so was my friend who took me there.  We waited about forty minutes to get in, the place looks great but the pizza is about as Neapolitan as Hungarian Goulash.  The tomato puree is not like the real Italian tomato taste and seems flavored with sugar and citric acid, I don't know it just tastes funny.  I spend two months a year in the heart of naples and this is a very different tasting pie.  Even the mozzarella lacks the natural flavor and is so white as if it is bleached.  We were told this was the most amazing pizza around but it was no match for a few decent ones in San Francisco and on the East Coast.

If you sit-in instead of take-out, you'd order at the cashier who will then give you a number card to take back to your table. The food is then brought out by one of the staff.

Great view and great food all ten times I've been but the service unfortunately really lacks even on a slow weekday night. I know there are always unforseen obstacles a dinner crew faces at a restaurant but in Rustler's Rooste case things will happen such as a server dropping the food on a tray stand in front of the table without any word of what to do when it is clearly your food and then walking away. Almost every time I've been they forget someone's entree or side and the last time they outright forgot my entire table's salad.

"Waaaaaay overrated.  Breakfast was average in taste and quality at best. I got the tractor driver with eggs and potatoes.

"Considering Fox Concepts seem to engulf a massive chunk of Biltmore Fashion's restaurant space, it was only a matter of time before we'd finally pay a visit to Blanco Tacos. In short, it's pretty much what I expected. Slightly above average tacos served in a sleekly decorated setting, but not quite good enough to where I feel it's worth a revisit.

We ordered a variety of tacos to sample, including the carne asada, BBQ, carnitas, and roasted chicken. Nothing was really bad, but nothing really stood out as something mind-blowingly delicious. You have the option of either flour or corn tortillas. Both work fine.

As for sides, the butter-infused rice tasted great at first, as most things with butter always do. But after several bites, I had no desire to keep eating. The butter flavor should be more restrained, providing more of a subtle compliment rather than completely dominating the rice. The street corn suffers from a similar issue. The first few bites are the most enjoyable, until you can barely finish the remainder of the dish due to mayonnaise overload. The beans, on the other hand, were a stark contrast, as we couldn't really taste much flavor in them.

For dessert, we tried the Mexican Chocolate Cake. Although I maintain that it would work much better as a sponge texture, it was still decent in its harder form. The subtle hints of cinnamon and salt were both nice additions. With a scoop of ice cream, you can't really complain, although I'll probably forget I even ordered it within a few weeks.  

Our server was polite and the service itself was good. No issues with food quality. I'm sure if you're an entry-level taco fan or love margaritas, it'll do just fine for a gathering or date. But in a place like Phoenix that has such a heavy Hispanic culture, there's far too many other options to rely on Blanco as a go-to taco spot.",0.0

"Want to feel ignored, alienated with abysmal customer service? You're better off cutting your own nails at home than coming here which is what happened to me today. 

I walked in and asked if I could have a pedicure. There were 2 ladies on staff and only one had a customer. I assumed the second lady was JUST reception. She asked me if I wanted to have the service now which I said yes. She said I had to make an appointment which is understandable if only one lady was qualified to do it. Instead of offering me the next available time (the logical thing to do) she stared at her BLANK appointment book and hovered around a future date to ask what date I wanted.... I informed her that it looked like the next available appointment in her book would be in half an hour so I can come back then. She looked VERY confused, gave me a business card, asked me to call and then penciled me in...

Anyway I came back half an hour later and the lady who I assumed was the receptionist was giving a manicure to another customer... She didn't recognize me and asked if I'd like to make an appointment. I told her I spoke to her half an hour ago to make an appointment for right now. She sounded confused and asked me to sit and wait.

I waited another half hour and the customers both the ladies were working on were ONLY getting their nails buffed. Not even painted yet!

Maybe if I did I would've been taken seriously.

Our waiter plain and simply had charisma, energy and a good sense of humor. Nowadays, there are tablet computers at every table which can be used to do everything from Playing games, viewing a menu, calling for your server or paying a bill. Pretty neat technology. My kids kept themselves fully occupied the entire time. What wasn't neat was the $1.99 game fee they tack on your bill at the end. Was there a screen that alerted us to the fee? A click YES screen? Maybe, I don't know - but it would be a nice touch for someone to point this out when you are dining with kids (especially smart, tech savvy ones who like to purchase things when their father isn't watching).

The deep fried artichoke heart appetizer was probably the best thing I ate here all day; really nice dish served with a lemony aioli. Entrees come with your choice of unlimited breadsticks and soup or salad. I am a salad lover, so even though it was a fairly generic bowl of salad and dressing I could appreciate it. The kids enjoyed their meals (ate everything) and I like that it included the drink (no one likes a separate drink cost). The flatbread was okay but my chicken parmesan (you probably even tell in the picture) looked like that old lady on the beach who has been tanning so much she looks like a leather handbag. It was way overdone. Had I been given the opportunity, I would have told someone it was overcooked. ""Oh well"" I thought, ""I probably won't be coming back here anyway"". I know they serve \/cook a lot of meals here in a day, but this chicken should not have left the kitchen. I think this is probably a decent place to come during the week for a quick lunch but for more of a sit down situation, I prefer Romano's Macaroni Grill, Carrabba's or Maggiano's - the quality is like night and day. Even with the gift card, we owed an additional $30 - a pretty pricey lunch for a chain.",0.0

The fish has always been fresh (a must for any sushi place, of course) and the creators of the menu know when to not mess with traditional -- the nigiri is simply the fresh seafood and rice -- and when to mix it up -- the shrimp-based Super Crunch Roll has jalapenos mixed in which mirror the kick of the standard wasabi.

The menu is quite large with all the usual cuts of seafood and there are numerous rolls combining those options. The prices are also decent -- Jeannene and I usually spend about $100 and we feel full and a little tipsy with two drinks each.  Ahhh, Tsunami Night, how I miss you.

Their appetizer list is also extensive with a lot of traditional Japanese dishes or at least inspired ones. I always go with the spicy crab salad while Jeannene goes with the seaweed salad which are both fresh and lightly seasoned.

"My family and I were in the neighborhood so we decided to try it out. I've never been to a Lazy Dog Cafe but I heard good things about the one in Summerlin.
We went at about 14:00 so it pretty quiet, not very busy at all. We were seated promptly enough but it took close to 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by a server. A server did walk by and said that she would be right with us. 10 minutes later another server came and took our drink orders. In those 20 minutes though I saw other groups come in after us, get seated , and was immediately waited on by a server. The restaurant wasn't very busy and the staffing level was high enough than there should not have been any delays in service.
Our new server came back with our drinks and got our orders. Everything afterwards proceeded satisfactorily.

"For a 24 hr place, I'd like to think they'd be ready for customers at all hours of the night. 3 of us got off work and went over there at 3:30am. We couldn't tell if they were actually open because it was dark, the place looked absolutely trashed and we didn't see a single movement inside. If it weren't for the giant banner that said 24 hrs, we wouldn't have known they were open at all.  We see a guy emerge from the kitchen because I assume he saw our cars pull up, so we go inside. We order, pay, etc. I ordered a Coke with my wrap, but they didn't have fountains, just bottles. The only bottles I saw were in a tub of what used to be ice hours ago next to the register. I was not aware I was supposed to grab one of the room temperature Cokes that have been sitting there since who knows when and the cashier didn't seem interested in either getting a fresh one or offering a cup of ice. You know what, this is going to take all night, so I'll just break it down:

- 2 wraps and a salad took 20 min for the wraps and another 10 min for the salad to come out.
- 1 of the wraps was Thai chicken, and there wasn't a single piece of chicken on it. Not like it lacked a decent amount, the literal chicken part was missing.
- When told about the missing chicken, the worker who's name I can't recall but weighed about 60 lbs said, quote, ""Oh, yeaaah. I knew I forgot that part."" He knew and apparently thought no one would notice. The pregnant woman noticed and was not pleased.
- I can't tell how many interactions we had with the worker after that, but we did watch him change his gloves maybe twice, in between touching the doors to deliver food, constantly pulling his pants up, making other orders for the other people that came in, etc. 
- When my friend with the salad became extremely skeptical about the cleanliness of her food after not touching it because of the glove thing, she asked for a refund and while the worker offered a refund with no problem, he complained that he wasn't even supposed to be there. Cool story, bro. Doesn't mean you get to act careless when it comes to basic health code stuff.

How does a store like this with so many heavy items not have shopping carts? I asked an associate for one when I couldn't find any and she said they were all stolen. I asked how am I supposed to buy a 28lb bag of dog food? (I am visibly pregnant) She just shrugged.  I said ok I guess I won't shop here then and left. Wow wow wow.

"I really hate going from a 5 star to a poor review but feel like management needs to be informed of their business so they can provide the best services possible to their customers. I no longer live in the area but decided to get an eyebrow wax, as I was in the area. My technician was Blake, who was very informative about the waxing process, but she honestly offended me. In my consultation before the eyebrow wax, she asked if I wanted to get my lip waxed. I said ""no"" and she asked if I've ever had it waxed before. I said yes, once, and the hair grew back darker. She explained how if it's not done right that can happen and advised me not to wax myself. I received the lip wax service at a professional salon and never told her I did it myself at home. She just replied ""oh, well if you want to get your lip waxed, you definitely have plenty of hair for it so just let me know."" I was so appalled she said that I couldn't comment other than to repeat my previous ""no"" response. The eyebrow wax hurt really badly too, which is pretty unusual as I get regular eyebrow waxes. 

And, when I went to pay for the service, I noticed their prices increased from $16 to $18 for the eyebrow wax. That definitely didn't sit well either.

I really don't think I will be back. I know technicians have different styles and personalities but even as a salesperson and a technician, I think it's crossing a line to tell someone they have ""plenty of hair"" to get that area waxed. If it's offered and they say NO, move on!!!",0.0

The tables are quite uncomfortable, petty much sitting up on high stools and small wooden table tops. The service seemed a little slow but the staff was all super friendly !

"How does a new restaurant with a young, talented former sous-chef and so much potential, become so remarkably irrelevant in such a short time?
The answer is simple, actually.  
When an owner\/chef begins to believe that he is a rockstar, deserving of accolades and unconditional affection, but hasn't earned it, doesn't appreciate it, and worst of all- shows disdain for the very people lining his pockets every day, the writing is on the wall. 
The decor- Bauhaus chic- but we've seen this before. 
The waitstaff and hostess- pleasant, but fearful of  their leader, barely out of diapers with a napoleonic complex 
The food- good. But typical Tokyo style, nothing evolutionary or revolutionary. 
The value- don't get me started.  Our Chef\/Owner clearly doesn't know his neighborhood or clientele.   Over priced. 
But how do I possibly explain our overall experience?
Jackie Lin, who was just a gleam in his parents eye when I started eating sushi, picked the wrong brother when he began his 7PM seating by teaching me a condescending lesson about how to eat my sashimi.  I requested No Rice in order to respect my wife's gluten free diet. The restaurant was happy to oblige.  Chef Lin must of been the last to know because he began a nervous attack on both of us, saying how he never does this, and we should have been told so, building his tiny sashimi morsels angrily and serving the full selection of omakase bites on a singular dish, unabashedly throwing it in our faces like a dog getting his morning water bowl. 
My wife wanted to yell at him.  I quietly asked her to allow Mr. Lin to think about his actions and make up for the poor display. But he didn't.  
I actually think he believed we had never been to an omakase experience or visited a tasting menu before.  The passive insults kept coming.  I held it together.  ""Would you order pasta without the pasta?""  ""I carefully selected this fish to pair with my rice!""  ""You should have ordered the a'la carte"". Lin was completely thrown off his game by our simple request.  He couldn't concentrate.  His final dish to us was a tuna hand roll put together in haste, devoid of flavor, garnish or effort. We had to take it out of his hand because he refused to plate it. 
I think I know what Lin's problem is.  He's young. Merely 31, with very little experience catering to a demographic of experienced and discerning taste.  He lacks the customer skills that compatriots Mitsuhiro Kaji, Yasuhisa Ouchi and several others (we are lucky in this great city) have to handle the ferociously different and eclectic palates and array of customers that will inevitably step into his establishment. 
Here's some advise, Jackie:  Drop the bourgeois attitude (you're not Rob Gentile or Grant Van Gameron yet). 
Learn how to smile and appreciate the $250 we just dropped for 9 pieces of sushi and a couple of vodka sodas. 
Stop assuming you're the smartest guy in the room- you're just not. You haven't been on this planet long enough. 
Lastly, take my word on this- and I know what I'm talking about, having seen restaurants come and go weekly in this fickle, unadulterated foody town:  If you are trying to cater to the young-only, interweb generation and jetset crowd of new money and limited epicurean tastes- you are doing a great job of feeding them your kool-aid. But sooner rather than later, these same kids will be discovering sushi mastery worldwide, coming back to this fair city and realizing how one-dimensional this restaurant really is.
Either change the attitude, or lower your prices.  One of these measures should help you weather the storm that is this business.

I went to the store in Coral Springs FL based on an ad theyhad online. When I arrived I could not pull the ad and find which bike i was looking for. Rick in the bike department was extremely helpful and tried to assist the best he could. I left and went home to try to find the ad again and I did. I called the store and asked for the bike department Rick was on break so another associate assisted me I described the ad and he stated it was last years model but they do have the same model in store and would honor the price. When I arrived Rick was back from his break and said he had heard the conversation over the walkie talkie and congratulated me on getting a great deal on the bike. He went over the bike thoroughly and have some paperwork to bring up to the register when I arrived there I explained everything to the associate and he had to get a manager . A woman walks over and I show her the ad and she said she has to bring it up on their computers. She said the bike she pulled up is not on sale and I explained the conversation I had regarding honoring the price I showed the ad and she had to call the store manager Brian Mose. At this point I had already been at the store for about 30 min. Brian tells me he cannot honor the price and tells me he will give me 15% off of $499 bike which I was told prior to that would be $224.98 the advertised online price. He said he would try to find one of the bikes like the one advertised and I said that would be fine. After waiting for about 20 minutes he said he found one in Georgia but it will take 2-3 weeks to arrive at this location. I told him that would be fine. He calls the Georgia store and the tell him it is damaged. He says he will give me 15% off of the $499 bike but that is it.

Worst place to live For the price. Maintenance dont fix anything. if thay do it will be months later. Rent is to high for A\/C Not to be working. Management wants to fine you for every little thing. They never have the utilities with the rent  . The apartments look nice but thats it. Don't wast your time here theres better places.,0.0

But first, let's give some points for the decor. Really liked the cleanliness and brightly lit space. Friendly staff too. Unfortunately, there were not enough seats for larger groups, but hey! It's a ""bar"" right? So we stood whilst eating--much more comfortable than sitting. 

Ordered the ""build your own"" option: mixed greens, half and half tuna and salmon, ponzu sauce, sweet onions, green onions, edamame, seaweed salad, tobiko, and roasted seaweed and added $1 for avocado. Ingredients were quite fresh and fitting to eat for the summer.

However, was very sad that the avocados in the bowl were tiny little cubes instead of what was advertised as reasonable sliced pieces. Nonetheless, was still tasty.

Liked this place, but unable to give more stars because $13.50 was way too steep for such small portions. It was good but not worth the value. May come back to try the Nachos? Hopefully will have a better impression by then. 

Feedback: The lights are suspended too low to the point where we were boiling. Maybe elevate them higher? Ohh!

I've since seen 2 different dermatologist one through ins and one I paid for Bc I was afraid to be brushed off again. Both agreed something is definitely wrong. I had a skin biopsy taken and was given two prescriptions to help with possible infections or parasites and for inflammation or if I develop any itching and was told ""don't worry we will get to the bottom of this and get you better"". I work in medicine and I am educated, but regardless I am a patient and no patient should EVER be treated so poorly. He told me I was ""crazy"".

The steak was well-cooked and of good quality, but the pieces were were large and chunky, which made it impossible to take bites of my sandwich with ease. The size of the bun was far too large and overwhelming and did not complement the innards of the sandwich very well.

"This is a review of my multiple experiences with this place:

1. Tuesday Nights: We play trivia in the bar\/restaurant section every Tuesday night. The trivia folks are well organized, the sound system is perfect, the audio visit has a million screens. The room is beautiful, they have good lighting, a variety of booths and tables, even two billiards tables. There is a cozy couch and chair set up by a fireplace which is nice. There are prizes to be won. Every time they have specials which I suggest ordering. We have ordered off the regular menu and that is okay but ""usually"" the specials shine, and are a better value. My only exception was last night. My chicken parmigiana sliders looked more like a little Chick Fil A nugget on a bun. I saw others get served more appropriate portions of chicken. The photo is attached. The only disappointment I have with the staff is that I said something to two different servers, I never saw a manager, but no attempt to fix my food was made. The service is okay but you can tell the servers are more used to be runners than actual servers. 

2. Bowling on Sunday: We were disappointed to find out the gift cards we won on Tuesday could only be used in the arcade but not on the bowling. The guy at the counter was kind. We sat in the restaurant area to wait for our lanes and eat dinner, we didn't realize that the restaurant wasn't staffed. There is no bartender at the bar and no servers. We went to the food counter and ordered our food. There were no specials that day, so we just ordered off the menu. The food was bar fare, which was fine. 

The lanes are nice, the team area is lounge feeling, the scorekeeping technology is top notch.

STRIKE THREE was not receiving an estimate at all, even after reaching out FOUR DAYS later to let them know I was still interested and would like to see an official estimate.  It's been 10 days since I met with the contractor and I still haven't received an email back, in that time I was able to find another company (AllHeatingandAirConditioning) to give me an estimate and install my system.

"Wow what a horrible experience. Me & my boyfriend had been planning on going to this place for months now and we finally were able to go for brunch! What a regret.

As the server brought back our drinks she said ""I have two questions for you. This isn't the question but are you guys dating?"" We stated yes. She then continued with ""If you guys continue dating is it important she gets along with your mother?"" Well my boyfriends mom unfortunately passed away a few years ago. So that was awkward. She then asked if it was important we have the same religion.

"UPDATE -- I managed to track down the manager of the Charlotte location on LinkedIn and he resolved my issue immediately.

When I rented my car, everyone was polite and attentive, and the car was brand spanking new--it even still had the new-car smell.  They gave me my choice of half a dozen vehicles with no change in price, which was nice--I went with a Toyota because that's what I drive at home. 

Dropoff was quick and painless.  I returned my car and was told by the Advantage agent to simply leave my keys in the car and go.  I returned home to find that I had been billed for an extra day and a half of rental service--the agents didn't bother processing my return until the next time the car was rented.  I have called their customer service line, emailed them, complained on Twitter and Facebook, and disputed the charge through my credit card company--and they told the credit card company that I had kept the car for an extra day and thus the charges were justified--even though I had already emailed them my boarding pass from Jetblue to show that I had left for Boston the day I dropped off the vehicle.  I wasn't physically IN Charlotte for the period of time they say I was renting the car.

"This is a CRAPRIOTTI'S

   Capriotti's is a casual fast food restaurant chain that specializes in cold and warm subs. Their signature sandwich: the Bobbie was voted the best sandwich by AOL in 2009. Regardless that the majority of the 106 Capriotti's are in Las Vegas, their first location was established in Delaware back in 1976. Unfortunately, I am reviewing a different place than Capriotti's because the place that I stepped inside of yesterday fails to abide by company promotions. This is a review on a Crapriotti's abbreviated Crap that is Capriotti's in name. 

   I have yet to try a Capriotti's sandwich. When I look at Yelp pictures, my mouth salivates because they look good. Capriotti's - THAT MEANS EVERY LOCATION-was promoting the 2 For 2. The promotion is that you get a 6 inch sandwich and soup for $2. The promotion was active til the 19th. After work, I made a beeline for this location. Squeezed in between Eastern Avenue, Serene Avenue, Interstate 215, and shops; the parking lot is difficult to get in n Out of. Ha! That's funny because In N Out is in the parking lot. If the experience was good the ordeal of the compacted and congested parking lot would be worth it. 

   Upon walking inside one of the few kids working here  greeted me. I let him know that I wanted the 2 for 2 promotion. He informed me that this franchise owner was not doing this promotion and that I would have to drive to the Anthem location. He'd tell another customer the exact thing. Interesting! Next to me was a mutant  picture sign promoting the 2 for 2. The kid went on to say that the franchise owner also took the promotion off this location's Facebook page. 

  The 2 for 2  developed into a 1 for 1. This would be my one and only visit here and I was going to rate it 1 star. This franchise owner is not a team player. It is pure greed to not abide by a company promotion and consequently cheat customers out of their time and to shove the money losing promotion on the back of another franchisee. This is a franchise owner that is penny wise and dollar foolish. Capriotti's did not come up with this promotion to loose money. No way! The idea was to introduce customers to their sandwiches and hoping they will return. In addition to the greed, I distrusted the kids making the sandwiches. When I walk in a restaurant and see all kids minus management, a mental red flag appears. And when the kid is telling me that Silverado Ranch Road, which is two traffic signals south on Eastern is Anthem that is three miles south; I don't want him making my food. In a way it is a good thing that this franchisee didn't abide by the company promotion. 

   In the future it is a possibility that I will try my first Capriotti's sandwich at the Anthem location. But never will I return to this Crapriotti's unless I see the ""Under New Ownership""  sign that could make this location  worthy of the Capriotti's name.",0.0

I've been craving wings all week so when I passed this place, it was perfect timing and meant to be. My choice of seating was at the bar, since I was alone. The bar tender, George, while polite, reminded me of a recently released inmate with his teardrop tattoo and over use of the phrase ""Boss-Man"" to each patron. 

My food was delivered by a runner, who repeated my order out loud to assure it was correct while placing it in front of me. I should have taken a picture of the plate as it appeared the chef was saving the Honey Haberñero sauce for someone else's order. These wings were Sahara Desert dry.  Not only dry but extremely over cooked. The celery appeared as if it had been used by an angry sous chef as there was not one piece which did not look like bad split ends on over processed hair. 

Thank goodness for the luck of a random stranger at the bar to talk to and a nice glass of tea to wash it all down. 

The bar tender reappeared at my end to deliver the check which was quickly paid for an expedited departure. Never once was I checked on to assure that my order was correct or tasted OK.

"First time here, the waiters seem really stressed and overworked although they are very friendly you can tell that they are barely keeping it together, kind of feel bad for them. But the main issue with this place is the wait time for the food . I came in right around 8:15  and was seated, I had the lamb shawarma plate. I didn't receive my food till 9:00. 45 min was way too much time, I only complained once though, and my food came out after that. But there were a lot of mad customers who were also waiting too long for their food and complaining. Time is money . As far as the food goes, the lamb shawarma was ok not great, pretty oily and kind of salty imo, rice was ok, and the ""house salad"" is just like two slice of a tomatoes a couple slivers of onions, on like 5 pieces of lettuce. The one star is for actually getting my food. 12.99 for the lamb shawarma I don't mind, but u get reemed on the can of Coke that is 2.50 yes a can not a fountain drink, that is what made me mad. Oh also watch out for the 15% gratuity that's automatically added to the bill. I woulda tipped more but hey they did it for me. This place has potential, but needs a lot of work in getting the food to the customer on time. Shoulda just gone to mint India bistro next door.",0.0
"Meh, I've never had an exceptional experience here.  Some pros are it's location and it's proximity to me and the variety of the menu.

I've been here on many occasions and it's never really my first pick. But then you look at the menu, and you think for a second it might turn out just fine. It always goes downhill after you're seated. Incredibly long wait times for the wait staff to get your drinks, your orders, and then your food. Plan to be here a few hours. 

My last visit was during brunch. Boy does the brunch menu look fantastic, but execution just was not there. I ordered the chicken and waffle. If you like your chicken extra extra extra crispy, you might enjoy their chicken. If you like a dense waffle, you might like their waffles. For me, everything was just a bit too tough to chew on.

"The staff are very friendly and nice. However! The quality of the treatment varies wildly with the technician. I had a total of 4 different technicians use laser on me. Some were thorough but not all. They will short change you on time for your treatment, which means your treatment will not be nearly as effective as it should be.  They will also stretch out the appointments to minimize the number of treatments instead of being mindful of timing the appointments for efficacy. With laser you need treatments closer together at the start of treatment and then they can be spaced out more.  Some of the technicians are not careful about eye protection at all. I had to request the metal eye protectors. One technician just wanted me to use some regular old sunglasses which may or may not have even had UV protection. Another thing, they had a birthday promotion for a free massage. I made an appointment, then they cancelled it  and wouldn't reschedule.

The $4 cream puff on the other hand left me feeling pretty ripped off. Now normally you would never hear me complaining about paying premium prices for pastries (because come on, it's an art form) but it was literally just a regular old cream puff, not too different from the kind you can buy in bulk at Costco.

"This place is horrible, from the moment I stepped foot in the establishment to the very last interaction I had with the waitress - I was left with a bad taste in my mouth and it wasn't just from the biscuits and gravy.  I was in Vegas for work, every moment of my down time was spent at the Wynn property and I cannot say enough great things about my overall experience at this hotel - the room was beautiful and the casino is very well organized and great.  With that being said, the experience I had at this cafe this morning will likely result in me never giving Wynn another dime.  I gambled all night on Tuesday 3\/8\/16 @ the Wynn and as a result the casino host comped me and my business partner our breakfast at the terrace point cafe.  As soon as I walked in I found myself waiting in line to be seated in a pretty much empty establishment, literally waited patiently for 5 minutes for whatever reason is unknown to me.  Upon seating, it took at least 10 minutes to get our beverages, my water was never topped off.  Numerous employees walked by my empty water several times.  At one point I got up out of my seat and walked over to the bar to get my water refilled myself, the bartender proceeded to key punch something in the computer and didn't even look up at me or greet me even though I was hovering and in obvious need of assistance.  When I finally interjected, he didn't even let me say what I needed and told me that he'll ""be right back"" with an annoyed tone.  The food was just mediocre, nothing special.  The steak I had with my eggs was extremely fatty for a strip and was very thin, the biscuits and gravy are an outright abomination. Given the fact that this eatery is located on the Wynn property, I figured it would be paired with a ""Wynn"" level of service, I was wrong.

At 8:30am I called the office and ""John Scalon"" the owner answered.   I stated ""Good Morning, I am expecting a estimate this morning and want to make sure we are still on your schedule. He rudely responded ""How did you get my number?"".   His rudeness continued as I explained that ""April"" stated they would arrive closer to 8am and he responded ""you have a two hour window and if you dont like it find someone else"".

"We have had dinner several times at this restaurant, and attempted to enjoy it again there a year ago and so looked forward to it.  (We were bringing friends, and had talked about it so much over the years).  The service was beyond disappointing.  We waited 45 minutes to be seated  although we had reservations ( and had asked to be seated outside when we made the reservations) only to be seated next to the private room where a very loud party was going on.  We asked to be moved outside...we were accommodated, and it was odd that few of the tables were being used.  We got a half baked explanation about wait stations, etc.  The food was fine, but not exceptional. The bill was enormous for the experience.  Our friends have not stopped talking about how disappointed they were.  Sadly, we are about to make our yearly trip from New York to Scottsdale again, and for the first time we will not be returning to this restaurant",0.0

Not sure if they even used egg.  I asked for our check when the waitress finally returned to our table (no offer on refill of drinks) in a restaurant w\/o AC.

"We're new to Nevada and have been dreading our visit to the DMV for new plates and licenses.

We were a bit surprised to find 25+ people already in line, but obviously they didn't want to devote their entire day to it either.

"Awful customer service. Stay away!!!

I came in as a walk-in for a wash, blow dry and style at 10:30am on a Saturday morning, receptionist told me they had time for me in about 10 minutes. I let her know that I was hoping to be done by 11:40am and she said this would not be a problem. The stylist took me back at around 10:55am, at which point she realized that I wanted a style (curls) and did not have time to take me. She gave me to stylist Billy instead as he did not have any upcoming appointments.

Billy was bit rough with my hair wash but as I had product in it I figured he was just being thorough. I let him know that I wanted to leave at 11:40 like I had told the receptionist. Billy said this would be tight but I should be out within 5-10 minutes of that time because each curl would need time to set. Billy was talkative and I told him that it was my bachelorette party that day so I had decided last minute to treat myself. He made a number of comments about how I needed to be out on time. I said it was fine if we were a bit late. I was concerned about the product he was using on my hair before curling it because the bottle said ""hair drying spray"" and when I read the label, it indicated that ""hold: 0, shine:1"". Billy told me that this was what was giving my hair the curl shape and that he uses it all the time, before curling and setting with hairspray.

I left at 12:00pm and was relatively happy as my hair looked great.

By 2:00pm I could feel my hair starting to fall, and when I had a friend take a picture at 3:30pm, there was almost no curl left at all. Disappointed that I had paid $55+tax and tip, I returned to see if they could fit me in to touch up my hair. Unfortunately, the power was out at the mall due to a storm. I spoke with Billy and asked what he could do for me. He said that normally he would touch me up but there was nothing he could do with the power out. I then asked if a refund was an option since the service I had paid for was not delivered. Billy made a number of rude and disrespectful comments, telling me that the texture of my hair was the problem, that he would've used a tighter curling wand but I told him not to, that I 'rushed' him, and that he came to work expecting to be able to work the whole day and ""not make $20"", so why was I complaining.

I tried to calmly explained that I have never had a problem with my hair holding curls from another salon, and that I am able to do my hair at home and with the right products it will hold curls. Billy told me that it wasn't the product that he chose because he has used it on ""hundreds of clients"". At this point he was visibly agitated and was speaking loudly. 

Another stylist came over and spoke to me. She was also rude and condescending and told me that she had a number of Asian friends with hair like mine and when she does their hair, it does not hold curls either. She then pointed to my friend and said that her hair would obviously hold curls better than mine because of it's texture. I again explained that this did not make any sense because I have never had that problem, but if that were the case, Billy should not have assured me that my hair would last all day, or made it clear that this is what I should have expected. I again asked if a partial refund would be possible since the service I paid for was not delivered. She said ""you're not listening, WE DON'T DO REFUNDS. WE DON'T DO REFUNDS. WE DON'T DO REFUNDS"". 

I then stated that I felt this was bad customer service. I stated that while I understood that they would fit me in to fix it if the power were working, I should not have even had to come back to get it fixed. Billy came over and got in my face and said a few more rude and disrespectful things (that I can't even remember because I was so upset and trying not to lose my cool) at which point my friend jumped in because she was quite upset for me. He then turned to her and said ""Who are you, the voice? Who do you think you are?""

When I asked to speak with a manager, I was told there was not one present and no other follow-up was offered. No apology for the bad styling, or the horrendous customer service.

I work really close to this location so I frequently do the rapid pick-up. The rapid pick-up allows you to order your food online and choose what time you what to pick it up. Usually when I do this it's ready for me right when I walk in and I'm in and out in a minute. The only problem I have is recently there have been a lot of orders that have been incorrect. I would say about 50% of the time something is missing from an order. I recommend you check your bag whenever you do take out from here just to make sure you have everything you ordered. My office did a large order a few weeks ago and had to go back because a lot of items were missing. I've never had this issue at other locations but maybe it's because this is a busier one? Just check your bag before you leave!,0.0
"Went for a Wild Card NFL playoff game on a Saturday night with a friend. We both ordered beers, I got a Troegs (can't believe bw3 had such a non mainstream beer) and friend got an ipa. Server said friend had to get his beer in a sniffer due to its high abv. I got mine in a pint glass. Later we compare notes and figure out both our beers have the same abv. Not only did friend not get what he ordered, he got the wrong beer in a smaller glass, losing valuable liquid gold. He would have sent it back but our server was awol for quite awhile. Later on I ordered the garden something app with hummus. It was served w\/o hummus and I was told it'd be out in 30 seconds. Then told they were out. Server looked shocked when I refused it. Thankfully they did have hot pretzels in stock. Bathroom was dirty. BW3 is America's super generic sports bar.

"As a steakhouse you can't go wrong, food was fantastic, however sadly that is where the accolades stop. Service was no where near the class this restaurant commands and deserves. I rated this a three only because the food was a five but the service was between a zero and one.

"French press is a brewing process, not a type of coffee!!!

This was my first visit and I was hopeful for a good experience. I visit MANY coffee houses and Carnegie has quite a few stars so I was anxious to stop in.

Unfortunately, my first impression is not good.

To begin, the young lady behind the counter greeted me but not with a smile or ANY enthusiasm.

Then, when I asked if they serve French pressed coffee she smugly, and somewhat rudely, replied ""Uh, no, this is an Italian coffee shop.""

It is? Where is the sign?

And by the way, young lady, French press is a technique, not a coffee type. You CAN French press Italian - or any other type - coffee!

Obviously, the folks behind the counter need more education on coffee brewing techniques.

The coffee itself was uninspired; though the biscotti was delicious and fresh.

The decor, which is raved over quite a bit herein, was, indeed, unique; however, virtually ALL the upholstered chairs (and these were the main seating offered) were\/are covered in stains. Pretty disgusting actually.

To add to the less than stellar experience; the same young lady who does not understand what ""French pressing"" is, was cleaning the floors and bathrooms. This in itself is fine and to be expected. The problem was the potency of the cleaning solution. Wow! When I'm in a coffee shop I want to smell coffee, not chemicals. They permeated the entire shop...both floors.

All-in-all a mediocre experience.

I do not see myself rushing back here when there are so many other great prospects ion the offing.",0.0
"Particularly upset with this range. A buddy and I snagged a groupon for range rental for 2 and planned on heading down there. He had never been there before, so he checked the hours on the website. He also looked on Facebook for pictures of the range because he was curious how it was set up. 

We make the 45-minute drive to the range and find a piece of paper on the door that they are closed for a few days until Friday. Really? That was the best way you could inform people? Not by modifying the hours on your website? Or posting it on Facebook? Or literally anything? I called and someone answered. They were making updates to the facility. Fine. JUST POST SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. The guy who answered was adamant that he had been posting about it for a month. They didn't. I checked. They did post about a delayed opening once for May 8th, so that's nice I guess... The groupon expired and we lost out on range time. No good.",0.0
"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE SERVICE i call this restaurant for delivery minimum 2-4 times a week ,i spend minimum 15$-30$+ on some bills and i give minimum tip of 4$+ and this is the CRAP SERVICE WE GOT:

Monday June 6 2016 i ended my work shift and came home to realise i forgot to defrost some meat..I was starving and was in no mood to cook ,i had a co worker friend with me who was hungry too.
At 3:13pm i rang up Mont-Royal hot dog and placed a order for : trio all dressed Le Mont-Royal 10"" submarine comes with fries and a 7up drink.A young woman's voice answer and took my order.
I had a friend with me and he chose a Large Italian poutine only. I had a few incidents in the past (2 total)with this restaurant once they forgot the drink of the trio and once they sent me a  wrong order!
I live about 8-10  minute walk from this restaurant so you would think delivery would be fast...Well it is not the case..remember i placed my order at 3:13pm and it was going on 4:00pm and the order still had not arrived. 
We were STARVING BY THEN....ONE HOUR + WAIT,i got pissed and called back the restaurant to ask if our food was coming or not.
The waitress sounded like she just wanted to get rid of us and she says on the phone with a attitude :""The delivery on its way ""then she hung up on my face...

4:15pm  still no food,it has been by now a 1 hour wait for a submarine trio with a Large poutine..I call back and demand to speak to the owner\/boss\/manager because i find it unacceptable to wait 1 hour for food.The waitress refused to let me speak to the owner telling me he was busy every time i asked ..I told her i am busy too..i am waiting +1 hour by now for food that will cost me 31$ and be COLD!!!

No apology,no humanity,she did not give a shit.During the conversation with the waitress refusing to let me speak to the owner\/boss\/manager i was standing on my balcony finishing up the call when the delivery guy shows up,i refused the order because it was COLD!!!!
 I told the delivery guy sorry i wanted warm food and 1 hour wait for cold crap i told the guy bye bye and told him to tell his boss i ordered from PIZZA MEGA .I got my sub trio and a regular poutine for my friend,cost me 23$ +tip and the delivery took -33 minutes!!!!!
The delivery guy was polite,food was warm,tasty and fast DELIVERY!.

So Mont -Royal hot dog is not a place i suggest you order delivery from.Unless you like cold crap and TERRIBLE SERVICE.

Caketini is a cute shop in San Tan Village that I have passed by on numerous occasions and finally decided to frequent to get some sweet treats to celebrate my husbands 30 birthday. 

The customer service is great and the gals were happy to answer my questions about flavors and price. The presentation is very charming and there was a nice selection of flavors available... I did go at 10:30 am when they opened. 

To me, the prices are reasonable for the size the cupcake--  however, the flavors were lacking to my disappointment.

I selected the salted caramel, red velvet, cookie dough and lemon raspberry. The cookie dough is great and is really like having two desserts in one. The lemon raspberry had no lemon or raspberry touch at all. Which was quite disappointing because the combo could have been amazing, had it any taste. Red velvet icing was great! You can taste the cream cheese and the cake itself was just the right density. As for the salted caramel.. No flavor. Nothing. Like eating a fluffy cloud. So if you're into that -- go for the salted caramel.

"Let's start with the fact that the tables here are clean. This alone is a first for the west-valley as most places can't or don't bother to clean their tables between customers.

You've got the poles there for this, use them. Our soups have been consistently good with the clam chowder running a bit thin. Standard coke-brand drinks along with some good-tasting infusion choices, too. We like the little strawberries at the end of the meal.

"This is for a special occasion only, but if you have one (birthday, anniversary, proposal - we had one while we were dining - she said yes!).  Great spot if you can't make the trek over to Paris and see the real thing.  This is a pretty good way to spend an evening.  Asked for a window table and we got a great one with a view of the Bellagio Fountains and the beautiful floor show every 15 minutes out the window was spectacular.  You should note, that there is a dress code for this place.  Guys have to wear a collared shirt.  I didn't and was handed a white kitchen shirt upon arrival...not my taste.  I did not go in a tank top and shorts either.  I wore a nice pair of slacks, dress shoes and a collarless red v-neck designer shirt that was way nicer than some of the unironed things I saw throughout the evening.  A simple reminder from the hotel would have made that less awkward for an otherwise nice birthday dinner.  A great wine list, but had to ask for it.  Good selection of US and French options.  I chose the French - duh!  But it was really from France, not a mock up.  A most excellent Bordeaux that was perfect with the meal.  The bread is offered per slice and a nice mix of options, but the butter reminded me most of Paris, so that was good on anything they offered.  I chose the Beet Salad for the appetizer.  Also really great.  This looked like it was going to be a four star restaurant on food, but the steak was only so-so.  Cooked good enough, but it was a little bland.  A Morton's or Ruth's Chris steak is sizzling hot when delivered and smothered in butter, but this one, well, cooked decent, but just didn't have the experience of a terrific steak.  I had the red wine sauce as a side, which helped it along.  For dessert, we shared a Caramel Souffle and that was a nice end to the meal.  Very light and airy, and who doesn't like caramel?  The waiter also brought me a mini-Chocolate Mousse which was a bonus.  Plus choice of a small petit-four - I picked the Salted Caramel.

You know I visit this Cookout quite often at least twice or more a week and I'm just not impressed.  They have only one drive thru line and are quick to toss your food out the window with little to no regard for order accuracy.  I have gotten into the habit of checking my orders before I leave the window here.  So the majority of the star rating here is on speed of service but quality and hospitality need major improvements.  This location has a dining room as well but it just replaces a normal Cookouts' walk-up window.  They do not really keep things clean and there is always sticky residue from drinks and sweet tea at the drink stations inside.  The last time I went my BBQ sandwich wasn't too hot telling me it hasn't spent long enough cooking on the char grill.  On multiple occasions they run out of sweet tea on the inside and when customers tell employees about it they have a bit of an attitude.  If this was my cookout we would have to tighten some things up.   Sweep your floor people and clean up the mess it makes us wonder about your sanitation.,0.0

"This review is for the office & office manager. I recently had dental implant surgery done and needed a crown & abutment. I was recommended to come here from my oral surgeon so I called and got a quote. At first I was told it would be $1300 and my insurance does not cover any of it so I would have to pay for it 100%. I called back and decided to go for it but then the ""office manager"" answered and requoted me $1800. I was not happy about that she had told me there's an additional cost for parts attachments etc, trusting in my oral surgeons recommendation I agreed. although I was not happy that suddenly I'm being charged $500 more for whatever reason my gut feeling told me something was not right. But I went for it I was trying to make a Monday apmt and they had nothing available I had told them I have a bz work schedule but I did want to try to squeeze in this apmt before I went on my 2 vacation so I scheduled their soonest which was Thursday. I woke up not feeling well so I called the office to reschedule  Stacey who answered was very nice and accommodating but then the ""Grinch"" office manager picked up the phone and went off on me saying how it's an inconvenience and she will need to charge me $35 for rescheduling.

Working Pumps- Not exactly. Every single pump has a broken receipt machine. One has to go inside to get receipts. So w\/ staffing issues, it  adds to the checkout line. 

Get Go Specials, Promotions etc stocked- Nope, rarely, or never. Don't expect for the items the app entices you to come and get to be there. They're not. 

RedBox- Broken each time I've tried to use it. Well, not every time. I got a dvd once. Couldn't return it of course. 

Overall this location is just shocking. Well, not shocking sinceI regularly use the South Side but rather, dismal in a cramped corners kind of way. I feel extremely uncomfortable entering the store since it's understaffed. This store needs to be staffed correctly. Machines must be fixed. 

The good thing about the broken machines is that it keeps an ongoing line at checkout. It is reassuring that the store is always backed up with customers trying to check out. That way, as a female customer you won't ever find yourself alone with anyone working there who is an offender. 

 Corporate needs to give this store the keys for success. It is obvious they are missing.",0.0
One star is one too many for this location. I meet my fiancée here two years ago so we came back to celebrate w a drink and a meal today. After 20 minutes we had not even been greeted. Then when we asked to see the manager and the waitress talked to him he walked the other way. I had to chase him down just to express my displeasure. Save yourself and the wasted time. Don't stop here.,0.0
"I created a Yelp account specifically for this office. I had taken 2 hours time off work this morning for an MRI on my hip. I was told the appointment was scheduled for the office located in Desert Ridge, yet when I get there they say I have to go to their Thompson Peak location. The assistants in the office merely circled a vague circle on a map and told me to go find it. After sitting through rush hour traffic and lots of searching, I finally find the office just in time for my appointment. I walk in, fill out the appropriate paperwork, and await to be called back. I am called up by the administrator, and she says that the radiologist scheduled today isn't authorized to perform my procedure. Basically, they cancelled my appointment as I was in the office.

I am appalled by this lack of communication and how I was treated. Normally I am fairly understanding of situations, and more than likely would have rescheduled. But now I plan on even changing my doctor because of the simple fact that they only use SimonMed.",0.0
"Small menu and don't have boba tea etc. I ordered a pork sandwich which was about 10-12 inches for $7.00. It was alright, not the best for $7.",0.0
"We had a similar experience as some others. No greeting from the Hostess totally dos not make eye contact or welcome us or make any attempt to acknowledge us coming in the door. She was checking out a customer but still had time to look up since she had to wait for credit card machine to process the bill plenty of time to greet incoming customers. When she was done with this check out she was going to check out another person instead of greeting us but the gentleman deferred and asked her to take care of us first ""Thank You Sir"" a true caring person. So she seated us finally. We had the chicken Parmesan and it was very good plenty enough to share between my wife and I. We asked the waitress and found out the rude woman hostess is the owner. I was going to let it go but after reading the other reviews with the same comments I felt I needed to share this also since it seems not to be an isolated incident. To sum it up the food was great and service from waitress good but the owner needs to hire a hostess with personality and then sit in a back office and count receipts out of sight of the customers.",0.0
"My first time at Auto Bell (S Tryon) and I am less than pleased. I purchased the ""Special C"" Package $25.99 I told the admitting attendant about the big splatter of bird poop on my car and he reassured me that it would be cleaned. When another attendant gave me my car back the poop was still there. I have a black car it's not hard to notice it. He clearly dried my car off with the poop, it's not until I pointed it out that he took a rag and wiped the poop off. 

Second thing all of my personal belongings were thrown on the ground! My combs, my sons gloves, my HANDICAP sticker? I mean if you're going to remove items from my vehicle PLEASE put it back, don't leave me to retrieve my items then have to approach you about where my handicap sticker is. Which I found it in a puddle of water ruined! Who is running this establishment? Sadly I purchased a package but don't feel as though I will be back. Totally mistreated my property and overlooked obvious issues I had in regards to the bird poop on my car..",0.0
"I've tried too many ramen and one is just average. Nothing extra ordinary. The broth was too thick and oily for my taste and the flavor is lacking. Although the pork is tender and juicy.
The place is too small as compared to the number of customer hence, the long line.",0.0
