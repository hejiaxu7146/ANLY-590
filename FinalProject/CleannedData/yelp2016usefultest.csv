This is my first experience with Physical therapy and I must say it is the best. I was told that it would hurt and such but it has helped me tremendously. If I was to recommend anyone to PTL this would be the place. They actually care for you and your comfort but yet they striped to help me get my hand moving. I even came in sick and they gave me great advise on how I should handle it. Thanks Guys,1.0
I've known Dr. Foster for a very long time. He's always been the most attentive and detail-oriented person I know. I wouldn't go to anyone else for my orthodontic needs.,1.0
"Step back in time and lose yourself in electromechanical heaven for two hours!! Or three or four!!! Wow, this place opened in December and is pinball heaven on earth!! I play a lot of pinball, but these machines are rare treats in an LED world. Buzzers, bingos, bumpers, drop targets, flags and double bonus points are music to the ears, but the vinyl 45 jukebox kicking out everything from mod rock to classic county made for an unforgettable soundtrack!!

My doctor recommended the Lou Ruvo Center. In June I left 3 messages to schedule an appointment. No one called me back. I waited 3 weeks. On the 4th try someone answered the phone. The only appointment they could give me was 2 months latter in August. I took the appointment which was supposed to be this Friday & I just received a call that they didn't schedule enough time for me so they have to change my appointment until the end of September. One would think in the 2 months I was waiting for this appointment they would have seen there was not enough time scheduled for my appointment. It gets one to thinking how efficient this place is. Maybe I'm better off that they cancelled my appointment.,1.0
"I understand the negative press Rhino sometimes get, but I love this place! Discovered it more than a year ago when me and a friend were walking around the area and were famished! Needless to say, Rhino did its job! The nachos are amazing, and well layered and oven baked and the price is yet to be rivaled with! I like the relaxed and unpretentious vibe you get here where you can just bring you and your friends or whoever and enjoy good food and conversation. Service is okay. But I come here for food, cosy vibe, and prices. Check it out and be the judge. Tip: if you're not into sports don't come during a big event gets too crowded and the focus isn't on food but drinks, but that's with many other bars too",1.0
"This establishment may be small but it is great.  The food is excellent, everything I have tried so far has been good.  I think I am addicted to there grits.  I could eat them everyday.  They are creamy and just the right consistently.  I have ordered them for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Yes they are all that.  There yams are die for and the macaroni and cheese is great. The catfish is really good.  For some reason I can just eat the sides.  Love there home fried potatoes.  I just ordered the chicken fried steak and gravy, haven't tried it, but it looks good.  Tomorrow I tackle the chicken wings, I understand there is a special on Thursdays.   Don't forget to try the lemon cake,  you will love it.

I have talked so much about the food but let me mention the service is excellent.  Staff tries really hard to make sure you have everything.  They were busy on Sunday but I was still greeted. with a smile.  It is probably better to order take out.  If it is crowded it can be a challenge to find a seat.  There is seating outdoors when the weather warms up.",1.0
"This place has been around for months now and I was finally able to check it out, even though I live literally down the street.  Over the years that I have lived in the area, though, I've noticed that this location hasn't brought much luck to the tenants. Sofi's is probably the 3rd to take over the spot.  Fingers crossed that they'll be able to establish themselves nicely and as fortunate as say, Fratelli's, which is located at the same plaza and has been an icon at Old Kingston Rd., along with Ted's.

Their menu is quite extensive especially when it comes to tacos, which is nice.  They also do offer more of the Canadian type dishes such as poutine, wings, mac and cheese, which makes this a great place for a group that includes the foodies and the not-so-foodies.  Not only that, you can order from their pretty large specials menu so that your party can try many various dishes.  One thing I must add is that their presentation is beautiful! Makes you feel as though you're in a higher end type of restaurant 

Elotes: A nice start to a meal if you're gangsta enough to be sporting some pieces of corn stuck in yo teef.  The queso fresco was deliciously complimented with the paprika sprinkled on.  I just personally wished that the corn wasn't over-boiled.  I like to have that nice pop and crunch when I eat corn on a cob.  This was a little to mushy to me, but the flavor made up for it.  4.5\/5

Ceviche: Very cute presentation in a martini glass, accompanied by some fried tortilla chips.  Though the presentation was cute, I'd personally rather have the chips on the side since it just gets soggy, unless of course, you eat it right away.  I've also had my share of fresh ceviche, mainly in Costa Rica, but their ingredients were still quite fresh.  I wish they did have more shrimp and scallops in it though, rather than the other garnishes. 4.5\/5

Chicken Nachos: Had just a few bites but it thoroughly enjoyed it.  The chips were nicely cooked and didn't get soggy and kept their crunch.  Jalapeños were very fresh, versus the usual pickled ones.  Serving was also quite generous so it's a perfect appetizer or for a pekish group. 5\/5

Pescado (Fish Tacos): Because they have a pretty large tacos menu, I asked the waitress what they recommend and she recommended the Pescado which was a nice, meaty white fish.  It was nicely battered and not greasy at all.  I'm quite picky with my fish tacos but this I'd definitely order again. 5\/5

Longosta (Lobster Tacos): Whenever there's lobster on the menu, it's a must try.  I'm glad that my friend feels the same way as we happily shared a platter.  We received a pretty good portion of lobster and it also tasted pretty fresh.  Definitely worth trying. 5\/5.",1.0
"The location of this branch is very convenient. The selection of donuts was lacking though. They had pictures of the cheesecake square donuts but had none in stock. The person behind the counter was nice and welcoming. However, they didn't know how to pack the long john donuts and had no problems selling stale donuts.",1.0
"Delicious! The food is amazing and prompt! All the servers do a great job helping each other out and are so polite! Multiple servers were helping us with our order, food, refills, and extra sauces. Out check came out quickly! Did I mention the food was amazing? I tried the Blanco Burger and LOVED it! The guac on the burger was fresh and they gave me extra since I opted out for the cheese. I also strongly recommend the truffle fries! Try this place out sometime! #Enjoy",1.0
"I wouldn't even give this place one star, it should be a -5star.  Managers need to go back to customer service training. I tried to do a move out walk through but the apartment had been broke into so I had to go to the office and deal with Alex, He is the most rudest, unprofessional Manager I have ever encountered.  My advise to you Sir, If you don't want to deal with the public quit your job and find something else.  You looked at me and treated me like I was trailer trash, for your information Alex I am not trailer trash, I live in a nicer place than you manage and I most likely make twice the money you do.  All I was trying to do was give you back your  apartment.  With your paint that cant be washed and carpet that cant be cleaned.   You need a attitude adjustment.",1.0
"I really enjoyed shopping here. I would say that this is a dress store. You go here when you're looking for a dress for a special event - graduation, wedding, special party, something like that. Everything is well organized and quite beautiful. I like the colour-coding method. The dressing rooms are very pretty and have good lighting. I like the sale section in the basement and I found the sales people to be very helpful. I like this area of St. Laurent for clothes shopping as there are several boutiques right near each other. And this is the best one for dresses.",1.0
"We ate here for dinner with the family because we had a gift card. We went on a Friday evening at 6pm. We were told it would be a 35 minute wait but was seated within 10 minutes. At the front they have an open basket of Andes chocolate--my favorite! You start out with warm delicious bread and butter. It tasted so good. My husband ordered the jalapeño smash burger with a side of homemade potato chips and also the shareable side of lobster Mac and cheese. I ordered the centennial special. It was a sirloin steak with a side of white cheddar mash potatoes. It comes with a salad which was dressed with ranch and your choice of a creme Brulee or cheesecake dessert. 

I loved how they have paper as a tablecloth and crayons to draw\/color. It kept my kids entertained. Everything tasted good and was cooked well. The service was good. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. This restaurant met my expectations and I plan to return again",1.0
"NishikaWa has a very decent bowl of ramen. I had a spicy miso which is really good. I've had better Southern California but not bad for a valley option.

The service was prompt and ambience was great when it was early dinner time. I am sure I'll come back here every once and while when I need to fix a ramen craving. Very nice place!",1.0
"4.5 stars. Came here on a Wednesday afternoon for a coffee break. The shop was pretty empty. I ordered a latte and it was made really quickly and beautifully with some latte art on top. $4 for a latte, price is pretty standard. The latte was perfect. Stronger on the espresso side, perfect temperature, milk steamed to a foamy (but not too foamy) perfection! 5 stars for this latte. It was really, really excellent. Decor is nice, kind of Nordic inspired. My only complaint is that they don't take credit cards.",1.0
"As we on our way to the Toronto, Ontario airport, hubby found this place on Yelp. After a lot of time searching for a good Asian dinner, hubby found this little charming neighborhood restaurant nearby and based on the chef's culinary background, we knew this would be a solid restaurant.

Since this is an Asian fusion tapas place, we ordered a few.
- Grilled tiger shrimp mango salad with Thai basil, chopped fresh tomato, thinly sliced lettuce with chili dressing (very good and light, sweet, salty and tangy at each bite)
- Grilled Argentina style steak (was my least favorite, nothing to wow and was the most expensive dish, but hubby liked it).  It's served with chimichurri butter and hand cut fries. 
- Grilled spicy jerk seasoning with grilled tilapia fish with mango salsa (another light dish and substituted the fries for rice, (really like this dish, light)
- Grilled steak tacos with salsa, fresh cheese and avocado for my little guy (but there was no avocado).  The lemongrass pork with rice and Asian slaw (tastier than the steak).
- Tres leeches cake (I wanted to see how this compares between their version vs. the Mexican Tres Leche which I am familiar with) was a very wet and sweet cake.  The winner is the chef. The chef was classically trained by a Japanese chef so I think this is why his desserts aren't as sweet (which I prefer).  It's more like a light sponge cake topped with whipped cream and fresh sliced strawberries and filled with light condensed milk at the bottom of the cake. The chef's wife saw me took a picture and she told me if she knew ahead of time, she would garnished with flower to make it prettier, very cute of her.

Prices range from $8-10 for small tapas. The large tapas range between $12-$21. We picked the most two expensive dishes on the menu.  Highly recommended this place to anyone.  Sort of on the way to the Toronto airport, they have parking lot in the back.  I would recommend reservations, since this is a small neighborhood restaurant and does get crowded mostly from their regulars.

I wish I could live close by this restaurant so I can be one of their regulars too.",1.0
I don't think the food or restaurant cleanliness is very good.  I don't know why people like this restaurant.,1.0
"I haven't had poke before so I was open minded to the experience. Firstly, I felt it was expensive for what I actually got. It is $10.95 for regular and $12.95 for large. The regular size is what I would consider an appetizer size and definitely nowhere close to a meal so don't think you will be satisfied after eating this. Get a large if you're going here, perhaps this portion will be better. Keeping in mind where they opened- Korea town\/Annex neighbourhood, all of the restaurants offer great value so I felt this to be a little out of place.

I 'built my own' poke, you get a choice of white or brown rice, choice of fish, choice of sauce, 6 toppings. I got white rice, half ahi tuna half salmon, salsa verde sauce; my toppings were cucumber, edamame, tobiko, green onion, taro chips and lotus chips. Secondly, I asked for the chips on the side- ie. separate from the meal in like a bag or foil because this is my preference but they just stuck them on one side of the bowl (which is what they do anyway). I watched them make the poke before I ordered so this wasn't a trick question.

There was a LOT of rice and only a few pieces of fish so it was out of proportion. I would have liked a more salsa verde, the flavour was good but not enough. I ended up throwing out 1\/3 of the leftover rice. 

Decor was nice, clean and simple with wood counters and bar stools. The food prep area was set up like an assembly such as Chipotle. So whether I had an authentic poke or not, I wouldn't know. However, I know that I did not enjoy it and felt ripped off for what I got.",1.0
"We decided to try to place because the place next door was closed. Opted for the special that was posted on the door, it's a kebob and rice for $6.25 or something like that. It took about 15 mins to make the meal. It didn't taste like anything special, in fact, it didn't have much of any taste at all. We didn't enjoy this meal, it was bland and there are other restaurants that make a better kebob nearby that we would rather eat at.",1.0
"My favorite study spot aside from the library. It tends to get busy here at night, when students come out to study. I make sure to call before heading there to make sure there is a table available. It can get a bit noisy with all the customers it gets, so if noise is an issue for you, this isn't the place. I like that they don't blast their music and what's playing is more relaxing than upbeat.
Drinks do take a while to come out, especially when it's packed, so be patient. Lattes and frappes ive gotten seem to be on the sweeter side, so be sure to ask them to make it less sweet if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. They are quite accommodating to your drink and give you recommendations when you can't decide. Baristas are all very sweet. 
Swap out milk with soy for $0.50. 
My favorite drink is the CREAM green tea frappe, which includes matcha and macadamia and is quite filling. The Y.D.D (yabba dabba doo) is popular, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you enjoy drinking your fruity pebbles.",1.0

"If you are expecting a pizza place to understand how to do pizza delivery, do not order from Streets of New York.  When I placed orders via the website, often the information about toppings would get lost in translation.  We have had orders arrive well over an hour past the expected delivery time.  Finally, we recently had a pizza order that never arrived, and when we called for status we were repeatedly told ""the driver is on his way"" even though they are only located a couple of blocks down the street.  This was the final straw which caused my wife and I to vow to never order from Streets of New York again.",1.0
I love this store!! Literally the best customer experience I have ever had in my life!!! And I'm not just saying that!! Very knowledgeable!! Explained everything to me! Never tried to sell me something extra or rip me off! Fixed my pool vacuum within 10 minutes.. I had other interests and questions with pool equipment and left there feeling like an expert with pools lol. Such a relief to find a place with great employees!! Great job!!!!,1.0
"As always, a consistently good meal. Their BBQ sauce is a major draw and I had a healthy option lunch but had them do my chicken in the sauce. 

They accommodate and service is above average. We ate outside and the patio is tight which is a drawback. The other drawback is that the AC units are just plain loud. 

The noise didn't necessarily ruin the experience, but you would think they would find a way to buffer. Other than that, it's a good place worth a visit if your in the falls.",1.0
Horrible! Not only did they not cut my dogs hair evenly or even nice at all. The customer service was fake and down right rude. I will not take my dog there again! There are too many groomers around for all that drama. I loved the locale and thought it would be a great place but totally wasn't. I wish Yelp had negative stars.,1.0
It was my last day in Edinburgh and I decided to eat as much as I can around the city.  I had the piglet size sandwich with the sage and onion and my friend got the apple sauce with the pork. The meat is juicy and my most favorite was the piece of crisps pork skin on top. Delicious! I will be back next time I visit.,1.0
"WOW! I'll preface my review by stating that I am not a spa person - not because I don't like spas, but because I have found them in the past to be an unnecessary luxury. After 1 visit to Pure + Simple though, I'm HOOKED.

I'm a person with generally very good skin - I don't have major breakouts, and the worst my face will get is a zit or two MAYBE once a month. A 3 week trip to Iceland + Italy changed my skin for the worst! In the last 4 days of trip, my face BROKE OUT, like never before. I had breakouts on my forehead, between my brows, my cheeks, my chin, my upper lip, LITERALLY EVERY WHERE. Needless to say, I was quite traumatized!! On my way home, I desperately googled Spas + Facials, and I really stumbled upon Pure + Simple. I decided to give them a try because of their philosophy of natural products + their unbeatable price point for their basic facial. 

Once I landed at Pearson - I was on the call with Pure + Simple and luckily they had an opening that same day!

When I arrived, I was given a short questionnaire to fill out and was introduced to my esthetician, Shadi. Shadi was incredibly sweet, understanding, and sympathetic to my trauma. She was reassuring throughout the entire facial and made me feel a lot better about my situation. I will 100% book with her again. 

The treatment itself was unlike anything I've ever had! Now granted, I've only had 1 other facial (8 years ago!), but still, I could tell that pure + simple were the REAL FACIAL GURUS. They had a really cool steam machine that Shadi moved over my face, and the steam gentle opened up my pores while she massaged my face with essential oils - and whatever else magical ingredients she had. I felt at once relaxed. The extractions - while never pleasant, were as painless as possible. 

Once the facial was done - I looked in the mirror and my face was GLOWING! Of course, I still had the bumps + acne on my face, but she managed to pop the most prominent ones and reduce the appearance of the acne greatly on my cheeks and my chin. She also offered me some great samples that I LOVE, and even went back a few days later to purchase. (black mud cream + aloe face wash). I ended up picking up some more things as well.

I've already recommended this spa to several friends and I am REALLY looking forward to my next booking!",1.0

After years of foodie friends and yelpers telling me to get there I finally was able to make it happen, and the wait wasn't in vain; wow... sooo goood.

Meal: Crispy Rice, Coconut Mushroom Chicken Soup, Lamb w\/ Peppercorn, Ginger Sea Bass, Crispy Duck, Garlic Prawns.
I'm not going to pretend to be good at describing these in detail but my top two are crispy rice and the coconut mushroom soup. Just unreal. I WILL be back next time I'm in Vegas. Just wow.",1.0

"My mom and I had been looking on Yelp for a nice nail salon in the area to visit. I came across 24 Nail and saw that they had glowing reviews. I called them to ask how much a pedicure costs. I spoke with a man who misinterpreted my question; and then told me that, yes, they do use disposable pedicure liners in their tubs. Ok, cool...definitely good to know, but not what I asked. I asked him again about the price and this time he let me know it was $22 for a regular pedicure and $40 for a gel pedicure. 

This was great news, because I had called some other 5-star Yelp places and 24 Nail had their prices beat by $6-$10!!! The man never told me to make an appointment and I didn't ask if I needed one because they indicate that you don't need appointments on their Yelp page--they don't have a website, or at least I couldn't find it by Googling their name. 

Well, when my mom and I walked in there and asked for pedicures we were rejected!!! 

There were three workers, one female doing a client's nails and two males doing two other client's pedicures. There was no one else visible in the nail salon. They asked us what we wanted, we replied with ""pedicures."" The female looked at the other two workers, then back at us and said, ""We don't really have time, sorry."" 

Ok. We were obviously confused, because we were definitely willing to wait and there wasn't anyone already waiting. I thought that maybe they were getting ready to close since it was around 3:30pm on a Sunday, and they wouldn't have time to do two more pedicures before they had to close. That wasn't the case, however, since their hours are 9:30am-11pm on Sundays!!! 

Plus, why would you even ask what we wanted if you were going to reject us anyway? It's not like there's a nail service that doesn't take at least 20+ minutes. Maybe put a sign on the door? Maybe let people know when they call that you are busy that day and suggest an appointment? Maybe ask if we'd be willing to wait or even come back a little later? The way she said it was so condescending and that left us with a negative feeling. We've never been turned down any where before so it was shocking. 

I wrote a Yelp review about this place as soon as the incident happened and the next day (today) Yelp sent me an email stating that they removed my review, because ""We understand you may have had an interaction with this business, however your review appears to be based on the business policies rather than a customer experience."" I'm not really sure why they would say my review was based on business policies and not customer service. It absolutely was a customer service issue. Sure, you can say it wasn't, but only on the basis that we never actually had the chance to become customers!!! 

So, no, I cannot attest to the fact that they do nice nails since they didn't want to do ours. We can see from other Yelpers that they do a good job. I just wanted to inform others to not be surprised if they reject you, and to hopefully leave a tip for 24 Nail to learn better customer communication skills.",1.0
I know a bunch of people are thinking that it's just ice cream rolled but i personally like that the cream doesn't taste too creamy or just milk and the toppings. The workers are so nice to let you know what's popular and what kinda of toppings you could mix into the cream. It's pretty good!!!!  I mixed coffee and Cocoa pebbles.,1.0
Gosh I wish this place was in my home town!The best Manicure I've ever had!Ben made sure my nails were perfect and took his time.I never felt rushed.I can't stop looking at my nails!I wish they would stay forever!Who would have thought you could have such a great experience at a nail salon off the grid in Vegas!,1.0
"I was glad that my old friend from way back had our time to reconnect here.
The place had a very laid back bar setting with outdoor seating at the far back and a giant window patio seating at the front.

We went at 4 PM on a Thursday right as they opened and pretty much had the place to ourselves. The service was average nothing to complain or praise about but the staff was nice and friendly.

We both ordered the Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle meal served with a scotch-bonet-corriander-lime syrup and gravy that also came with a small serving of garden salad. We also ordered the Mac-N-Cheese as a side.

The Southern Fried Chicken & Waffle meal was excellent. The two pieces of chicken was juicy and tender and perfectly crispy. It could have maybe been a little more flavourful in my opinion but was still really good!
The waffles on the other hand was all-round perfect. Soft, light and spongy with a bit of chew to it so it's not like you're just eating air. 
The two sauces that came with the meal was excellent, I actually used them both, they complement the flavour of the meal altogether. The salad was just your basic garden salad.

The Mac-N-Cheese side was tasty! The cheese to macaroni ratio was 2:1 meaning that it was perfectly cheesy and creamy having a nice baked crust of cheese on the top. Definitely would have ordered an extra. I regret not doing it. 

Overall the experience was really good. Had lots of laughs with good company and food. Would for sure go back.",1.0
"Super super overpriced! It was $18.88 for a normal sized bowl of noodles. We got 3 small dishes from the cart and a bowl of noodles, which came to $60! For Vegas, it's fine. But dim sum should never be that expensive.",1.0
"I ordered the Salmon Pita but changed my mind while watching some other customers order go by.  The Combo Meat ($13.99) gives you a choice of two meats.  The gentlemen recommended the Chicken Kabob and said they would do the salmon for me and spoke to the lady who's cooking to let her know.  The Dinner Plate comes with rice and salad.

Overall the food was good.
The gentleman was tops with service and recommendations too.
I came here based on reviews, and it's a bit out of my way, so overall I think we've got Greek and Mediterranean options that are much closer and equivalent in taste and value.",1.0

Je n'aime pas trop les entraînements sur machine mais j'avoue qu'à ce gym même ça c'est agréable! Il n'y a jamais d'attente pour utiliser une machine (vélo, tapis, elliptique, etc) et elles sont toujours propres. Les cours sont aussi très intéressants et offerts par des entraîneurs certifiés.

De plus, il y'a un sauna dans le vestiaire qui est accessible en tout temps.J'ajoute que le fait que le centre soit collé à la station de métro Pie-IX est aussi un plus.",1.0
"3 Stars, the place was busy on a saturday afternoon, but I don't see it much better if it was tuesday at opening either.
The food is simple, the presentation is zero. It's not bad sushi and it's not great either. Yes, the server was not smiling, but I don't care if he does or not.
If you want to see a smiling clown, go to the circus. He was prompt in seating us, we waited just a few minutes, took our drink order and then on with the sushi in the All you can eat mode.
The first order of various rolls were good and as I said before it's just little round plastic like plates and no presentation points, not too overly sauced and was ok. We didn't get the small soy sauce dishes, but just put the sauce in the larger plate that had the wasabi and ginger on it. The sign on the wall said ""Fresh Wasabi"" $1, but the wasabi that came with the sushi was fresh as can be and had the punch to the nose zip! We started out with one server and then another one started to serve us, which was kind of odd, but it worked. The two guys are busy and if they hired just a single table busser they could take care of business much better. It's not a good thing when suddenly a plate drops down like a stone from heaven and you don't know what the item is, they are too busy to tell you. We actually had one roll fall on our table that we didn't know it was for someone else until we ate it. I'm like, ""We didn't order this"", but it was good so thanks to whoever didn't get it. LOL! I also order a few nigiri sushi (the small bites) and it took a while for it to arrive, I could see it was ready up at the sushi bar, but it sat for a few minutes. Then when it came the rice was noticeably warm which meant they didn't make enough during prep time because it should be cool to compliment the fish. 
The restaurant is tiny inside, but somehow they manage to seat everyone the best they can. Random signs on the walls with specials such as $1 sake and different beers. I had a Sapporo light and it was good, I guess they don't offer the giant godzilla size bottle like most places, but that is ok by me. I am in Summerlin and have a long drive back to Henderson so, no buzz is a good thing. My second drink was Asahi Zero which is a low carb and no alcohol ""beer"", it was cold and good with enough bubbles to satisfy like a coke, but with no sugar overload. The also offer a Mango soda in a bottle and it was good too.
The restaurant is located in or near Summerlin, but I will have to admit there was some skectchy looking people in that parking lot, but that is no fault of the restaurant. Probably just a product of their environment with a thrift store on one side and big lots on the other? Just saying.

"I get the feeling that the staff values young adult guests less. I've brought friends here and though we are terribly polite we seem to bother the staff by just being there. However, many young people are servers too, know what good service is and will tip accordingly. My best girl friend and I come in every once and blue moon for brunch and without fail, the staff blows us off. We are never checked on, get one word replies, and we dare not alter our meals even slightly or we'll get dirty looks. Refills weren't offered.

"Decided to hit the new place in town! First thing I noticed when I walked in was the very cool atmosphere. However they joint was close to empty for a Friday night at 7pm... It was very nice lighting and good music as well as having the Hawks game on. They had some good deals like $5 flatbread and $5 cocktails. We started with the Korean BBQ wings which were almost sour, they needed a tad more sweetness. They also labeled the wings as 'jumbo'. They were not jumbo. 
I also had the BBQ chicken flatbread which was very good. They seemed to skimp out on the chicken a bit but otherwise it was delicious. My boyfriend had the burger with Mac and cheese on it, he said it was good but a little small. The fries were fantastic, they tasted just like McDonald's fries. YUM. I also had the 'illini' mojito which was pretty good, I think it could have used a touch more mint.

The mushroom pasta is a MUST TRY!

Brought my Tundra in for the airbag recall. They were able to schedule it for the coming Saturday, which was great. Dropped off early, got the call it was done by 10:30. Pretty quick.

What I didn't know is that they were going to root around my truck and try to find things wrong with it so they could attempt to extort me. I REALLY don't like people dicking around with my vehicle, and this was never mentioned to me when I authorized an airbag inflator warranty remedy only.

Their ~$700 estimate was comical and insulting. $30 to change a $1.50 light bulb in the bed light? Wow. $340 to install a new $20 thermostat because the housing was leaking (I was thorough with the Hondabond when I did the t-belt\/water pump in 2013; turned out to be some spilled coolant from when I replaced my busted radiator last summer, wiped away easily)? Holy shit! $100 to change $15 worth of brake fluid because they claimed it was dirty (changed it with Pentosin March 2015)? The service advisor also mentioned something about the alignment being off. Considering I just had it done to my specification (lots of caster, higher than factory recommendation) 2 months prior, and it drives better than ever, I doubt that. 

Funny thing is, they must not care about any ""issues"" under the vehicle, since there was no mention of the leak in my transfer case 4WD actuator that I know about and am too lazy to fix. Curious...

But the most egregious item on the estimate was the airbag light diagnosis. My airbag light went on a few days after I stopped in to make my appointment (of course). Figure they were changing the inflator, that could correct the issue.. It didn't (of course) but they wanted $98 to tell me what the light meant. Now keep in mind that any tech doing warranty work on the airbag system would undoubtedly connect the vehicle to the Toyota TechStream software to ensure the repair had been done correctly, especially if a light is already on. It would be unthinkable for them to just remove and replace the inflator, then hope for the best.

So, they certainly knew what the error to cause the light to stay on was, but would not share it unless I let them bend me over for $100. Better idea; but the TechStream cable and software, install on my laptop, and diagnose myself for $60. Also means I can turn off the TPMS light in my Camry. Win win!!!

Be educated, or your wallet will be raped! Not cool to go so far out of there way to find things ""wrong"" with my truck when I authorized them to do nothing more than what it said in the letter I received from Toyota. Already done with their parts department, and now I hope to never have to revisit this dealership again for any reason.",1.0

"My wife and I have been going to Romano's for many years as they were the closest thing to NYC pizza we could find here in NC. However, they have changed owners several times and each time the quality of the food has gone down. 
The last two times we ate there we were disappointed. Tonight, we decided to give it one last try. We ordered our usual, an extra large pie with mushrooms and onions. OMG... it was horrendous!!! I ate one slice from the pie as did my wife. We left the rest on the table and we will NEVER go back.
So... what was so bad? The crust was... bready. The sauce was bland. The cheese. Well... I'm not sure what kind of cheese it was.
I tried adding Parmesan cheese and that helped a little, but there was no getting away from the bread-like crust. If you know NYC pizza, then you know that the crust is as important as the sauce and that is as important as the cheese.
I did notice a lack of any spices in the sauce or sprinkled on top. Overall, the Pizza was awful.
We used to love Romano's. We would go every Friday night and it was packed. Considering tonight is Friday night, there was only one other table with  a family sitting at it. I guess others figured out what my wife and I finally came to realize.

"This is an incredible whiskey bar. They allegedly have good food... but that's not why I come.

If you're seeking allocated whiskeys, chances are The Free House Pub has a few. The selection of whiskeys changes as new ones come in and old ones go out. When you step up to the bar, be sure to ask for a whiskey menu. There are things that your eyes won't find. At the same time, look around. Sometimes there are things available that haven't hit the whiskey menu yet.

When you're looking at the menu, check out the prices. You won't find any Miami, Chicago, New York or Las Vegas pricing here. You'll get excellent pours at very affordable prices.

If you're into Angel's Envy, they even have their own private bottling of it.

Finally, the staff is very friendly. I know my whiskey. Sometimes the bartenders do, too. Regardless, I've never run into anyone there who wasn't a pleasure to deal with and won't take a few moments to chat with you, especially during slower times.

My friends and I were planning a surprise birthday party for another friend, and having worked in the restaurant industry for many years, I absolutely understand the difficulty of acquiring a reservation for 12 people on a Saturday evening at 6:30 (prime time!). I had attempted to book a reservation for 6:30pm at Union Social Eatery, but was given the option of 5pm only. I took the spot, as 5pm could have been do-able for the party. A few days later, there was a hitch in the plans, and the reservation needed to be pushed back. I called in asking if there was any way I could push back the reservation to 6 or 6:30pm. The girl who answered the phone put me on hold and all of a sudden a very abrasive gentleman was speaking to me in a very defensive tone. I was confused at first, number one I had never been yelling at the girl, nor had I been irritated, and number two, I didn't understand why I was speaking to someone different now, but, nonetheless, I asked him the other questions I had, which were:
1. Do you take reservations at a later time on Saturdays and did I just try to book too late? (I wanted to know for future reference...however this is now a moot point). 
2. What if I decided to cancel the reservation and then became a walk-in party? Would that be an option? 

The man on the phone had a very aggressive tone and was very rude to me. He stated over and over again that he would turn me away if I tried to walk in and he ""just wouldn't even take"" my party. Again I asked my question about the reservations (do they take them at a later time or stop taking them at a certain time to allow for walk-ins, every restaurant is different and I have worked at both types), but he ignored the question completely and repeated himself stating a later time wasn't a possibility. Again, having worked int he restaurant industry in varying capacities for a long period of time, and working in customer service for even longer, I know a thing or two about operations and how to speak to and treat people who are asking reasonable questions. Still, I said okay and thanked him, and the call ended by him stating ""well, maybe we can see you next time then"" and he hung up. I was confused because nowhere in the conversation had I ever stated I was cancelling my initial 5pm reservation. I just had an inquiry about having a later time and 2 follow up questions. I then received an e-mail stating my reservation had been cancelled. 

I was too irritated to call back, so my friend who was with me at the time called back. He was just as rude and abrasive to her, and when she stated that he was being rude, he said that he was not being rude and that she was being rude. He also said that I had been just as rude and said that I wanted to cancel the reservation. She said that she was with me when I called and that I wasn't rude and  I did not say that I wanted to cancel. He proceeded to call her a liar by saying sarcastically ""sure you were"". I am absolutely appalled that anyone would ever speak to someone in this way, let alone representatives of a party of 10 others who would surely (and definitely did) hear about this. That is so much business that you are losing and an awful reputation to gain. I told all of my friends and family about this and vowed to never step into a Union Social Eatery, and they all stated they would do the same and told their friends and family. 

Union Social Eatery, I had heard a TON of positive feedback about you, and you had been on a list of places that I wanted to try for awhile, but as the quote by the great Maya Angelou goes, ""I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel."", and this is most certainly true for me.

We shared the Delano breakfast ($19): two eggs any style (over medium), choice of meat, toast, fruit cup or potatoes. The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the whole wheat toast was really delicious (it was a slice off an artisan loaf, I'm guessing. It had a really nice crunchy crust). Whipped butter and jam served on the side. The waiter neglected to ask what kind of sausage we wanted, so instead of the house made chicken apple, we got pork. It had good flavor, but was more on the fatty side for sausage. The fruit cup was a uneventful mix of unripe cantaloupe, honeydew, and some puny pieces of pineapple. Oh, and there was one small piece of broccolini. I'm all about veggies for breakfast so it would've been nice to have 2-3 pieces. 

The real disappointment was the doughssants, or whatever they're calling them there. I'm just going to say Cronuts. They were pretty dry and tasteless. One entire donut was basically hollow.

"This is our go-to breakfast joint in Verdun! The price to quality ratio just can't be beat! I've also had several other menu items, and definitely recommend the pizza, the rex special sub (extraordinary tzaziki!), and the burgers and onion rings. Their greek salad is also excellent!

Overall, the restaurant was beautifully lit, awesome live jazz music, and the owners are super sweet. 10\/10 great experience!",1.0
"Atmosphere , dj tossing down tunes between plays of game are the only reason I have this place 2 stars . the wife and I sat at a table for 15 minute and the waitress passed us up Multiple times. 2 dudes came in sat down. Within 1 minute she was serving them. We ended up going to the main bar for next 2 rounds. Definitely won't be back and won't recommend. I despise places that provide selective service",1.0
"I went for Breakfast and can say the food was absolutely terrible. I ordered the country fried steak with over easy eggs, biscuits and gravy with grits. The fried steak was awful and tasted metallic same as the gravy. I would not be surprised if the gravy came from a can. The eggs were cooked properly but not seasoned. The grits were bland and not seasoned as well. The service did not make up at all for the lack of the food quality. Our server did not smile and took our order incorrectly, twice. Never apologized for making a mistake just saying ""oh"" when it was brought to her attention.

"We drove all the way from downtown Charlotte to eat at this place because of good reviews this was our first time here. We asked to be sat in the bar area where there was one other couple due to the main restaurant was busy & full. The hostess was very rude and inattentive meanwhile walking through the restaurant sipping on a Chick Fil A drink. 

After the hostess sat us we were unaware of who would be serving us as the hostess laid the menus down and walked off. The bartender is who was suppose to be serving us as we say there for 15 minutes without someone coming to the table with water or to tell us it would be a few minutes before someone would be able to wait on us. During that wait I got up twice to ask the hostess if there would be someone waiting on us that is when she went over and told the bartender and he told her he made hand gestures as if he didn't want to wait on us. So then proceeded to walk through again without coming and informing us that it would be an even longer wait. 

Finally after all that I walked back up to the hostess station to ask her could we just move to the main area where people were being served properly and waited on she was reluctant to answer and as we stood there in silence I asked ""are we suppose to seat ourselves?"" She said ""YEA"" !!!
I then asked could I speak to a manager and she laughed and rudely stated ""oh, he's out of town"" and there will not be a manager to assist us.

"Neg stars. Don't go 2 sch here! Wanted 1\/2"" roots-only lighter color & left w\/ 3ft yellow hair! I Q AIPs following industry Best Practices & Aveda standards. I would've never trusted a student, but I sure trusted the wrong EDUCATOR. Their Aveda Certified Educator, Color Specialist, 2014 Inspire Greatness Aveda Institute Champion combo cosmetology TEAM LEAD (TL) did not follow verbal or written instructions that I provided her & student (S). Plus, she formulated unorthodox chemicals for someone w\/ my coloring. Even AVEDA CORP said she should've known better.

Adjust contrast\/brightness of your monitor N order 2 C the true colors of my pix. As per AIP, the .pdf\/evidence of my instructions keeps being deleted from YELP.

I said 2x to ea & wrote once ""Apply color to new growth only."" They put color 4.5"" past my 1\/2"" of new growth. I said I wanted 2 go 1- 2 shades lighter than my standard Aveda formula I have used for 6 years: 30 vol 60g of Deep 10N @ 45 mins. The written instructions also said, ""Do not use foils, pull through, or use a gloss."" This formula & method provided me with an earthy honey blond. B\/c I wore my hair in the same braid @ all my outdoorsy jobs, my hair looked like multi-toned whipped honey peppered w\/ sparkly platinum streaks.

TL formulated: 40 vol 60g of Deep 12N @ 45 min w\/ shower cap.

My crown turned POLAR BEAR WHITE (PBW). In response, TL, who teaches blonding classes, said, ""I didn't expect this to be so light. Sometimes this happens. Blondes are hard."" Then TL said she'd fix it.

TL formulated: 40g 0N + 40g 10N + 1g  Lite Yellow Orange + 40mL of CTA.

Unfortunately, TL & S coated all my hair--not just the white part. TL tried 2 dilute the mistake-not fix it. This wasn't prudent. FINAL RESULT: my crown was monochromatic yet streaky ELECTRIC BUTTER YELLOW & the rest of my normally glossy multi-d sun-kissed honey blond hair was DULL, DRY shades of homogeneous STRAW YELLOW w\/ PUMPKIN ORANGE tones. My entire head was a color mullet in shades of Crayola Crayons. And this was the ""fixed"" version?

When I got really upset, an older blond mgr told me to come back in 2-3 days after my hair calmed down for a FREE color correction. At 1st, I accepted. I had been there for 5 hours & was exhausted, hungry, & so very much wanted it to be fixable. But, after all my research, I realized how egregious the mistakes were & wasn't going to subject myself to a 2nd multi-mistake incident.  There was no way my hair or I could handle a 3rd trauma. She's THE BEST of THE BEST--and this is what happened??? I stopped my cc payment the following week, &  AIP did not contest it.

I learned, much later, from Aveda Educators around the country, Color Specialists in the valley, & Aveda Corp, 40 vol is used on people with black\/choco, coarse, & thick hair who want 2 go platinum or Crayola-colored. (I have naturally dark-blond, fine hair; fair, yellow-toned skin; and dark green eyes. How could she not notice this?) She used one of the lightest possible Lift-Color-Methods: 40vol\/Deep 12N\/Shower cap.

1-2 shades lighter is literally changing only Deep 10N to Deep 11N or 12N--not changing the volume, especially together with color, and most especially w\/n the Deep line. Deep already has extra vol\/lift contained in it. Adding a shower cap on top of all the extra changes is baffling. A Color Specialist noted that 1-2 shades lighter could be achieved by just adding foils 2 the original formula I've used for yrs or rinsing out @ 30 mins instead of 45 mins. Also, CTA= gloss, & professionals never tone 3ft-long blond hair.

The TL should have never bumped me up to 40 vol, especially w\/shower cap. This is significant b\/c I asked her, as we looked at my written formula & instructions, if she could only change 1 number, which would it be, & she responded that she wouldn't; she'd change BOTH!!!! I also discovered that TL was NOT S's official Educator. (I'm not sure if TL took over my hair b\/c she wanted to experiment w\/ it, but it's hard NOT to consider this her true motive.)

The formula TL used on my already-blond hair caused 5 levels of lift (not 1-2 shades), which explains the PBW. She stripped my crown of all color by highlighting my whole head, & even bleached my scalp. It flaked & itched. If she didn't expect my hair to turn white, then, tell me, WHAT COLOR DID SHE EXPECT IT TO TURN?

Their TL does not truly understand blonding or Deep. This will take me 6 years to grow out permanently altered & damaged hair and about $1K to patch up. This color service set me back K's 4 time, gas, both corrective & blue\/purpl products; & they're not paying me back. Now, I have hi maintenance hair & may have 2 cut short it in the future d\/t drynessI can't speak for other Educators at this institute, but I can speak for the TL, & seriously question AIPs adherence to industry Best Practices, Aveda superior standards, & basic ethics. AIP is sneaky, dishonest, & not BBB accredited

Isles and isles of vitamins and supplements out the hoo-ha...who needs that much crap?!?!? 

Anyway.
Husband and I traveled to this part of town to come to NG the first week it opened. Since we had never been in this area we were excited to see what was up.
I myself having been to several NG in other states I was SUPER pumped and was explaining to my husband how the one in Dallas is set up.

We walk inside and he grumbles lol.

We specifically wanted to grab some vegan snacks and granola type mixes for his work trip to LA the next day...wow... Their own branded granola when the package was turned over looked like dust. Straight up crumbs. 

And!!!!! Allllll the chocolate featured items such as pretzels, trail mixes, blah blah of their own brand in the refrigerator section all have milk in them. Milk.

Anyway we decided on Purely Elizabeth granola and another cranberry orange mix from another company. I really would have liked to support NG but the crumbs, milk and not being organic issues are a complete turn off.

I do love that they carry organic pet foods and treats etc but the $2-5+ hike in price compared to Amazon is just really terrible. 

Their produce although all organic? was nothing to be excited about. It's a small, cramped and cluttered tiny area. It was busy and like eight people practically elbowing each other to get veggies is not my cup of tea.

Oh and all the checkout counters had employees standing around chatting. No clue of who was open or closed. No eye contact.

I'll stick with Whole Foods.

PS: If you do go here.......don't forget your own bags!!!!!!! I never forget my own bags but we were rudely reminded that if we did, we would have to buy their reusable bags at a fee, they supply zero paper bags.

"If I could give 6 stars I would. What an absolutely WONDERFUL experience!

My girlfriend and I have always agreed experiences are worth far more than possessions. For my birthday, she signed me up for a 3-hour session at the Whiskey School here put on by George, the owner and founder of Las Vegas Distillery and the man who made America's first Desert Whiskey.

George taught us everything from the history of the drink, to how it's made, grain to bottle, to how to use his million dollar contraption pictured behind us - not to mention each intricacy of the science in between. We were involved the whole time and it was more-so a conversation, not a lecture, which makes for a strong learning experience.

In the middle of the session, he even bought us lunch! Another one of the employees there (I think Sid? Missed his name) joined us as we sat down at the picnic tables inside. Two pizzas were ordered and we shared a six-pack as we took a break from the whiskey talk and got to know each other more personally.

We finished the day with a blind tasting where my newly gained knowledge resulted in one of 20 or so perfect scores George has ever seen. My girlfriend and I left with smiles ear to ear, two new bottles from George's first barrels, a new best friend and one unforgettable memory. What an incredible man and day well spent.

It's worth mentioning that we were the only people there that day for Whiskey School, so others may have different experiences based on class size, but we were utterly wowed by how great of a day we had. We cannot wait until the next time we are in Vegas so we can stop by the distillery and catch up with George.

Did you know, the whiskey that naturally evaporates from the barrel during the aging process is called Angel's Share? In Scotland and Kentucky, 2% of the barrel is consumed by the angels each year. In Las Vegas' dry climate, George copes with upwards of 11% loss each year. In turn, no whiskey can be aged in Las Vegas 10 years or you'd simply have nothing left. That 50 year old whiskey your friend gave you from Scotland? Unless it's air, your friend was lying. These are some of the few facts you'll learn and retain throughout the day.

Lastly, it stuck with us how George mentioned coming to America with his wife from Romania was life-changing and becoming an American citizen is the highest honor. Couldn't help but be happy hearing that! One of the other reviews on here mentioned when there are awesome people doing an awesome thing and you want them to be successful. That's exactly how I feel as well.

"Location: Ville Saint-Laurent (at Place Vertu). Ample parking. In all honesty, there aren't too many options to grab a drink after work in this area, unless you want to hit up the West Island. 

The place: The interior is quite spacious, with a big bar and lots of wood accents. There are plenty of windows too, so the space is pretty bright. There's also a terrace of a decent size. 

The goods: I ordered the Sicilian sangria and my friend ordered the peach Bellini. I'm not going to lie - the drinks sucked. First of all, hers didn't look anything like a Bellini. It looked like white wine in a martini glass. She said it was vodka and that was about it. Apparently they ran out of orange juice, but frankly, even if they hadn't, it still wouldn't be a proper peach Bellini. On my end, the sangria was ordinary and while I could taste alcohol, that's about all I tasted. We decided to get some food and I ordered a pizza with Sopressata and mushrooms (extra) while my friend ordered the risotto. The pizza was thin crust, which is totally fine with me, though the bottom was slightly burnt. Taste-wise, it was good but there were exactly four slices of Sopressata and they didn't even cover the pizza. The amount of cheese was perfect for me since I don't really like all that much to begin with. Overall, the pizza lacked in toppings and while good, it wasn't the best I've had. In terms of size, it's pretty big. My friend thought the risotto was decent but it wasn't the best she's had. That said, it wasn't heavy so she appreciated that. 

Service: Friendly.

The host looked like Sleezy P Martini from Gwar and the assistant host looked like a Tinker Bell reject.  The farthest you can sit here is 9 rows back, so every seat in the house is a good seat.  This adults only show was a mix of amazing circus act, burlesque, plus raunchy comedy.  There was not a dull moment in the show.  My favorite were the lovers on the rope and the duo skaters.

"Within our household we don't purchase vehicles often, but when we do, those vehicles have always been pre-owned Hondas. Recently we decided that it was time to purchase new as we were having trouble finding exactly what we wanted in older models, and the price point was not significantly higher than pre-owned.

We live in Bloomington, IL so Champaign was not the first place we looked. A day after doing various online quotes, Richard from BMW of Champaign reached out and listened to exactly what we wanted. Due to a strict ""Dave Ramsey"" budget we were not ready to purchase for another 3 months, however Richard said no problem and contacted us at a later date we provided. Although Richard was extremely passionate about getting us what we wanted, not once did we feel pressured. And during pricing negotiation, it always felt like a win-win transaction.

At the end of the day, we chose Honda and BMW of Champaign because of two things, customer service and price. Richard offered a military incentive that really helped bring the price to a place no other dealer would, and trust me we asked other Honda dealers if they could offer the same military ""type"" savings, but none in central IL would meet Champaign's price. In addition to price, and possibly the deciding factor, Richard said something that no other dealer did when we inquired about military discounts, he thanked me for my service. Although I'm not much for military recognition, something about his sincere appreciation meant a lot and made him stand out among the rest, even though we never met face to face until the day we purchased. 

Lastly, we appreciate the time that other Honda dealers and salesman in the surrounding area spent with my spouse and me during our search. We had to make the best financial decision for our household and do what felt right, and that was with Richard at Honda and BMW of Champaign. We couldn't be more happy with our decision.",1.0

The fun guos were also subpar, any proper dimsum restaurant would probably do a better job.",1.0

"During the lunch hour I purchased an 8 piece Spicy Chunky Salmon Roll to go, for my wife, who was in a rehab center in the neighborhood.  I guess raw fish is usually not served in a medical facility around here, maybe in Japan ;)
The salmon tasted fresh and it was an attractive roll, $8 well spent as I wanted to increase her protein intake.  I tasted it and there was plenty of fish in small chunks, good wasabi and pickled ginger slices, rice, etc, an attractive package.

Came here for happy hour apps and drinks. The tank was spectacular with the different varieties of fish.....I just wish we had better service. The young blonde girl who served us in the beginning was moody and irritable - told us wrong info regarding happy hour- generally made us feel unwelcome.

"We went to see Carousel. The production was quite well done, although it could have used some. Three hours is simply too long for an amateur production. The food, average, but the service was so awful. There was a sign on the table for a $24 bottle of wine, but the waitress told us they were out of that and there was no substitution so we ordered by the glass. Later, when the manager came by, I said it really wasn't right that the sign was still there, and we were told there was a sub...but she did not offer to in any way to make it right. Oh, we could have bought an additional bottle for the $24, but we already had and paid for two glasses. That was just too bad. Then the waitress came over and complained that we had said anything to the manager. Really? This is my fault? Mediocre food, three l-o-n-g hours of amateurs, and snotty service...don't think I'm going back any time soon.",1.0
"Ordered a triple Americano. I was impressed by the fact that it only cost $3.05 for a triple. Especially when places like Lux or Lola are $3 for a single. But then I found out why. The triple Americano was served in a 12oz cup and was really weak for being a triple. And while it was hot, it didn't seem as hot as it should have been. I am concluding that either my Americano did not have a triple shot OR there was too much water. I'm leaning toward the former given that even a REAL 12oz triple shot would taste stronger despite the 12oz cup. 

On top of this, when I asked the woman at the counter if the drink was mine or not, she had to ask the barista but only after she put her hand all over the cup and even the lid. Who does that?

She was very talkative but casually mentioned that their old barista was fired, yes fired. I did not inquire about the old barista, and didn't even know there should be an old barista, let alone thought I needed to know why they were no longer there. Professional, much?

"With a love for fine dining, a propensity to shop Chanel, and an inherent joie de vivre, I think I may have been Parisian in a previous life. Granted I may not be a Sartre-reading, chain-smoking intellectual, but the Francophone lifestyle has always intrigued me ... which is probably why I'm smitten by Chabrol, a charming boîte in the heart of Yorkville.

Hidden away in an unassuming little alley on the popular Yorkville Avenue, Chabrol has all the charm and quaintness you'd expect of a cosy French bistro, sharing it's space with a chic boutique.

The open kitchen houses just two induction burners and a small convection oven. This is where the magic happens. Sitting at the bar allows you to take in all the action -- like a well-oiled machine, plates are served, admired, enjoyed, cleared, drinks are poured, and before you realize it, you're in a mutual admiration society with the anonymous diner beside you. It truly is something to watch.

But the food ... oh, the food ... is where Chabrol truly shines.

The Riesling-poached foie gras with black currant and salsify was decadent and buttery goodness. And we watched in delight as the whitefish, wrapped in parchment, was delicately cut open, releasing a light aromatic steam and welcoming the generous drizzle of Vermouth-infused butter. While the chicken may have been the understated dish of the evening, it in no way failed to impress as well.

But the true piece-de-resistance was the Ttoro, a southern France take on bouillabaisse which had me returning for more. Mussels, shrimp, mackerel and snapper fish bathed in saffron-scented broth, and it took all our energy to not lick the plate clean.

Our dashing sommelier schooled us on the origin of the word Chabrol - a term that roughly means to empty one's wineglass into the dregs of a soup bowl in order to draw out the meal - something Frenchmen would do to sneak in a few more glasses of wine during dinner and not anger their wives!

But whatever you do, don't skip dessert. Watching the sabayon being gently poured on top of the warm apple tart is what dreams are made of.

Perhaps it's the ingenuity of a restaurant that claims no need for a fully equipped kitchen, or the appeal of a space that can only fit about 19 diners indoors (the restaurant has about 20 outdoor tables during the summer months), or the handsome sommelier with his rolled up sleeves and tattooed arms oozing that irresistible Frenchman charm....but Chabrol, you had me at ""Bonjour"".",1.0

Food: as some of the other reviews I have read. All sort of meh. They said the fried chicken was famous- I didn't particularly like it. Only given thighs and drum sticks. Be prepared- it is extremely greasy and the skin isn't all that flavourful. The tomato dish and edamame were excellent. The pork dishes were unpleasant. The fried pork belly in particular was very chewy. Nothing exuded a sense of freshness. The dips with pork and chicken were the same and thick ""ketchup-like"".

Overall it was a wonderful meal, and I told Max not to be surprised if he saw me again during my trip!",1.0
"In a world of notoriously shitty internet and cable companies, I have to say that CenturyLink is unequivocally the worst.  I also got bait-and-switched, like the reviewer below me.  In fact, I am on hold right now with these assholes trying to cancel my service and just get all of my money back.  

I found a $69.94 'bundle' for high speed internet and tv (purportedly available here: http:\/\/www.centurylink.com\/home\/bundles\/).  Looked like I would be paying nearly HALF of what I was paying for DirecTV--no brainer, right?  Sounded too good to be true though, so I was adamant about ensuring the 'out-the-door' price before they did the install.  I asked the sales rep on the phone - he confirmed - asked him to send me something in writing - said he wouldn't do it.  Cable guy comes out and installs the package.  As he's walking me through everything, I  ask him what number channel the ONE premium I actually requested (HBO) in on.  It turns out, that is the only premium channel I DON'T have, and my estimated price is now going to be $174.00\/mo.+ instead of the ~ $110.0 I was quoted initially.  Moreover, he tells me that his boss told him that  (a) I can't change the channel lineup to what I actually requested; (b) he's ""never heard"" of the bundle I available at the above web address; and (c) I can't have them just take the equipment away - I'll need to call in and go through the whole cancellation process.  

I somehow get them to adjust my package so that I'm only getting the channel lineup I requested initially.  For the second time I am told that the price will be around $110.00\/month.  But when the first monthly bill arrives, I am left praying for EVEN THE $174.00--my bill is $245.91.   

I call CenturyLink, tell them the story - they tell me they will get it adjusted - no problem.  They see the issue - looks like I was charged prorated charges for the package lineup that was initially installed.  They tell me they'll remove the charges and I'll see the changes reflected in my bill in 2 days.  I call my wife, shocked - 'that was so easy - they're making the changes - no problem!'  Six days later, there is no change on the bill, which is now due imminently.  I call back and they tell me I HAVE TO PAY THE PRORATED CHARGES FOR THE CHANNELS I DIDN'T EVEN ACTUALLY HAVE - they legit tell me that, that I have to pay for services I did not actually have or use.  

This saga is ongoing - still on hold during the entire length of time it took me to write this - shocker.  They transferred me twice to the wrong department - I think I'm now finally going to 'escalation' as I wrap this up...  

I just want to cancel and get out clean now and go RUNNING back to DirecTV to ask them to take me back.  What a mistake.  This is the worst garbage service I have ever used.  Do not be lured in by the completely phony bundle deals.  They do not exist.",1.0

"I have not a slightest idea the average quality of the numerous Korean restaurants on Yonge or Bloor Street.  Hence, I am reviewing Ghingu as it appears to me in a single dining experience. 

And I loved it.  We ordered a hot pot to share ($30 for 2 people).  It came bubbling hot. The two-person portion can feed three easy, because it came with instant noodles and 2 bowls of rice.  The broth was the star of the dish.  It tasted really authentic.  It was spicy to me.  We asked to have it diluted but it was still quite spicy.  If you love authentic Korean spiciness, you will love it.  Otherwise, consider yourself forewarned.  The pork belly meat was fresh and thick.  The sausages were delicious, but I wish there were more.  The tofu could be more silky.  

We were given 6 banchan.  They tasted very good.  Kimchi and spicy cucumber were my favourites.

The services were quick and friendly.  The ambience was simple and causal.  This is a neighbourhood, family dinner kind of place.

Shops like this will try to pull an easy one over you but you have to stand up for what's right,after she finished my hair i thanked her for her services paid the 30 and left. The whole time while getting my hair braided they were looking at me laughing and the braider was super rough with my hair. I understand I have long thick curly hair but don't suck your teeth and talk about a customer sitting in your chair! Ugh so rude I will never go here ever again! I'm forced to give 1 star but if It was up to me I would give 0 stars",1.0
"Very confused by this place... Cool design, very high end prices, and then a host with old jeans and a polo. Burger was pretty good but service was terrible (you can't have waitress do a private party AND have tables in the main dining room...). Will try again and see if it gets better in regard to overall experience. Otherwise, you can get the same for much less money elsewhere.",1.0
"I would give a zero if that was an option. The technician showed and looked for 20 seconds up our main vent. We just wanted a basic clean of our vents, he said we needed sanitizing and a number of other things done too, our course all of which will cost extra. My wife told him not to worry and just complete the duct cleaning we paid for. He flat out refused and said he needed to perform a full service. Looks like Mr Duct uses the Groupon to get into your house so they can scare you into paying for extra services. I filed a complaint with Groupon, beware of using this company if you are using the Groupon. Shady bait and switch tactics from the other reviews it looks like this is their standard practice.",1.0

"Okay, I rarely leave reviews, but I have to say a few words about this place.  My husband and I are always looking for delicious Indian food at a reasonable price-- This place is it!!!  I read a few reviews of this place and we decided to try it.  We walked in near closing time, wanting to order some takeout on the way home from the kids' soccer practice.  The chef\/owner was closing up and seemed ready to leave.  I almost turned around and walked out before we ordered, but the chef insisted that he was happy to take our order and he turned the grill back on and made our food.  I was impressed.  Then when he brought the food out to us, he explained that he is a chef-- not a cook-- and that he takes a lot of pride in his work. He confidently claimed that this was going to be one of the best Indian meals we've ever had.  Boy, was he right.  My husband couldn't even wait until we got home to try the food.  The moans and groans of delight as he stuck his fork inside one of the boxes, let me know that I was in for a treat.  We ordered the chicken tikka, lamb biryani, palak paneer and a few other things.  Absolutely fresh and delicious.  And get this?  They have a weekday lunch buffet for $10!!  Perfection.  The chef\/owner is new to Vegas from D.C.-- do yourself a favor and support this business.  You won't be disappointed.",1.0

Walked in and liked the atmosphere and the friendly hostess\/server who greater us.
The menu was pleasing and well laid out.

That's where the liking ended.

-understaffed: lots of empty tables and patrons waiting when they should have been seated.

-soup was cold and gelatinous (pretty sure it wasn't supposed to be that way;-)

-entrees less than mediocre. I got the ""Crispy spicy eggplant with honey""
-It wasn't crispy. Quite soggy actually. 
-There was no honey but it was extremely sweet with a thick, artificially colored ""sauce"" that was thickened with something that was far from a natural ingredient.
-there was at least twice as much breading than eggplant.
Couldn't finish it despite being very hungry.

"I give this place 1 star because they did something very ridiculous during my layover visit at C terminal at McCarran Airport recently.  I ordered food then asked for a cup of hot water, which I have been drinking since childhood plus I would have a hard time sleeping if I ordered hot tea.  I always ask for hot water at every single fast food or restaurant I visited and there has never been a problem until I visited this place.  This one staff told me that they would have to charge me for hot tea which cost $2.29.  I told him it was ridiculous and he claimed that every restaurant in the airport did that.  I did not have time or didn't bother to verify that but I really do not believe it was the truth.  That was too petty.  How can someone do business not being generous.  They better understand they will lose thousands of customers for wanting to charge their customer $2.29 for something that hardly cost anything.  I will not give this place any more business.

"OHSO is oh so awesome! Such a fun spot for beer [LOTS of beer], food, and general hanging out. I've been here a few times with my coworkers for lunch and happy hour. We've yet to have a poor time. Service is always an A+, and they are always down to give drink\/food suggestions and refill our water glasses and beer pitchers. If you arrive early enough for lunch, you'll have a selection of seating, otherwise if you get caught up in the lunch rush, might be relegated to squeezing together for space, if with a group. 

OHSO is great at beer. period. They have a rotating selection of Arizona beers, their own taps, and some national beers. Be warned though, if you want to get a sample, those will cost you about $2\/per. I'm a huge fan of the Popsicle Blonde, it's a refreshing beer, not overtly sweet, to drink during the extreme heat. I've also had their black IPA which doesn't have the crunchy-punch of hops, but still a good beer. It's quite a steal to only pay about $6 for a pitcher for their local brews! 

The food menu is fairly average for a brewery place - appetizers\/munchies, salads, burgers, dessert, etc. Their burgers are massive and delicious, but the fries\/onion rings are nothing to be excited about. The best salad on the menu is the Ensalada Del Sol, it has a bunch of flavors to it. I look forward to my next visit!",1.0

If you like Bloody Marys, then ask for bartender Teresa's Spicy Bloody Mary. It has like, 10 different ingredients, including pickle juice and creole mustard. Very unique.

Bring your own snacks and drinks, there is the Bistro (small snack shop), but there was only one guy that was manning the lobby desk and had to step in for service at the Bistro. My only big complaint were the beds, they were so uncomfortable. There was no give, and I sleep on firm mattress at home.

"That's right a single star review. I called Home Depot hoping to get a jump on getting my central AC unit installed before the peak of summer season and before the contractors get swamped with work. It never happened.  STRIKE ONE was me taking time off work to meet the contractor for an estimate only to be called by Home Depot to say the contractor had to cancel, this was only 30 minutes before the appointment.  STRIKE TWO was arriving over an hour late for the rescheduled appointment, after cancelling on short notice the first time.  The person I met with was nice and answered all my questions and said he would have an estimate in my email by the next morning.

I had the double pancake pork burgers topped with lettuce, cheese and tomato, with pad Thai fries ($15).

I lived with my bestfriend here for two years and we barely had any problems. For the price of the place you really can't beat it! We had a two bedroom and the most we paid was 975! The pet deposit isn't TOO bad and it really does help! We had a puppy (or two) in there and we all know how they can be when you're potty training. When we moved out we barely had any fees we got lucky because our carpet was eight years old and in Nevada after five they are supposed to change it. Thank god they didn't while we lived there because when we moved out that carpet was destroyed and we didn't have to pay anything! We paid a pet smell spray of some sorts but that's about it. The maintenance was always very helpful and I loved how it was 24 hours. I loved all the ladies in the office as well they were super helpful whenever we needed them. The only thing that sucked is that our keys never worked for the pool or to any of the machines in the gym. I definitely loved living there it was always really quiet!

Once seated, the wait to be greeted by the server was also 5+ minutes (and this was consistent with all tables seated around me). The server did not introduce himself by name nor tried to make any type of conversation, menu tour, etc. All dishes and the check were dropped off to the table without a word spoken.

The bar tenders were busy running all over and loudly yelling back and forth to each other.. had to ask for drink then had to ""interrupt"" after sitting there for 20 minutes to ask for a menu. Do not come here if you have had a long day and are looking to relax or unwind. It is hectic, loud, messy and you will not be a priority. Food was average and clearly thrown together.

The Creamsicle had distinct orange and vanilla flavors, great together (mine), the cherry was bright and sweet (wife's), and the rainbow stole the show in the eyes of my six year old. 

Worth every bit of the 30min drive from my house to have this cool treat on a hot AZ night.

"I cannot recommend this place for hosting a party. 

They used draconian means to extort an extra $75 for a ""food handling"" fee and even called the police to ensure we paid... at a six year old's party!   

When we had the phone pre-party ""checklist"" call, their representative mentioned their food policy and said that we can only bring cake and ice cream.  We said that we wanted to bring pretzels and grapes and they verbally agreed that would also be fine.  We also mentioned that we would be bringing our own beverages not once but twice in the conversation.  

So, on the day of the party, we showed up with our snacks, water and juice boxes.   That's when they said we couldn't bring any drinks, even though this rule wasn't discussed when we booked the party.   While caught by surprise, we balked and they agreed to let us bring water, but not juice boxes.   I asked what drinks they could sell us, but they only have soda and Minute Maid Lemonade.  Minute Maid has artificial food coloring which we can't give to our son and we (like many other parents) choose not to give our kids sugar and caffeine loaded soda.   I asked if we could pay a fee to bring in juice, but the manager said that was not possible.  Fine... not worth making an issue.  

Then... toward the end of the party (it was still going on), they gave us the ""bill"" with a $75 ""food handling"" fee.  We were told this this was for bringing in pretzels and grapes.   REALLY?  They brought the pretzels in for us!  When we questioned this, the manager said that the owner told her to charge us this fee.  This amount was simply fabricated and not written in any of their policies or literature, mentioned ahead, or agreed...even though I specifically asked if I could pay a fee.  Why did they mention this fee only after we served the pretzels and grapes?  When we told them the person on the phone told us this was OK, they would not even consider that this could have occurred.  My wife was basically called a liar over this.  Our entire family always tries to operate with the utmost integrity and honesty in all of our dealings - being told that we were untruthful about this was very offensive.  The manager raised her voice to us and insisted we resolve this DURING our party.   I said I'll finish the party and then resolve.   The owner refused to talk to us and the manager then called the police before we even finished the party in apparent effort to force us to pay the $75.   

I later spoke with the owner, who was upset at me for ruining his day at the mall with his family because he had to come in to work over this.  He wasn't interested at looking at anything from my point of view or willing to refund the $75.  It was unfortunate that the owner insisted we must be lying about what we were told in advance and told his manager to charge us this random amount and call police if not paid vs. either talking to us or considering the possibility that we brought snacks and drinks based on what we were actually told.  

The place could actually be fun if the food and drink aspect were not so terribly managed.  The whole day was tainted over a lot of nonsense and poor communication.

In the summer there is always a long lineup of people,  kids bouncing with excitement,  adults discussing one flavour versus another.  Outside people sitting on the street or standing with their dogs while someone inside gets their scoop.

Lovingly renovated! The tiling sparkles when you walk in. Beautiful exposed brick and solid wood panels. Top notch cocktails and modern food pairings. Radishes with hummus.

The ownership shows a love of food and attention to atmosphere. Service was friendly and professional. Local food and wine highlighted.,1.0
"Small hole-in-the-wall type joint in Phoenix. Free chips and salsa is always a good start to a meal! I got the beef tamale plate with a carne asada taco.

"Hands down, the best Starbucks I've been to. Truth be told, I don't normally frequent Starbucks locations because I find their coffee too expensive for the quality, too sweet to my liking, and too crowded for my taste. 

Nonetheless, I have to give credit to this Starbucks location. My husband and I needed to crash at a Starbucks for several hours before our flight out of Vegas (let me tell you, this is the story of our lives - waiting for flights); we had three options near Planet Hollywood and discovering this location was, like, striking gold. 

1. Not that many customers. I hate crowded places. 
2. The setting is close to glamorous. Maybe it's partly Vegas-style or partly Hilton-style but whatever the reason, it works. It's classy as hell.

"For a 24 hr place, I'd like to think they'd be ready for customers at all hours of the night. 3 of us got off work and went over there at 3:30am. We couldn't tell if they were actually open because it was dark, the place looked absolutely trashed and we didn't see a single movement inside. If it weren't for the giant banner that said 24 hrs, we wouldn't have known they were open at all.  We see a guy emerge from the kitchen because I assume he saw our cars pull up, so we go inside. We order, pay, etc. I ordered a Coke with my wrap, but they didn't have fountains, just bottles. The only bottles I saw were in a tub of what used to be ice hours ago next to the register. I was not aware I was supposed to grab one of the room temperature Cokes that have been sitting there since who knows when and the cashier didn't seem interested in either getting a fresh one or offering a cup of ice. You know what, this is going to take all night, so I'll just break it down:

- 2 wraps and a salad took 20 min for the wraps and another 10 min for the salad to come out.
- 1 of the wraps was Thai chicken, and there wasn't a single piece of chicken on it. Not like it lacked a decent amount, the literal chicken part was missing.
- When told about the missing chicken, the worker who's name I can't recall but weighed about 60 lbs said, quote, ""Oh, yeaaah. I knew I forgot that part."" He knew and apparently thought no one would notice. The pregnant woman noticed and was not pleased.
- I can't tell how many interactions we had with the worker after that, but we did watch him change his gloves maybe twice, in between touching the doors to deliver food, constantly pulling his pants up, making other orders for the other people that came in, etc. 
- When my friend with the salad became extremely skeptical about the cleanliness of her food after not touching it because of the glove thing, she asked for a refund and while the worker offered a refund with no problem, he complained that he wasn't even supposed to be there. Cool story, bro. Doesn't mean you get to act careless when it comes to basic health code stuff.

Salad friend swears the service and everything else is way better midday, but if you're going to be a 24 hr place, it should be consistent. Never again. I'll wait for Jamba Juice to open at 7 from here on out.",1.0

Synopsis:The Toxic Avenger is a charming love story and laugh-out-loud musical that has it all: an unlikely hero, his beautiful girlfriend, a corrupt New Jersey mayor and two guys who play... well, everyone else ... bullies, mobsters, old ladies and stiletto-wearing back up singers.  

The two guys who play everything else were my favorite part of the whole play. I mean, the play was good, funny, with fun characters. But those two and each character they played just got better and better. Whenever they came on the stage it was a guaranteed laugh for me. I also loved the mother\/nun\/mayor. She made me laugh so much. And her voice and acting was really, really great. 

The play was fun to go to and what is not to love when you can order food and drinks while watching a play!

One of the people who took part in writing this play also wrote, ""I love you, your perfect, now change"" a play that I adore. This play while good, was not on the same caliber as that other one. Would I see it again, probably not, but will I go to the CLO again, for sure!",1.0

He used impressive software at his office to develop a confidence-inspiring design based on our vision and budget. We appreciated that he willingly offered suggestions on material combinations based on his experience. Restoration posed different challenges from a new-build. When demo uncovered a structural surprise, Doug reworked our design and incorporated a tiled seating area that we wouldn't have otherwise considered.

I made a reservation through Open Table but didn't really need make a reservation for Saturday night dinner on the long Memorial Day weekend (it wasn't that packed). 

Experience and atmosphere was nice. Patio seating is available that overlooks Las Vegas Blvd and Treasure Island\/Wynn\/the mall (corner view). The service was awesome and the food was delicious. We had steaks, pasta and the raw oysters. A plus was that Morel's had a children's menu!! SCORE! You seldom have children's menus at high end places, this helped out as I had my young son with me. Raw oysters ($20 for 1\/2 dozen) was super fresh and tasty. My ""prime"" rib eye Bordelaise was good ($66) but a bit over cooked, I asked for medium rare and it was almost medium. Mom's linguini clams was good, the pasta sauce was perfect for dipping the bread and Morel's added tons of clam.

"If you choose to come here, follow this advice: AVOID SADIE. There is always a group of individuals who sit on the back benches with a group of their dogs that are antisocial and mean. Why you would come to a dog park with a dog that does not play well with others is beyond me. Every time I've come here, Sadie has snarled, bit, and lurched at another dog, sometimes successfully getting in a bite. I was here today with my one and a half year old pup, and right before we left, he trotted over to say hello to Sadie. He simply sniffed her side when she quickly pinned him, tearing at his eyes, ears, and rib cage. She ripped open his eye, realizing a fountain of blood into his eyeball. I cannot describe the sounds of pain he made as she continued to snarl and bite him. The owners just sat there yelling as I tried my best to pull my dog out of Sadie's mouth. 

Luckily, there were many kind souls and sweet dogs to instantly ran over to my pup to make sure he was okay. He needs medical attention, and that is something the dog park will be hearing about.

"We booked the LINQ hotel in Las Vegas for my wife's birthday. Since she really enjoys going to spa's and being pampered, we decided to check out the Spa and LINQ hotel. It was truly amazing! They take you on a tour before booking which is great so we could see everything they had to offer. We were so impressed with everything, instead of booking for her alone I booked for myself as well and I'm not even into stuff like this lol. They offer an all day access pass to the SPA for one $20 per person. I think that is very reasonable considering most won't pay, so it's something you can enjoy without the crowd. What I liked was their showers, salt cave and the whirlpool but more than anything their private lounge area. My wife loved her massage. They offer a number of different massages ranging from $120-$200. We definitely will be visiting again.",1.0
"A good range of product here! Like, I'm actually quite impressed. Walking around the store reminded of all those little bits and pieces I've been meaning to buy for a while but never had to go out of my way for (sunflower seeds, anyone?) 

I like that it goes further than just food and supplements, there is also a really decent range of natural beauty products and candles for the home which made the protein section smell very appealing. 

Service was good, staff seemed friendly enough and the shelves were well stocked with product- none of that empty shelf business. 

I'd probably come back to this store if in need of anything further since I'm happy with the product available.",1.0
"I'd rather chew broken glass than speak with anyone from this place again. This was such a horrific experience. Very disorganized group, impossible to speak to the same person twice. We were set to sign, and met with a notary only to review the paperwork they had provided and find multiple errors that would have benefitted them at our expense. They tried to charge us an extension fee that was the result of their errors, and had input that they paid for our appraisal and termite inspection when we had paid them. When we called to discuss this, they said we needed to provide them proof that we had paid. We asked if there was ever a situation wherein THEY paid for a termite inspection and repairs, as well as an appraisal. She admitted she hadn't come across one, but still wanted us to prove we paid these things. Ridiculous. 

My advice would be to use them if you want to shorten your life by about 15 years. The process took just shy of a month and a half to complete, and wasted hours and hours and hours of our time.",1.0

"Went during Winterlicious for a Tuesday dinner.
For $35, I had the carrot soup, venison stew, and apple+cranberry crumble.

--PROS--
The soup was excellent. It was creamy and at the same time still had enough of the carrot's texture leftover. Wish they gave more though.
The stew was good. Not as good as the soup, but decent.

The service is as expected for an establishment under the 'licious banner (except for the hostess).

The atmosphere, decor, ambiance was good, although it has a few issues that could be fixed if they wanted to.

My mom and dad had the cappuccino. She claims it was the second best cappuccino she's ever had. Dont know how significant that is cause she doesnt usually drink coffee anyways, but she likes so posting it here.

--MEH--
The desserts are a bit small for my liking. But it is dessert. Owell.

The place could be a tad brighter, but that's probably just personal preference.

And as a few yelpers have mentioned, the noise level is a bit too high. Probably something to do with the sound absorption materials of the ceiling, walls, and kitchen (dinning hall and kitchen are pretty much one room). Or the fact they tried packing in too many tables.

--CONS--
The tables were too crowded. I'm pretty sure if there's a fire in the kitchen (beside our table), breaking the windows would be faster than heading for the doors. There's a few spots where the waiters themselves needs to walk sideways to get through.

Portions for the entree was too small. My brother asked for McD even before the bill has arrived, and he eats less than me. I dont feel the price justified the small portions. I didnt expect it to be full, but certainly not a feeling of hunger still. Had to go get BK nuggets after ($2 for 10).

But my biggest concern was the hostess. I'm assuming it was one of the owners as she didnt serve any of the tables and mainly stood at the station beside the entrance. 
She saw us when we walked in, but no smile or eye contact and proceeded to explain the menu to another customer. Ok, fine, she's busy, whatever. After she finished, she walks to the kitchen to do something for a bit, comes back and avoids eye contact with me and starts pressing the reservation screen. Glances at me and asks me the cordial ""How are you?"". I respond and asks the same, silence. Ok, fine, straight to the point then. I told her our reservations, she finds it, grabs some menus, turns around, and mumbles ""This way"" (which I can barely hear). Walks to a spot two tables away to the our tables and then just looks a me. Pauses for a bit, and then squeezes between the chairs of other customers to get to our table, places our menu on the table and walks off. We still havent received a smile or a feeling of a warm welcome. Ok, fine, she was busy and tired so had to half ass that, ok.
Our entree came and we're enjoying it. She comes over and does the courteous ""How's everything so far?"" No eye contact at all when asking that. None! Then walks off even before waiting for our response. What the heck!

==OVERALL==
Based on overall experience, I would avoid because of the service of one person.
The place itself isnt too bad and the food is actually quite good. Although the portions themselves could be bigger given the price.

For $35 Winterlicious dinner, I'd suggest another restaurant.",1.0

"I understand busy, and I know specialists are in demand, especially in the East Valley, as it seems most specialists are concentrated in the West Valley. When my rheumatologist closed her practice in July, I began the search for a new one. Carolyn Pace was highly recommended and had some good reviews. I called to see if she was accepting new patients. The ""person"" who answered the phone was actually a computer message, saying that if I was interested in auditioning (basically) to be one of Dr. Pace's patients, that I had to email my name, situation, phone number, etc. and that I would hear back in a few weeks. 4 weeks, no reply.

I call again and ask to speak to a human, only to be told I had to email if I wanted to be considered as a patient. I explained that I HAD emailed, a month ago, and was Dr. Pace accepting new patients or not? Because if she's not, no harm, no foul, I'll look elsewhere. I once again was directed to email. 

I emailed in August. I emailed in September. I emailed in October. No response. Fortunately, I found a great new rheumatologist in Mesa, but you know what? Even if the AMAZING Dr. Pace ever decided to call back to let me know I'd been deemed worthy to be one of her patients, I'll tell her off. I wouldn't trust anyone this arrogant, wishy-washy, and disrespectful in charge of my care. If you don't want new patients, just say so, already, don't string people along with a ridiculous email audition system.",1.0

Great service and very friendly and attentive. However the coffee was average and the food too. The bacon was good.

"I guess I'm one in a million because I didn't care for Dr. Sawyer during our last appointments together. I've decided not to use him to deliver our baby after meeting with him 3 times.  It's interesting none of these reviews mention how conservative and stiff he is, but I found that out on my own.  Yes, his nurses and staff are very nice though.
My Husband and I met with Dr. Sawyer for the first time late 2014 for a pregnancy consult when we were thinking about starting a family.  We met with him in his office and he spent a good deal of time talking with us about getting off of birth control and how to give my body time to adjust and all that good stuff.  After the meeting I thought he was very personable,  nice, and soft spoken.
Flash forward to January 2016 and I'm pregnant after trying for only 1 month! :)  I was very excited, so I called Dr. Sawyers office since we had felt comfortable with him before.  I made my first appt. with him at 8 weeks pregnant.  My husband and I showed up to the appt., met with Dr. Sawyer and we got to see our little jelly bean on the monitor :)  He told us we couldn't hear the heartbeat yet so he wasn't even going to try....Ok. That's fine, but that's not entirely true.  You can hear the baby's heartbeat as early as 7 weeks for some women, but I didn't push it because it was early and I thought, probably next time we'll hear it for sure.  At the end of that appt. I asked about genetic tests such as the NIPT or the NT scan, as I will be 35 by the time I deliver...He kindof skirted the issue, but said yes those were tests out there available.  He said to think about it and we would discuss it at our next appt. at 12 weeks.  He asked if my Husband and I were Catholic...Excuse me?  Strike 1....What does that have to do with anything?  He was basically implying that if we were Catholic the tests shouldn't matter to us..That is completely his opinion and not a medical one and I thought it was downright unprofessional to push his religious views on us.  It's really none of his business what our religion is or what we will do with the information gained from the tests.  He's lucky I didn't give him a piece of my mind right then and there.
Today I'm in my 12th week of pregnancy (nearing the end of my first trimester), I went in for for my follow up appt. earlier this week where I thought I would hear the baby's heartbeat and discuss\/perform testing options...Dr. Sawyer was probably a solid 30 minutes behind schedule and we waited longer than the time we actually spent with him.  When he comes into the room he says, want to see your baby?  No, hello...No, how have you been feeling since I last saw you?  Nothing...Just, want to see your baby....I said yes, of course, and he got right to business.  He pulled baby up on the monitor and it was an amazing sight to see once again.  I asked if we could hear the heartbeat this time and he said no, it's too early...What??  STILL too early??  His reasoning was, it could take me 20 minutes to find the heartbeat and sometimes it scares moms and they think their baby is dead....What an insensitive thing to say I thought...So basically you're saying I can't hear the heartbeat because you don't want to take the time to find it???  Strike 2....Don't slow play me when I know it's not medically too early to hear the baby's heartbeat...You just don't want to do it for whatever reason.  Once he was done that was pretty much the end of the appt.  Instead of talking about the testing options I thought were going to discuss, he starts talking to my husband about....FOOTBALL....UM EXCUSE ME??? We're here to discuss our baby!  Our baby's health!  And you bring up my Husband's job and football?!?  STRIKE 3....That was unacceptable.  He then said he would see us back in 1 month and left the room.  I was left to stare at my Husband in awe of what had just happened.
I said to him, weren't we suppose to talk about testing options today?  I'm almost at the end of my first trimester and I'll miss the window for certain tests if they're not done in time.  I was completely disappointed and felt let down and left in the dark with this Dr. Allen Sawyer.  I spoke to his nurse afterwards and asked why I hadn't been tested for anything so far...All she could say was that Dr. Sawyer doesn't ""believe"" in a lot of testing and if I wanted some he would perform them during the 2nd trimester...
UNACCEPTABLE.
The next day, I found a doctor from the 21st century who I feel is more my speed.  He's requesting my records and I feel happy and confident with the switch.  I also got the tests I wanted done the same day I spoke with the new doctor and I didn't have to beg and plead to do it!",1.0

However, the grilled cheese sandwich was tasty mostly due to the bread they use (ACE bakery); the messy fish sandwich was a yummy break from meat. For $15 each, these two dishes were good.

"Unfortunately, I didn't look up the reviews on this place until I had been sitting, waiting for my car after the 40 min mark.  I moved up here a few months ago from Ahwatukee & went to a F&S down there in Chandler (they're great down there, btw -I should probably leave a review for them, lol).

This place must be under different ownership\/management & that's unfortunate. It took over 45 min to get my car, the back half was water-spotted from sitting in the sun due to the backup of cars. The employees were scrambling & obviously under-staffed (not their fault). Finally got to my car & the trunk had not been vacuumed, at all. So I had to drive it around & wait. Again.

"This place used to be my go to spot to get a haircut every few weeks. However, there has been significant changes in the team of barbers who work there (my preferred barber left). The last time I went there, the stylist didn't seem to know what he was doing. Didn't ask how I wanted my sideburns or if the length was okay. Seemed rushed given the line of customers. In addition, the person I had for this cut was not a barber but rather a stylist. Didn't use a straight razor to clean up the neckline or anything. Won't be going here again. Felt very weird in the last sitting and won't be going back.",1.0
"This place deserves a solid 4.5 stars so I am giving it five.  The place is nice and roomy with an open air patio so you can people watch.  They have lots of comfy seating, tables, booths and couches.  They have a big jenga game you can play and maybe other games, I can't remember.  TV's showing various games.  We were here on a Friday evening about 9 or 10 and they had a fun selection of music with videos playing.  The beer price was average.  $5.00 for a bud light.  Not the cheapest around but doable.  This part of Scottsdale is hopping!  Great place to see or be seen.  We would stop in again.",1.0
"Assigned seats can be a total drag when they're covered  in somebody's sticky mess. I couldn't even sit down my seat when we first got there.  I had to find someone to come and wipe it down, then when I tried to put the foot rest up it was covered in something sticky and then when I tried to put my arm on the armrest it was also covered in something sticky. Needless to say I spent the entire movie extremely uncomfortable and trying to find a place to put my legs and my arms without getting stuck to the seat. To be honest you pay a premium to see a movie in these small theaters and to sit there totally uncomfortable the entire movie really sucks! So a word of advice bring some wipes with you if you'd like to enjoy your movie.",1.0

"I've been waiting for 4 months to go to Fuddruckers. It was one of our favorite places to go for burgers in San Diego California. However it's far from where I live. So today March 25th 2016, I came out to summerlin to eat here finally. Boy was I disappointed! The place was very dirty & the food wasn't good at all.  Our buns on our burgers were stale & the frings we ordered tasted like dirty oil & precooked then redipped when we ordered them. There was absolutely no seasoning on the burgers or fries. Our food was cold & they had barely any produce to put on the burgers. It was 6pm on a Friday night & the restraunt was very empty however alot of the tables were dirty with dishes on them & not wiped down. I had to ask the girl at the register if they could wipe down our table! Her response was we do when people leave were are you sitting & what tables are dirty? My response was almost all of the tables. The cheese sauces were dripping all over the sides of the containers, the coke machine was dirty & very sticky. The floors are horrible with sauces on them. Bathrooms are just as bad. After eating my burger only, without the bread, I told a worker that came to the table about my experience with the bread & she talked to the manager then told us he doesn't know why they gave us stale buns, when they have fresh ones that they made today. My whole thought process of this Fuddruckers is horrible. It ruined my whole night out especially driving 30+ miles to get here. I will never go here again.",1.0

"General rule of thumb: condescension toward your customers is never a good look, but if you're going to try it anyway, your quality better be damn good. Unfortunately, at Matt's it was just ok. Want half and half in your coffee? Prepare for a lecture from the waitress (who has been alive for fewer years than I have been drinking coffee) about how they only offer whole milk, but it's organic and you will be surprised by how delicious it is if you give it a try. Want salami in your omelet instead of ham? They charge $5 extra because the salami is ""really high quality."" Never mind that the salami scramble on the menu costs less than an omelet with ham.

"About a 2-2.5: Yokato Yokobai is a small little ramen shop that is located down the hall from Ichigo Ichie.  The menu is pretty small and straight to the point (it's a piece of paper that you just fill out with a golfer pencil), offering tonkotsu-based broths - there is the regular Tonkotsu Pork, Tonkotsu Chicken, Tonkotsu Vegetable, as well as an option to make the tonkotsu a bit spicier (in which they label it as 'Kara-Miso') - there are 3 options for this version as well (the pork, the chicken, and the vegetable).  You have the option to add extra meat and\/or noodles, as well as customize the saltiness (less, normal, or more), the amount of green onion (none, normal, or more), addition of nori (none, 1-piece, or 5-pieces), and an egg (non, 1\/2 portion, or a whole).  Those who are vegetarians have an option for a vegetable ramen broth.  There are also salads, gobos, karaage, and chashu-don, as well as homemade yuzu, vanilla or green tea ice cream.  The hubs had the regular Tonkotsu Pork with regular saltiness, more helpings of the green onion, 1-piece of nori, and 1\/2 of the egg - the broth was super milky and creamy, and maybe a bit too decadent and thick for some.  It had a taste similar to cream of mushroom, so there may have been an addition of heavy cream or milk.  The thin noodles were cooked al dente and I was happy that they did not have a gummy taste to them.  I had the Kara-Miso Pork version, in which there was a little melon-ball scoop of 'hot paste' - however, this wasn't at all spicy, and just made the broth more red.  I had the same customization (the regular saltiness, more helpings of the green onion, 1-piece of nori, and the 1\/2 egg) - I thought that this was slightly better than the regular Tonkotsu broth, but again, it still had the super milky\/creamy taste.  In addition, we tried the Karaage (fried chicken with some type of a soy-based sauce - the sauce was not good at all, as it was more sweeter and had an overwhelming amount of herbs; I'd much rather prefer a cup of Kewpie mayo), and the Chashu-Don (this had pulled pork mixed in with rice, sesame seeds, radish, ginger slices, green onions, and mayo - the hubs was not a fan, as it was just way too much going on; I thought it was the better-tasting out of all the main items we had ordered.  For dessert, I tried the homemade Yuzu ice cream - this was more of a sorbet, and I really liked it!  It was tangy, sour, and citrus-like, and super refreshing.  This was definitely the highlight of the whole entire meal!  Service was fine, but the host\/server was MIA and pretty inefficient.  We had to get our own chopsticks and utensils and refill our own water.  On a side note, there is a rack by the rear entrance with some Japanese snacks.  I'm glad I was able to try this place out, but I won't be back.

"This place was super cute. The Bartender Dilian took great care of my party. Every drink that he offered was delicious, he started to make my Monkey See Monkey Do a double. This made my drink amazing I fell in love.  My favorite drink at the moment. I also had the potato chips and dip which was good, very crunchy and flavorful. The patio was beautiful, they have a couple of fire pits that you can sit around which keeps you warm during he cold months.  I can't wait until the summertime because the pool is a couple steps away, a new hang out spot.",1.0
I only have one drink that I like from Chatime and its the wintermelon mousse.  I request it made with no sugar and no ice.  Its actually already made that way.  LOVE IT!  The natural sweetness of the drink in contrast with the savoury mousse.  Tantalizing flavours make for a delicious refreshing beverage.  They make it just right every single time.  I appreciate consistency in the product from Chatime.  Great local hangout.  This location is in the new Markham VIP Threatres so its very chic.  Packed all the time and open pretty late as well.  Definitely the new hot spot.,1.0
"The only reason I went to JMJ was because I received a Groupon for service (inspection and oil change). Not only was this very helpful in making my decision, but their inspections cost $20 less than the place I have been going for the last couple of years.

They were very friendly, courteous and were very accommodating. I dropped my car off in the morning and received a call later in the afternoon that it was finished and ready for pickup. The service was efficient and everyone who I interacted with was very nice.

"We came here as a large party of 10 at 1pm on a weekday and the wait was 1 hour! And they don't take reservations. 

I ordered their appetizer of chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps. I was not impressed. It was bland, one note, and had none of the lightness that I had hoped in ordering a lettuce wrap. Instead, it came on a bed of rice noodle puffs and with lettuce that was hardly conducive to actual wrapping. The lettuce was stalky and would have been better if I was eating it with a dip. Big leafy lettuce for lettuce wraps, please, like the kind that Vietnamese restaurants know to provide with their egg rolls. Moreover, the chicken and mushroom filling for my wrap looked brown and unappetizing. A bit of color would've made it more appealing, like some red bell peppers or green onions.  Plus the chicken was dry. 

The rest of my party seemed to enjoy their food though a couple of others also commented that some of their dishes were bland. Many of us ordered cheesecakes to go, but it took FOREVER. We even asked our waitress whether we should put in our to go orders as we put in our dine in order, and she said that we could do it at the end when we're ready for the check. So we did that, but then waited another good 30 minutes after paying the check for our to go orders to come out. It's no wonder the wait is so long to get seated here. Also, because we all ordered different kinds of cheesecakes, they brought it out to us but didn't label them or tell us what they were. It took some deduction on our part to figure which ones went with whom.  

The one bright spot was the key lime cheesecake I took home. Perfectly tart yet rich and buttery on the tongue. It was decadent. I savored each bite and wished I had also ordered the salted caramel cheesecake.

The breading on the meat was good, but not as crispy as I'd prefer, while the sauce added a touch of sweetness to add depth to the flavors.",1.0

"Village Tavern has been our ""go to"" place for years.  We have always enjoyed taking friends there and celebrating special events.  Following that tradition, we recently planned a dinner to celebrate a birthday.  As normal for high season, the place was packed with people waiting for tables.  We had reservations and were seated promptly.  That was a highlight of the evening.

Upon being seated, we immediately noticed a big change in the lighting with brightly shining spotlights over most of the tables with large chandeliers in several places in the dining room.  In the past, it has always been somewhat dim with small lights over the tables, giving a nice intimate atmosphere.  Now it's feeling like a big cafeteria.  I asked our server about the change and he said they had recently remodeled, including the lighting.  Strike one.

Timing of service was off as well.  While we're just 2 bites into our salad, a server appears with our entrees, ready to dump and run, seemingly surprised that we weren't willing to be rushed into accepting the plates.  We sent her and the entrees away.  Eventually we finished salads and the entrees reappeared, fresh from the warmer.  The entrees were generally good as we've come to know but the veggies did not fare well due to the wait.  Strike two.

I'm hoping the management will remedy the new improved lighting.  While seemingly trivial, it's amazing what a difference it makes in the overall ambiance.  The service issue can be passed off as a minor glitch although if it had been my first visit, it might well have been my last.  Please Village Tavern, please don't make a Strike three.",1.0
"It's a sad thing, really. This location is less than a mile from our house, and we usually swing through on a weekend when headed out for errands and grocery shopping. The thinking is that we'll fill ourselves us with something nourishing and delicious so we don't throw everything we see into the cart (including things that are terrible for us). 

The last 3 or 4 times we've been here, it's been a total disappointment. It's either that they try to talk us into getting something other than what we've asked for, or they give us something that we didn't order, or what we receive is just overwhelmingly intense....whereas we've had it at other locations and it was great. 

There is never a line, but we've never been through the drive through under 15 minutes. On this trip, it was 22 minutes and a girl came to the window and asked us if we ordered the Jetty Punch and a limeade, and we had to correct her and tell her that we ordered the Detox and Avocolada (which were disgusting).

"I have been to The Golden Tiki two times now. One was a week night, and was was during happy hour on a Saturday. Both times the experience was... okay. 

Drinks -
I have had the Golden Tiki (namesake drink) and the Dark and Stormy. Out of the two I liked the Golden Tiki more. The Dark and Stormy was more ice than drink, and neither really felt fruity enough to be considered tiki. I did have a dole whip, and I am happy to say it tasted just like the one from DL. 

Atmosphere- 
The Golden Tiki definitely looks tiki. It hired terrific artists for it menu and decorating, but it does not have the feeling of a tiki bar. It seems to be more bar with a tiki theme instead of a tiki bar. One thing I like about tiki bars is that regardless of size they seem inviting. Like a friend or close neighbor has invited you over for a drink. The Golden Tiki has not reached this level yet, and it might be because it feels like it is trying to hard, or possibly not hard enough. (Sorry, I know that is vague, but the next section might explain better)

Gimmicks - 
One thing that they seem to pride themselves on (or at least I keep reading about) is the interactive aspects of the bar. The Golden Tiki mask above the bar, and the undead pirate captain skeleton in the back pirate themed room. Unfortunately both times I visited neither of these things were working. I guess you have to be there on an extremely busy night to see them.
They got the ideas for these interactive aspects from Trader Sam's in DL, but I do not think they watched carefully on how they were used.
The Golden Tiki gimmicks supposedly are more interactive, in other words they can see who is around them and customize their responses (supposedly). That sounds great, and it might be hard to do that all of the time. So yes, keep the more personalized for the busier times, however you still need to use these during the slower times. That is where pre-programmed can come into play. 
Every hour on the hour give the mask a 5-10 min spiel, and every 30 min mark have the captain come to life and tell a 5-10 min adventure from his time alive. Or have them to go off when a specific drink is ordered (which is how the Trader Sam things work)
We did find out after we left that you can ask the bartenders to wake the mask, but to be honest if you got it flaunt it. Don't make those paying ask.

"Amanda working the front dest has no reason working with the public. She is a extremely rude and unprofessional. 

I had a scheduled appointment like most do, after my appointment I had another appointment in the same building that's why I used this location. 15 minutes after my scheduled appointment time and I still had not been called I walked up to the front counter and politely asked Amanda how far behind they were on appointments. A simple question I thought. She was obviously upset by the question and went of by trying to explain that they had 15 minutes for appointments and they were at 14 minutes. I asked the same question again ""so how far behind are you in your appointments?"" She became more irritated and gave the same answer with a lot more attitude. The phebotomist was standing behind her and overheard what I was asking and ask my name and told me she would be calling me in a couple of minutes. That was the answer I was looking for. I thanked her, got a business card from the front desk to complain about Amanda. I looked at Amanda and could tell by the look in her face that she was very upset. I said ""I don't understand why that question was so difficult?""  She became even more upset and loudly and said with sarcasm ""yeah I don't know why!""
The waiting room was full of patients who witnessed Amanda's unprofessional and immature behavior.

"***Delano is a nice and modern hotel, but it is expensive and in the Mandalay Bay so it is located far from a lot of the energy and things to do on The Strip***

Delano is a modern hotel that is part of and adjacent to Mandalay Bay.  It has a separate entrance with its own lobby and café, lounge and coffee bar, and it does not have its own casino though one is just a few minutes away in the Mandalay Bay.  For some reason, I felt the lobby had an odd smell as the amount of perfume-strong scent they were pumping in was potentially conflicting with other smells in the area.

My Delano room was nice with modern décor, a comfortable bed and a few luxurious notes throughout (it felt like a very nice and new W in a big city).  My room was not that big and because the bathroom was a handicap-accessible one, it did not have the most ideal shower.

I did not use the TV, but I did like how you can use a digital switch to inform housekeeping if you prefer Do Not Disturb or that you are ready for housekeeping.  Delano does have a fitness center, but I did not check it out.  

Service was good and friendly.

Room rates are high.  You pay more than Mandalay Bay and even though the rooms are nice, Delano \/ Mandalay Bay is just so far from The Strip.  There is definitely a lot to do at the Mandalay Bay with a variety of restaurants and activities, but getting to the main action on The Strip is either a taxi ride, a very long walk or a series of free trams like the Mandalay Bay tram to Excalibur and the CityCenter tram that take a good bit of time.

Overall, Delano is a good option if you can get a great deal from an online booking site and do not mind the long trip it takes to get to the center of The Strip.  However, if the room rate is high, and you plan on spending a lot of your time at CityCenter, Bellagio or Palazzo, Delano is probably not your best option.

I heard casinos are starting to charge for parking, and Delano is charging for parking--whether it is for hotel guests or visitors stopping in for the casino, restaurants or other activities.  Self parking is $10\/night.  It is easy finding an open space.",1.0

"When you end up ordering a dinner where the main dish has to be carried out by two men as if their handling the Stanley Cup and it's a 27 pound platter of a pyramid of fried lobster and it's not the most expensive thing on the menu... well perhaps you get the picture.

If not feel free to browse the photos - the photos which really can't do justice.  To really experience this place you can't just observe a two dimensional image or even fully comprehend it with a video because you simply have to see it for yourself and actually dine here.

My friend Johnny made a reservation for a group of us to have an evening out in the east part of Toronto.  This place is just a few blocks east of Pacific Mall but is on the south side of  Steeles so this establishment is technically on the Toronto side of the border.  With a dozen friends willing to combine resources we were able to pull off quite the meal which was family style and included a bottle of wine, a couple plates of rice, soup, some vegetables, a warm nut dessert and some pretty impressive service on top of that - oh and that mountain of lobster as well.

We were actually brought the lobster to look at before it was prepared.  As if we're marine biologists we were given the opportunity to inspect the crustaceans first hand.  If we wanted we could have handled them and looked at them prior to accepting these tasty victims which were imminently destined to be our fare in the next short while.  None of us bothered to actually pick them up and check but we did have the opportunity to do so.  Other tables were taking selfies with their huge king crabs that were brought to them which was sort of something you don't see every day.  

When it comes down to it, this place is not all show.  The food is pretty impressive and it's not just the size, spectacle or grandiose display of parade after parade of superfluous platters of seafood being brought out from the kitchen to tables throughout the dining area.  The servers are very professional and precise.  You have to be when you're looking after large parties which every table basically is.  Our table for 12 was very comfortable and we were not squeezed in the least.  This table was intended for such a party and the convenience of having a lazy Susan with an appropriate diameter made sharing easier among everybody.  There is a box of disposable gloves on the table so you can eat with your hands but without having to get too messy.

The lobster platter brought to us were huge creatures indeed arranged in such an attractive way that if you have somehow forgotten that man is on the top of the food chain this will be a sober reminder that we rule this planet.  This platter is not humble and could be considered over the top.  I mean it's a lot of food but I suppose it's how one perceives this meal.  I look at it as a celebration of good times not an obscene overindulgence.  

The pieces were cut into manageable sizes that could be handled properly when taking from the pyramid.  The entire dish perhaps had a diameter of 3 feet or so.  The pyramid rested on what appeared to be a bed of fried anchovies or some other tiny fish too small to recognize.  Yes thousands of tiny fish were used as dressing...  the mountain was topped with slaw of some kind and both heads peeked out of the pile.  The pieces had a batter that gave it taste with some bits of chili and other spices to add flavor.  The meat was very moist and not rubbery or tough at all.  I wasn't sure what to expect because most whole lobster I've ever had have been about 2 pounds or less range.  These creatures well exceeded that former threshold.  The shells were cracked in such a way it wasn't very hard to get to the meat of all the pieces I had eaten.

Everything else besides the showcase platter was good but the lobster was fantastic.  I have to just think we only had the lobster and no crab.  That's another level altogether.  The meal we had was 388 dollars and when added tax, tip and divided by 12 patrons it worked out to be just over 41 dollars each.  That is really an amazing deal considering the feast we shared over a two hour dinner.  

This is definitely a place for family style eating and they specialize in groups.  Considering how many patrons they had on a Wednesday evening and the place being at capacity they served quickly, efficiently and absolutely know what they are doing as far as servicing a full dining room.  I did not feel we were lacking anything at any time as they came around to refill drinks and exchange plates and\/or take away shells, etc.

We had a late brunch one Saturday after 2pm.  Made a reservation, though I don't think most people bother.  It seemed like walk-ins were seated pretty quickly.  I ordered pan de miga, my wife revuelto.  Both were finger-licking excellent.  We split a chocolate & dulce de leche tart for dessert, which was also good.

The staff was all super polite and welcoming, but they seemed inexperienced or confused.  When we asked for the dessert menu, the waiter first began to tell us what they have.

The steak took a while to arrive, but it did eventually. Upon first cut, I can already tell that it was overcooked...there was barely any pink until I got to the middle. The steak was still quite juicy, but it definitely could've been even juicier if it wasn't overcooked. As for the prawn lobster butter, I didn't really taste much of the prawn lobster feel; there was definitely butter on it though, but it tasted like regular butter.

One of the people in my table also had an overcooked steak, and the hostess diligently exchanged her overcooked steak with a properly grilled one. I wanted to change mine as well, but opted not to since I didn't want the kitchen to waste another steak.

Service was excellent, despite the less than spectacular experience with my food. Not sure if I'll return though; I've definitely had better steak experience in several other places.",1.0

"You gave Denny's a 5-star review, so you probably couldn't afford to live here"" - Erica George, PB Bell Property Manager of High Street. 

That is the harassing message I woke up to yesterday morning from High Streets quality and professional management. First off, sue me I eat at Denny's on occasion, it's fast, the food is consistent, they treat me with respect and the bacon is always crispy and the eggs are always perfect and it costs me under $5.00.

If I could give the residences zero stars I would. Since my initial post about my experience there, things have only gotten worse. 

The management at high street and let's be honest PB Bell, are some of the most incompetent individuals I have ever run across in my life. I am astounded that PB Bell is even in business. 

Since my initial post things have only gotten worse:

First off, I personally never got any information in regards to repairs or cleaning fee's personally from Erica George. Legally, she had 30 days to get me that information and she never did. I ended up finding out that she had sent that information over to my new apartment complex that I had transferred my lease and the new property manager ended up providing the information to me. 

When looking though it I notice an astounding $800.00 charge for new carpeting - um excuse me, I lived on high street from December to April, there is no possible way I damaged the carpeting in the master bedroom or the second bedroom to the point of no repair in 5 months. Upon questioning Erica George about the charge she said my dogs had destroyed the carpet and it had to be replaced, after emailing with her back and forth for what feels like eternity she finally provided ""documentation"" of the damages. She sent me two photos: one of the carpet in my master bedroom and the second of carpet pulled up with horrendous staining on the bottom of the carpet. The shocking thing is that the second picture of the stains wasn't even from my apartment. So, the charges were totally fraudulent. 

Upon review of those pictures, PB Bell corporate was called and Heather Garcia who is Erica George's manager refused to even entertain looking at the pictures. She simply stated that if Erica said there was damage, she was going with Erica. You would think if a customer is saying there are fraudulent charges you may want to look into that since fraud is illegal.
No one returns phone calls from corporate, heck they don't even pick up their phones. They allow management to act like children without any repercussions. If I behaved like any of them at work, I would be fired. 

I don't think my complaints in general have been out of line. 

- Fix my flooring in a timely manner like you promised
- Don't fraudulently charge me $800.00 for replacement carpet. 
- Treat me with Respect and don't harass me online

The kicker to all of this is, I ran into one of my neighbors who was having issues with Erica as well, and he told me they charged him 800.00 for new carpeting as well. Must be Erica's MO, I wonder if she is getting a kick back from the so called third party vendor.
 
Super frustrating - So I am in the process of getting an attorney and taking this so much further. It's not about the money at this point, it's about the fact that they haven't treated me with an ounce of respect.",1.0
"What a busy and popular location. Everytime we come to this restaurant we have seen lines out the door for both the sit in part, and the window to go order area. We lucked out this time around, we tried our luck during a Sunday NFL morning which made fantasy football even better weekend for me. They have multiple TVs through out their restaurant, so you wont miss a beat. You can enjoy a great meal while catching your game that is either crucial to you as a fan, and as a fantasy football participant. They have tons to select from, whether you are hungry or just looking for a sugary treat to try. We did both, ordered a entree and ordered a dessert. For the entees we tried chicken and waffle, and chocolate chip pancakes. For the sugary treat we tried our first time experience with their mocha and white chocolate cold drinks. From the food to the drinks we tried, everything met our expectations, and with each bite we understood why they always had a line outside the door. This place is worth the wait, and the prices for the items are decent as well. Definitely a must try, when in town.",1.0
"Honestly, we didn't really know what to expect with this tour besides just trying it out. To our surprise, we had a great time this weekend!

With Vegas, we can either burn a lot of cash getting bottles to cut the line or wait in line at the popular places. I have friends that know promoters and was able to get on the guestlist but not being a regular there it's hard knowing different people to get you in besides having to spend so much money.

Elite VIP is so freaking fun for couple reasons. First... we get free drinks and able to get the party started right in the bus! Secondly, no freaking line! Lastly, if the club sucks and it happens, we get to hop back on the bus and get driven to another place and skip the line again!

Anyway, if you're not a regular and just want to check out different clubs in Vegas with great convenience then check them out. We'll definitely do this again.",1.0
"I've recently been on a waffle kick and was excited to see this spot open near me. Note that they specialize in waffles but also serve crepes- which is exactly what the previous business in this space sold. I am interested to see what they change to succeed where their predecessors did not.

Came in for an afternoon bite after a workout- location is very bare, one quiet employee working. She recommended the Strawberry Banana waffle, so that is what I went with. Waffle was served hot and fresh, with ample fruit and whipped topping. However, the waffle itself was  overcooked, hard and crunchy rather than chewy. Flavor was decent, looking forward to trying a savory option.

I would like to see them step up their offerings- the current menu is a little basic. Also, when I spend $10 for a single waffle, I kind of expect a real plate instead of a paper one. Upgrading their canned whipped cream to a fresh made version would also be appreciated.",1.0
"Decided to try this new place for lunch today.  We ordered the Santa Barbara burger, which did not disappoint; Char burger, sweet potato fries, onion rings and a garden salad.  We also had two beverages.  The food was delicious!  The char burger was juicy (but not too much) and wrapped so it made it nice to eat without everything spilling out.  The Santa Barbara wasn't wrapped but the way it's put together allowed it to be eaten without a big mess.  The salad's ingredients were very fresh and didn't give the appearance of having been made and sitting around.  It was also a nice mix of lettuce, not just iceberg, had tomato slices, cucumber slices, shredded carrots and croutons; it was huge.  The onion rings were nice and crisp--the batter they used had a good flavor and the sweet potato fries were very good too.

We will definitely be back because there are some other good menu items that we would like to try.  They have a nice variety of salad offerings also.  In addition, they have some not-so-run-of-the-mill offerings such as Charbroiled Albacore Tuna sandwich, Tri-tip sandwich, and tempura green beans to name a few.  You can request your sandwich be served with no bun, but lettuce ""bun"" instead...I think that's called protein style.

They have a nice condiment bar that offers jalapeños, pepperocinis, hot peppers and lemons & limes.  Also, they have a large pump with little cups for ketchup.  This is located near the beverage area and the napkins, etc. are there too.  I liked the layout because you could get your beverage, then assemble the lid, etc. and wipe the counter if you spilled and the napkins and trash are right there so it makes it easy to clean up (your mother doesn't work there...so it's always courteous to clean up...LOL!)

In addition to soda, they have a nice offering of several different teas and their strawberry limeade, which I hear they are known for but I didn't try it.  They also offer milkshakes and malts which looked good but I didn't try those either. They also offered a vitamin water from the machine.

We also liked the decor, which was a step up from the usual fast-food establishments.  The booths had nice, cushiony seats and were not so smashed in together; the 2 person booth & table top was bigger than most places so it didn't feel so cramped. They also have a nice, 10-seat hi-top ""community"" table that is convenient and allows for flexibility in seating.  Plus the decor is a bit more upscale than other places.  For example, they had nice pendant lights over that community table.  They also had a few seats outside (in the shade).  I guess I would describe it as quick food casual and not ""fast food"".

Super friendly staff also contributed to our great experience here.  They also have a drive thru if that is appealing to you.  It's sort of funky because you have to go around the bank just to the east of the Habit to access the drive thru.

Last, but certainly not least, it was very clean!  Of course it's new and we'll see if they can keep that up.  

For fast, casual, fresh & delicious food in a clean place, this like will become our go-to place! Try it out!",1.0
"I drove by this place and the name jumped at me. Found out they do poke bowls and sushi burritos.

"This place has potential but needs some serious help. A group of eight of us came in at 10:15 am on Saturday. We were sat at 10 30 we sat there a good 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order.   We all ordered the bottomless mimosas they offer on Friday, Saturday and Sunday between 9am and noon that is advertised on a poster on the wall and on their website. Well  to our disappointment we were told that this was nor offered on ""game days"". Are you freaking kidding me is what I thought.  May I suggest if this promotion is not offered on game days that you take the poster down or put an asterik on the poster saying not available on game days. We really felt this is false advertisement. When we got our drinks it was 11:10 and it was time to order but we were told breakfast was only served until 11:00am. This was very frustrating due to the fact that we had been sitting there over 40 minutes waiting for  our drinks. I ended up ordering the southern hospitality which is ironic since there was not much hospitality in regard to service. The restaurant was packed there was one bartender, two servers and a manager running food. The saving grace is the food was delicious. If this place gets some well trained,. friendly and is staffed appropriately it will make it. Also take down that poster on game days and make an exception on your website about your specials not being offered on game days.",1.0
"If I could give zero stars I would!  I called this company about repairing an expensive window shade.  We called them specifically because they advertise doing in-home repair which is what we wanted.

A man named Phil returned my call and said that he was booked up for the rest of the week (very understandable) but that he would call me on Monday to schedule an appointment to come over to fix the shade later THAT SAME WEEK.  

He called me on Monday, but said that he didn't realize he's all booked up for the week as he just got back from vacation so we set up an appointment for the following Thursday.  I was not happy about it, but again I needed in-home repair and he seemed to know what he was doing re: repairing blinds\/shades.

Two days after our phone conversation Phil called to say that his daughter is coming in for a visit and he promised his wife that he wouldn't make any service appointments so he has to reschedule until October!   That is completely unreasonable!

It's pretty obvious to me that this company does not want or need the business or they don't really WANT to do in-home service, even though the advertise it.  In any case I'll take my business and my money elsewhere.",1.0

It's a dimly yet pink-ly lit joint...someone really has to make the place feel warmer or nicer. There's also a bathroom attendant --- again, screams clubby.

The food itself is incredible. Had a 33oz chefs choice ribeye (massive, finer marbling). We also got the lobster mashed potatoes (unique and awesome). And to top it off the butter cake is a calorie bomb that is worth every bite. Don't share.

I initially wanted to get my first eyebrow tint but was recommenced to wait at least 3-4 weeks for hair to grow in certain areas of my brows.

They are pretty pricey for just the was with tipping a $20 the total did come out to quite a bit than expected. I will go here again but need to save up for another wax or both wax and tint.,1.0
"Made a reservation for ~6:45pm on a Friday and the restaurant was surprisingly only half full. The entrance of this place reminds me a lot of the restaurants in downtown Montreal. Inside, it's dim, mellow, and calm.

We were first served with bread and some hummus. I personally love hummus but I know plenty who don't, such as my friend who came with me. Would have been nice if we were offered butter or some other choices.

We ordered a cocktail (gin and cucumber), lamb shank, and cornish hen. Hands down the most amazing cornish hen I've ever had. The skin was crispy and flavourful, the meat was tender and juicy. Vegetables provided on the side were delicous too. I loved dipping the hen into the sauce on the plate. Friend's feedback on the lamb was 2.5\/5. I tried a piece and agreed with him too. It tasted like any other lamb dish you find at a decent restaurant, nothing stood out. The size of the food is definitely reasonable for what you pay. Both of us could not finish our food.

Also, I loved the cocktail! 

Service was good, we never had to ask for our water to be refilled. Our server came around every 10-15 minutes.

The restaunt was quickly filled with people at around 7:30pm. Great spot for a date night!! Would be back again for other cocktails and the cornish hen.",1.0

We had 3 different meals:

Spaghetti with meat sauce - DELICIOUS! The meat sauce is extremely hearty and flavorful

Pappardelle with pink diablo sauce - HOLY CRAP. It has just the perfect amount of kick to it and the pasta was perfectly cooked

Spinach ravioli with liguria sauce - BASIL BASIL BASIL! I've never had a pesto sauce more fresh than theirs - we got this dish without chicken to accommodate our vegetarian of the group which was good to know any sauce can be made without meat - all cooked TO ORDER.

"I've been in Vegas for about 3 days.  My hotel in on the heart of the Strip.  Tons of places to eat, tons of places to go.  However, most of those places are crap as far as eating.  I went to Guy Fieri's for dinner and I can't decide which was better, that restaurant or the Denny's down the street.  Finally today, a friend of mine who is living here scooped me up and took me to Lola's.  

Exterior-wise, Lola's is nothing to look at.  It's in a commercial\/industrial complex.  I thought it was a framing store at first.  The interior was a little better, but the Chandelier it ain't.  Very basic but clean decor.  I would call it industrial homestyle.  We got off to a bad start as the hostess asked us if we would be able to eat in about an hour and a fifteen minutes.  I was taken aback by that even though she asked very professionally and courteously.  They were having a private party soon.  The other issue that got us off to a bad start was that in the bathroom were about 4 floaters.  By no means the restaurant's fault, but that's not usually the image you want before you look at the menu.

So I forgot about that (until I started writing this) and glanced at the menu.  Andy was our server..  Andy was interesting because we had an odd back and forth about the difference a half-and-half, an Arnold Palmer, and a monsterade (or something like that).  According to Andy, an Arnold Palmer is unsweetened tea and a lemonade, a monsterade is sweet iced tea mixed with lemonade, and a half-and-half doesn't exist.  As a Baltimorean, this is absurd but I was more hungry than I was argumentative.  Before I begin on the food, I have a disclaimer to make.  I have a bizarre habit of almost never ordering seafood if I'm somewhere inland.  Lola's menu is predominantly seafood because of the Creole faire. I decided to roll the dice and ordered the shrimp and grits.  Here comes another disclaimer; whenever shrimp and grits is on the menu, I order it so that I can compare all of the shrimp and grits I've had.  My friend ordered the soft-shelled crabs.  Our food came out at hyper-speed with a lovely presentation.   My shrimp and grits was good.  In comparison to the other dishes I've had, it was good albeit a bit on the spicy side.  I love spicy, but it seems like the spiciness was masking the lack of other seasonings.  Still delicious though.  My friend DESTROYED his soft-shelled crabs so I assume they too were good.  

So please leave the Strip alone if you want to go eat and get an Uber or Lyft to take you to Lola's.  Good creole food for under $50 AND you're out of there in less than an hour and 15 minutes.",1.0
"I mean.. This pizza wasn't really all that. I would rather have Pizza from Costco. It's cheaper and tastes way better than Grimaldi's. Not to mention, the tables are WAY too small to hold a pizza if you're going with family. The tables probably would only fit two to three people at most with one single pizza. The sauce doesn't really taste like anything, almost as if it's been watered down. The cheese is a little bit rubbery on the pizza, too; not to mention, this is probably one of the most expensive pizzerias out here. The staff also never really listened. I understand that it may be busy, but when you're shouting over your customers and can't even hear a simple drink order, that's when it kind of gets a little uncomfortable.

(+) Chicken sandwiches are tasty! I have tried the Chicken Club and BBQ Chicken Sandwich in the past week and have enjoyed both. 
(+) They have a 2 for $6 promo where you have a choice to mix or match any 2 of the following: Western Bacon Cheeseburger, Famous Star, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, and the                    Carl's Turkey Burger. Not a bad deal! Also the $4 deal with 2 sandwiches, small fries, and a drink all for $4!

(-) as friendly as the employees are, sometimes service can be slow as molasses! Easily my biggest complaint here...and sometimes it happens when there is no signs of any customers around.
(-) while some of the promos are good, the prices are a tad bit pricey if you want to try something not tied in to a promo. $5.69 for a chicken club from a fast food joint? Damn.

The oshizushi (pressed sushi) is quite good. It's dressed a little non-traditionally but I definitely plan to order it again.

Their sides (squid, lobster miso, etc.) are all pretty good. The matcha mille-feuille crepe cake is lovely too.

Be warned, they put wasabi under the fish in nigiri like shops in Japan. Also, a coworker of mine said their rice was falling apart the one time he went. I've never seen that happen so I can't say much about it. 

This shop has become my go-to restaurant when I want good sushi.",1.0
"Just had my daughter's 4th birthday at Pony Party Barnyardville venue and we had a great time!!! Tami was great and super friendly. The ponies were dressed as unicorns and looked fabulous. The kids loved the petting zoo and the animals were very tame and good for all the kids (ages 1-10). The venue had plenty of chairs and tables, coolers and everything you need for a party. All the tables had table clothes and all I had to do was put my food down! Tami and her crew were professional and effortlessly handled a few unruly kids perfectly. I would definitely recommend them to others and use them again in the future!",1.0
Love the food.  The dish I wanted was not on the menu but the chef accommodated our request.,1.0
We made a reservation for ten and were told to wait for twenty minutes on arrival. We were sat and then not attended to for fifteen minutes. We placed our order and three were forgotten to be placed. We were headed to a play so could not wait longer for another order to be placed. No manager came to apologize and nothing was comped. We will not be returning.,1.0
"Well - I tried to make a large party reservation. The hostess said I needed to speak to the manager. A few minutes later the manager got on the phone and said ""he could not do it"" I asked what he could do. The manager said he could only do a parties of 5 reservation. I then suggested that was fine we would break up the group accordingly He indicated that would not work either. I asked if it was a staffing issue. The manager said no. I felt by his tone  he was being bothered rather than being apologetic. Not a good first impression for the new Mentor location. The manager's nearby competitor was happy to accommodate.",1.0
"My son and I found this place the last day here of his visit. We should have found it on the first day, if we had, we would have been back many times. Great food, great prices. Their specialty is seafood, but I am not a big fan of seafood. The did, however, have a chicken burrito and damn it was great !!! My son had fish tacos and he said they were very good. Our server was friendly and helpful, even gave us some coupons to use on the next visit. A great little place with great food. I will be back for sure.",1.0
"Great place for takeout sandwiches!  It's a very small shop\/convenience store that only has one table and seating for two.  I've been here twice and the service is always great and the bahn mi sandwiches are delicious!  They are made with pate, garlic mayo, pickled veggies, red onion and jalapeño peppers.  Amazing value at $3-5 depending on which sandwich you choose.  They also offer some other dishes and hot drinks.",1.0
After visiting this company they placed me on their call rotation and have been calling me non stop. I was then told I had to text a # to have myself to removed when I never asked to be added. I called to speak with a manager who was not professional. I had to block them from my phone. Ridiculous.,1.0

"What can you really say about a grocery store?  This one is a nice, neighborhood grocery store, if not a little frustrating at times.  It was close and convenient to the place I called home for five years, and the employees have always been wonderful and super sweet to me.  From the guy that I always see working in produce that says hi to me every time, to the cashier that goes out of her way to make my son smile, all the way to the baggers who always offer to help me get my groceries out to my car when they see I have my hands full with said wiggly son.

The down sides are that they constantly run out of basics, and their selection of more, ""interesting"" items, can be scarce.  I spent twenty minutes one trip looking for corn starch, and none was to be found in the store.  Asked an employee, who didn't even know where it would be in any of the aisles.  One would think near the baking powders, right?  Nope, not that day at least.  Or the day I wanted to pick up half gallon of chocolate milk, but they were completely out.  Not just of the half gallon, but every single type of chocolate milk.  And then just yesterday I needed a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies.  The Kroger brand was on sale for a $1.00, but did they have it in stock?  Nope, so I had to get the $3.99 name brand bag.  

And then in my quest for ""rare"" items, they have fallen short a few times.  Short ribs?  No, all out.  Water chestnuts?  Again, nope.  Okay, something easier, how about some couscous, the pre-packaged stuff with the seasoning?  Again, no.  They get them in from time to time, or they magically arrive later and are regulars on the shelf, but at the time I looked for them, they were nowhere to be found.

But still, it was my friendly neighborhood grocery store, and I enjoyed shopping there for the most part.  I'm sad that I've moved out of the area and now go to a different store, but they were definitely alright in my book.",1.0
This review is long overdue. I have been to many shops in the valley and now for over a year have been dealing with this shop online.Their  knowledge and selection is abundant . but what keeps me coming back is the excellent excellent customer service. They know their customers and take great care of them. They work as a great team together. I thank you so much for  all you do everyday. You guys rock.,1.0
"I came here for dinner on a Saturday. Even though it was a full house I was seated quickly. My date's steak came out pretty rare, when he ordered it so it was sent back. The second time it came out, the middle was still pretty medium rare. HOWEVER, the manager was extremely pleasant & very accommodating. He comp-d our whole entire meal. I have never experienced such generosity at any restaurant I've ever been to. Yes, usually a discount, or a drink is taken off the bill which is what I normally would expect, but 2 salads, my veal parmesan, and his steak were taken off. He also had a complimentary salad to go. What a great businessman ! I'm definitely coming back, and recommending this place to my friends as well. The veal was cooked perfectly ! Perfect amount of breading as well as a generous amount of cheese. PHENOMENAL service too ! Bravo :)",1.0
"Echo has always been my go-to for 2 things: coffee and a great study atmosphere. The coffee is such an awesome quality that I can taste it with every sip. I truly have never tried something I don't like - although I normally stick to lattes. As far as the atmosphere, the place gives off an incredible ambiance and makes me feel inclined to study. Although it's not always quiet, it somehow works so well for me. Maybe the coffee has a crazy ingredient ;). 

So why 4 stars? The staff. Don't get me wrong, they are barista wizards. They know how to make coffee and make it well. But, wow. Could they hate people more? They always give off a vibe that they 1) don't want to be there and 2) don't want you to be there either. I'm a regular enough to notice some do this more than others (there's a young, tall guy that is always super friendly!). 

Anyways- other than a lack of feeling genuine hospitality from some staff, you should go here. Everything else will outweigh that one negative. Cheers to good coffee.",1.0
"This place is well taken care of and the staff are friendly.  I have both bought and sold here a few times.  There are some awesome hair bows you can buy at the front.

I will definitely be a regular here!",1.0
"I seem to think that at lunch time during the week is the best time to get food here. I've ordered at night at various times like 5, 6, 7pm and the food is decent but when I come and order at lunch time it's better, fresher and tastier. Maybe it's who's cooking at these times. They have the usual chinese food items we are all accustomed to; ie sweet & sour pork, chicken balls, fried rice etc.; & some limited specialities that you would see at dim sum.  
Overall I like the food and there's a small eat in area with about 6 tables each holding 4-5 people. Casual fast food.",1.0
Coming out to Vegas I was looking forward to visiting the one and only King's in the state of Nevada. Their remodel is awesome! Looks nicer than all the other ones.

I like this place. It isn't like a regular Hampton Inn.  In fact I didn't even realize it was a Hampton Inn till the next morning. It has a luxurious feel to it.  The room were clean and they or is on the bottom for with a walk out enclosed balcony. Breakfast is included in the stay.  But the hotel is nestled in a sea of great  restaurants and shopping boutiques. Great experience here.,1.0
"Kwan carries showy dim sum shaped in bunnies, piglets and porcupines. The prices are pretty on par with typical dim sum and you order by checking items off of a list. I would say the food is more westernised\/fusion (not too traditional) so if you're looking for an authentic experience, you won't get one from here but if you love gimmick (like me) and cutely shaped food, Kwan is the place for you.

4 stars because a dim sum restaurant can never get the full 5 stars unless there is cart service (that's the real deal).",1.0
"Went in on a Saturday evening WITH a reservation. Waited at the bar for at least a half an hour (not a problem) had some champagne while waiting for our table. This was our first visit, we tend to like T-Bones, SW Steakhouse, Prime....but since we recently moved into One Queensridge, we decided to support our neighbors. Well what a disaster! We were led upstairs and sat at the most embarrassing ""bistro"" type table that was not only unstable but was meant for either children or the smallest humans on earth. I can't imagine spending several hundred dollars on a bottle of wine and at least that much on dinner just to sit at a pathetic cafeteria style tin table. For such a pricey restaurant one would think they would invest in better seating for their high paying customers. Needless to say, we declined to stay, told them no thank you and we wouldn't be back. We had better service and were very comfortable at Brio. Don't waste your money here, drive up the street to the awesome T-Bones...you'll thank me!",1.0

I have not been able to find anywhere else that has a cheaper breakfast menu and their portion sizes are great as well.  Would I come here deliberately again...probably not.

"I advise against taking out at this Olive Garden. The customer service is not good and they take a very long time to get you your order. 
I ordered on my way from work a meal for my yesterday. I arrive 40 minutes after placing the order and no one, not even a host, was at the front desk. There were other people waiting as well for someone to greet them or take their order. 
We waited for about 6 minutes until one of the other customers went in the kitchen, where most of the employees were talking and eating at the time, to request service. Then three gentlemen came out to take care of us. 
One of the gentlemen told me my order was ready and went to the back to get it. 10 minutes later...he had not returned. I'm utterly confused because now it's been over 55minutes since I placed my order and it took long for him to return with my food. 
I left out because I was disgusted with the customer service. Before completely pulling off a worker came to my car and said my food was ready. Of course I expressed my disappointment in their service and told him I would not be paying so unless I'm getting the food free I do not want it. He said he would ask his manager when he went back inside. I pulled off after 5 minutes of waiting and went to chic fil a across the street because they have impeccable customer service. 
Do NOT go to this restaurant",1.0
Under staff. Noe ones here to serve you. They dont have breakfast or brunch on a sunday 1pm. The lady in the kitchen is asian and not familiar with Turkish dishes or even the food they serve. The Turkish coffee tastes good but the tea set is not much appropriate for a hot beverage like this one. Over priced and under service. I also ordered a spinach borek which she put it in the microwave and killed all the crunchiness. The place look nice but not worth driving here or even bringing anyone special.,1.0

"I use to hangout at Chicago rooftops day or night often in Chicago. Excited to hear that there was something similar here in Phoenix- I've been eager to check out Lustre. Almost a year went by and I was finally able to go Lustre  a couple weeks ago.  My friends and I had gone around 3-4 pm on a Sunday afternoon. We grabbed some food and hungout for about an hour. I had chicken sliders with chips which was good. I was really excited to see that they carry Effin liquor which is hard to find out here in Phoenix. The views from the building are pretty.
Overall, I was a bit disappointed. My friends were not really impressed with their food. I felt like that the atmosphere could've been more up beat. I would like to try coming on am evening and giving this spot a second chance.",1.0
"I was surprised by how good this place was, in all honesty. My friend and I dropped in for lunch today, and we were definitely not expecting it to be of this quality for only about ten dollars each person! That being said, despite how it calls itself a seafood buffet, most of their food isn't necessarily seafood, and their sushi selection was decent but very limited. Also, as a side note, all of their stuffed items (mussels, clams, crabs, mushrooms, etc) were filled with a stuffing that in my opinion had way too much onion. However, overall I enjoyed the food, and definitely would come back again.",1.0

However, that is because EVERY plate is made to order. It's worth it! Trust me. I'm a chef and I hate breakfast. Breakfast to lunch, you will not be disappointed with the execution of your food. I STRONGLY recommend getting one of their seasonal muffins. To die for! I usually get a half of all three. Pumpkin, chocolate and blueberry. Not to mention Amber! The ""food whisperer"".

"Don't be fooled by the blue sterilization bags! I went in last night with my mom for 2 manicures. First of all the lady who did my manicure didn't even greet me, she just stood there near her chair staring out the window and I just ended up going over to sit down. Not even a Hello, how are you? So she brings out a little tray with a blue sterilization bag for the metal instruments they use along with a square pink buffer and a file. The buffer looked un-used, however, not the file. When she went to open the blue sterilization bag, it was barely sealed! I've worked in a surgery center and when instruments are sealed properly and sanitized, the bag gets a yellowish hue once its properly sterilized in the autoclave. And you have to rip it open, which makes it unusable a second time. You can tell the bag was used before because it was barely closed. This lady opens the bag and folds it in half and puts it back on the tray. After my manicure I watched her from the nail drying station get ready for another client and use the same freakin bag!

"The only thing that's keeping this review from being a 1 star is because their food is actually delicious. The service at this location is alway slow, and they never offer you anything to drink until 5 minutes after you already had sat down.

The servers give you a dirty look when you order their lunch boxes, like you've done some high wrong. I'm one person, I can't eat a lot! If they don't like people ordering lunch sizes, then don't offer it on the menu! So as for the bento choices, you can also order a bento box with one meat choice, or one meat choice with tempura. I've realized Within a couple of minutes from ordering that I forgot to say I would like tempura with my bento box, the server insisted that she was now going to charge me full price for the tempura now. Really? Why? Cause you don't know how to put the same portion of tempura to cook like you would of had when I ordered it the first time?

I started with the chawanmushi appetizer, which I enjoyed. My guy opted for the cold soba noodle meal and was disappointed by the quality and flavor. Perhaps going the route with added tempura would have been a better choice. I'm not much of a fan in the first place, so I opted for a chirashi. Meal was beautiful and fairly priced at $15 including soup and salad, but some of the fish used was less than fresh and the spicy tuna seemed downright old.

Growing up in Hawaii, I'm used to eating traditional Hawaiian-style poke - most of the time, it's usually no more than 4 ingredients - and it's already delicious because it's not masked by 20 different toppings. As such, I opted for the unagi bowl.

I'm happy I took this route. Everything about this bowl was great. The ingredients worked well together; salty from the unagi sauce (albeit a bit too much was drizzled) and sweet from the tamago (sweet egg). There's a nice variety of texture as well (masago, fresh sprouts, unagi). Topped with a bowl of miso soup, it was quite a satisfying meal.",1.0

"Decided to go because of a groupon, and regretted it. 

First off, the first waitress we had took the wrong order for our appetizer and we got the poutine instead of the shrimp, which we decided to just try the poutine instead. It was very salty with an overwhelming amount of cheese. Overall it did not fit our taste.
Next, we got our main dishes. The drunken noodles were not bad. The flavor was pretty good, but bunch of the noodles were not completely cooked. The Korean chicken was dry and tough. The sides of the chicken were like jerky. The ganjang sauce had an odd flavor and did not suit my taste at all. The kimchi I got as a side tasted like basically large pieces of ginger. The two stars are for the second waitress who was very kind.

The problem is the service.  I came in and waited for about 10 minutes and there was no one to be found.  There was no bell or anyway of announcing my presence.  Finally I had to make noise and then this girl with no personality came out and asked how long I had been waiting, I told her and she was like ok I need to figure out what is wrong with the door because it has a sensor that should let me know when someone opens the door.   I really don't care about the technical difficulties you are having when I didn't even get an apology.  That may have made a difference.  But really, what is she doing here by herself anyway. 

My sandwich on this occasion was still good but the smoothie was soupy.

I had purchased both the small and medium, and when I got to work and opened up the small there was only two thin slices of chicken, so I opened the medium and it had only four thinly sliced chicken. Both weighing less than four ounces of protein... I was a bit disappointed and kinda bummed there was way more squash and zucchini than the meat itself. I wish I would've known! 

Fortunately I did use a 20% discount so I didn't pay the full price, but I am a bit bummed I was misinformed. And in no way do I want any of those gals to get in trouble for this post, I just thought sharing my thoughts would hopefully guide employees to better inform customers about how many ounces or slices of chicken\/protein is in the meals. 

Three stars because of how good the food was. I did absolutely enjoyed both meals, it just wasn't meeting my expectations for the price.",1.0
"Loved the meal, hated the atmosphere. I've been to Z'Tejas before and while I miss the Voodoo tuna terribly, I had my go-to alternate choice - the ruby trout salad. That was after the scrumptious shrimp tostada bites (grilled shrimp on top of avocado on top of a tostada) and a decent, though not extraordinary tortilla soup. I particularly liked the fact that Z'Tejas doesn't scrimp on the trout.

What really made the meal challenging, though, were the screaming kids. Not just one or two, but wherever you looked in the restaurant. True, we ate around 6:30pm on a Saturday, and that was well before the wee ones' bedtimes, but still.... Perhaps the hostess interspersed those with young kids among the quieter diners to balance out the noise level to an even roar throughout the restaurant, but to those who just wanted to have a nice meal and talk, it was more than a bit distracting, annoying, and uncomfortable. Look, I get the fact that Z'Tejas wants to be family friendly, but not everyone thinks a person's kid exercising his developing lungs is special - at least not in a good way.

Here's a radical suggestion. No, I'm not going to suggest barring kids from the restaurant. That would be wrong for the type of restaurant and would subject Z'Tejas to social media flaming. Rather, might I propose that people with kids under 12 be escorted to a section of the restaurant with other kids under 12, preferably where the noise level will be tolerable elsewhere in the establishment? For parents who object, feeling that they ought to be able to be around people who are quieter than they are, so as not to encourage their kids to scream any louder, that's just rude. You made your McDonald's Playland, now lie in it. We are not your siblings, parents, or grandparents. We do not necessarily think all of your kids' antics are adorable, nor do we feel we owe you some special consideration because you chose to have kids with you. We just want to have a nice meal with a reasonable noise level.

Okay, go ahead. Tell me why it is sooooo horrible for me to buy a meal without sustaining hearing loss or why I should think it precious that when you leave your table, it takes a crime scene cleanup crew to pull food, drink, crayons, and other debris off of tables, chairs and carpet (and we can't avoid seeing the disgusting mess or being jostled by the clean team).

Look. You're proud of your kids and\/or you want to socialize them. Understood. But can't the restaurant serve one demographic without destroying another's evening?",1.0
"Crazy to see all of the bad reviews on here...
I frequent this location as it is close to work and I honestly have never had any problems. During the rush hour of lunch, sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but nothing excessive & is to be expected. I did encounter the ""owner"" others speak of a couple of times, and he was indeed very rude.
Other than that, the food is great, smoothies even better, and staff are very friendly. Will continue to visit :)",1.0

We visit this zoo number times a year and still find something new to see every time. The newest thing is the tiger exhibit. It's truly amazing. Very large and really nice. There is even a spot to stand under them while they cross a bridge. The tigers are currently getting acclimated to the environment so if you really want to see them wait a few weeks. It will be amazing! The other new thing is a 4d theater. We loved it! It's a must for sure.,1.0
"We are on the hunt for the BEST BURGER in Toronto! Stop #1: Holy Chuck

Holy Chuck is a small, but lively burger spot. The casual as F decor is close to my heart, highlighted by the stack of buns that they've stored next to the door. (No sarcasm, I actually appreciate the the look.) It's not overly large though, so think twice about bringing more than a handful of friends.

On to the food! By popular suggestion I opted for the Mad Cow. To say the least, this sandwich was special. It's a combo of their Animal Feed burger and a Jr. cheeseburger. (Animal Feed: panko crusted portobello mushroom stuffed with feta & cream cheese, deep fried then topped with lettuce, tomato & lemon herb aioli) When you first bite into this sizeable mouthful you'll get hit with such a variety of flavours that you'll have to step back and do a double take. On subsequent bites you'll find that the aioli and oh so creamy cream cheese take a warm hold of the show. Eventually you'll discover the panko crusted portobello mushroom, at which point you realize how the Animal Feed burger holds up without the Jr. cheeseburger. And oh ya, there's a cheeseburger in there.

I also snagged the Fudge, Sea Salt & Fresh Red Chili Shake. You're likely thinking ""sea salt and red chili!?"". Trust me; reserve your judgement until you try it. The standard fudge shake flavour is great, but then after 10 seconds of wondering where the red chili comes in, it hits you with authority. To be honest I was a little offended, but not necessarily in a bad way. Think laid back sensual times with a significant other, then out of no where they slap you across the face. You're annoyed, maybe a little angry for a second, then... you're sort of into it. Not an everyday thing, but a sometimes thing.

I use Red Carpet VIP 2 years ago.  I found their service is pretty wonderful.  Once you call they will ask which weekend you will be headed to Vegas.  Within a hour they will text you a list of clubs and pricing they charge.  Once you pay on the day of clubbing one of their staff will text you and introduce themselves.  At that time you can let he\/she know when you want to meet so he\/she can walk you in the club.  I found the service very wonderful and stress free.  We save a lot of times.  I will sure use them again for our next party in Vegas,1.0

It's amazing how encouraging they are to get eaters out of their comfort zone by just offering up free tastes. I've had flavors that included Roasted Red Bell Pepper, Fois Gras, Chili Popcorn, Gorgonzola, and many more that I would have never even thought of in dessert period, let alone in gelato. It's such a treat to have this place in our valley.

"It took the four of us a long time to make up our minds because the titles of the sandwiches were so fun we had to read the entire menu!   But when the server told us Flancers makes its own bread, it was sandwiches all around.  

I had the prickly pear marinated chicken breast sandwich with green chili mayo and a side of sweet potato fries.  But I wish I had tried the green chili mac&cheese.

"Expensive and not worth the price. They got one sandwich wrong (costing us an extra $1 because they added something not ordered on it) The fries are terrible and appear to have a coating on them and you get maybe 10 fries. The chicken breast is very small. None of the food was really hot-warm at best. This meal cost us $25 for 2 people and that was with a special they were offering.

We won't be back and can't recommend that others go. Your chicken sandwich is not a full breast, it's a cutlet that is small and not worth $7.50. Fries for $2.95 when you get so few and in reality don't seem to go with the 'theme' of organic since they appear to be coated with something. The burger also appeared to be a very small portion for $6.99. The food is not good enough to warrant those prices. Plus $2 to add bacon when you get 2 very thin strips bacon. The cheese slices are also so thin you can't even taste the cheese. You may have a good concept with the organic meats and veggies but the product (size) does not warrant the price you're charging.",1.0

Each roll was cut into 4 tiny pieces and they were poorly put together. My rolls were falling apart as I was picking them up. Also, it would be nice if they had a description of each roll. If I had known that our spicy rolls were drenched in mayo, then I would've requested no sauce.

Too many websites needed me to email them to request a quote  but I was in too much of a rush to wait to hear back. I did see terrible reviews but with the price and availability to get my order to me when i needed it i decided to take the chance.. I started with the 2 day shipping that would get me the booklets the day before i needed them. However I made an error and did not bleed the page out far enough, creating a white border. So my job was delayed. I could not fix the file imidiately because I had left home, so i emailed their customer service asking if they could just zoom the file or print as is. With no response by the time i was off work later that night, i just fixed the file which took it off hold. Their website is incredibly easy to use an follow.

1) It was hotter than Hades today so it might be nice to host it later in the fall or at least later in the day!

2) It would be incredibly helpful if the Festival provided a map of the grounds or at least listed all of the attending Food Trucks and provided a description of each. 

3) Not many trucks had a $4 option as promised in the Festival description. We want to try and taste as much as possible but that's not as easy to do with the full portions being served plus it would be nice to have the option of cheaper portions. 

4) We wish they had offered the VIP option without the shirt from the very beginning however the $25 VIP ticket was definitely worth it just for the shade tent.

"We've been here twice now. The first time was right after they opened for their late-night happy hour. Things here across the board were very hit or miss. The philly, pork belly, and short rib steam buns were all disappointing but the kung pao chicken was okay. The pork belly ramen was actually delicious but the best part of any ramen is the broth, and this had maybe three spoonfuls of broth - it was almost more of just a sauce. The cocktails are really strange here too - they have way too many ""trendy"" ingredients that just don't work well together. Overall, my impression of the food and drink is that the prices for the happy hour specials were reasonable but their full price menu items are way overpriced for what you get. Service was also strangely inconsistent - the server just completely ignored me when it came time to ask for drink orders, but took orders from the rest of my companions. I had to flag her down later and ask to order a drink.

Or second visit was tonight, also for late nite happy hour. I was hoping they had ironed out the opening night glitches we experienced when we went the last time, but not so much.

I wasn't buried in my phone or anything either, just chatting with my companions. After that happened, I opted not to bother with a drink this time.

I think they are very affordable options, as no matter what you choose, the girls will help you, and you will get tan in any bed, and you can stop in any location that is close to you.
Make this your permanent salon!! I've never been happier or more proud of my results. When you have a package, you also get 20% off any lotions (they have a great selection). I don't review many places, as I am very picky and only satisfied with the best, but give Celebrity your business and you won't regret it!! 
Lastly, they are open until 10 Pm Monday-Fri and I think until 7 pm on the weekends; making it very flexible for people like me who go to school and work full time!
Thank you Celebrity tanning for being so knowledgable, adorable, and making me very tan!",1.0

"Although I love their outdoor patio, I've got to give 2 stars. There are disgusting filters sitting in a planter on the patio, which makes me wonder how filthy their kitchen must be. 

Fun for brunch, especially if you like your eggs with a Bloody Mary or mimosa. Very few gluten-free breakfast options so I've gotten the breakfast burrito bowl a couple of times. It's just okay - not enough pico de gallo or guacamole & this time it was served luke warm, as was my daughter's French toast. My daughter did not like her dish at all & only ate two bites. We told the server this but she did not take it off the bill. 

Dinner here is decent - my husband loved his spicy surf and turf. Salads are tasty.

I bought a groupon deal for six laser treatments. I've only had five and they told me I've used all six. I had burn marks on my arms which is not normal at all. I get laser on my entire body and never had that happen once at the other place I go to.  

Overall experience within the last 5 months or so of service was awful. 

Also one of the estheticians did my laser on my arms so half ass it literally took her one minute. She didn't take her time. She quickly went over my arm with the laser as fast as she could and said we were done. Without even getting my entire arm. 

I also paid for a FULL ARM of laser, I told them only the lower half with my hand included. The first three times they did it no problem, then the 4th time she didn't, the 5th I had to remind her and she told me I didn't pay for that and it only says lower arm on my file. 

On my 3rd apt or so I called and requested a certain girl to do my laser for my 4th apt and I would of been flexible with my schedule on the day and time but she said she couldn't do that. It's whoever is available that day and they don't have their schedules to be able to do that. 

After calling and complaining and being upset about having burn marks the front desk girl said its normal then hung up in my ear or the phone call dropped but she didn't call me back. I'd at least expect that from a place trying to keep somebody's business.",1.0
"This was my first time at Woodie's and will be my last time going there. I needed a routine oil change and decided to go with Woodie's since it was right around the corner from my work. As I walked into the building, I was never greeted by Jo Jo as I walked to his desk. When I got to the desk, Jo Jo never even looked up at me to acknowledge a paying customer is in the building. I finally spoke and said I wanted to get an oil change on my vehicle. After we settled that situation, I was able to get a ride to my work from their shuttle. I got a call from An employee who wanted to update me on my car a few hours later. We went over some minor details and I was responded back to him ""since it's minor things, I'll let my good friend who is a mechanic look at it and he can help me out going forward"". The employee then stated ""well maybe you should let him take care of your needs in the future"". I dropped my car off for an oil change and that's what I expected to happen. If I don't need your help with anything else, please don't be tell me I don't need to give you business if I have my own mechanic. I thought that was pretty rude and this place is seriously lacking customer service. The only thing that was great about this experience was the shuttle driver Kelly. She was nice and pleasant and got me to my job in a timely and safe manner. I will not be bringing my business back to Woodie's and will let my mechanic handle all of my work from now on since that's what this company wants me to do.",1.0

"And my 200th Yelp review goes to......................  Lash Out!

After having extensions put on for a special occasion I waited for them to naturally fall off due to lash shedding.  I waited.  And waited.  And waited.  Finally, after having them on for a Month (!) I contacted Lash Out to schedule a removal.  The front desk was very concerned about why I wanted them to be removed and was amazed when I told her how long they had been hanging on.

I previously had gone to the Scottsdale location but the Ahwatukee one is closer to my home and is now my new favorite.  Everyone there was so much fun, I want to come hang out with them on my day off!  The receptionist was very friendly and couldn't believe how long they lasted.  My lash tech, Sharon, brought me back to the application area and briefed me on what exactly she would do to remove the lashes.  She applied a gel to dissolve the adhesive and we waited.  She checked to make sure I was comfortable through it all and was very personable.

Because I am a current client of Lash Out, the removal was free of charge and took around 30 min from arrival to departure.  Everyone there was super friendly and fun.  Seriously, Lash Out Ahwatukee , can I come hang out on my day off?",1.0

"My wife and I walked into this location last night to look for a bed and a couch. We were in complete awe over the place. We walked in and were greeted by a lady who had asked us if we had ever been to Living Spaces before and proceeded to inform us that none of their employees are paid on commission. (Reverse sales psychology to assure us that we weren't feeling pressured to buy) Which I thought was funny because both my wife and I have been in sales for 10 years, but that's beside the point. Not even 5 minutes in the store and we are approached by a ""Customer Service Rep"" aka a Sales Associate. My wife and I immediately picked up on her reverse sales tactics. She was casually following us around the store, going out of her way to oversell us on different pieces of furniture (Didn't bother to ask us if we were looking for anything in particular) She thought she was being casual with her ""Non Profitable"" approach, but in reality my wife and I felt extremely pressured and a bit uncomfortable as we were trying to pick out furniture together that suited us. After a few minutes of her providing us with random facts about furniture that we were not interested in, she went about her day. We continued looking around the store for a total of about 6 minutes before we were approached again by the same lady. At this point we were extremely annoyed, however we decided to give her the benefit of the doubt, so we continued listening to her tell us about the furniture. We actually came across a bed and dresser set that we REALLY liked. Of course she told us it was her favorite piece of furniture in the store and gave us some information about the manufacturer. We asked her if she could give us a price for the two pieces of furniture including the delivery charges. At this point, my wife and I noticed that she had a little extra pep in her step and was overly excited for us (herself) While she was calculating a total cost my wife had politely let her know that we would not be purchasing the furniture right then and there because we didn't get paid until midnight... From there, the lady's entire demeanor changed and she almost seemed frustrated with us.   Suddenly she was not helpful and friendly anymore. (Odd considering she's ""not paid on commission"") She was very short with us replying with simple ""Yes"" and ""No"" answers to our questions. My wife picked up on her bitter attitude towards us very quickly. If it wasn't for this experience we would have purchased both pieces of furniture today. When I got home last night I decided to do a little research to find out if Living Spaces employees are in fact ""Not paid on commission"" I quickly discovered that they claim to be a ""Commission Free"" organization, yet they are required to meet certain quotas per month, in which THEY DO make bonuses off of.......? So in other words, they're paid on commission lol. This came as no surprise to us as the lady's change in attitude was a dead giveaway, but the fact that they claim to be commission free instead of just having honest sales associates, prevented us from buying. Had the lady who greeted us not mentioned that the Staff was not paid on commission, the experience would have been completely different because we would have been prepared to listen to a sales associate, like every other normal furniture store in America. But the fact that they go out of their way to lie to their customers, says a lot about their company. We will not be returning to Living Spaces nor will we ever recommend them to any of our friends or family.",1.0

The reason I will never go again is the owner.  Twice we have been to the restaurant and he has been loud, obnoxious, and drunk.  The first time happened several years ago on Christmas Day.  He cursed loudly, dropped the f bomb many times however I thought well it's Christmas so maybe he was celebrating early.  The next time happened about two months ago.  I brought my three year old and my husband there for lunch.  The owner came into the restaurant and started cursing loudly.  I was so upset I walked up to him and asked him to stop.  The wait staff thanked me for saying something.  I will never go to Tao garden again.",1.0
"The Real Housewives of Anthem were definitely in full force on a recent Saturday evening and who could blame them?  With the nice décor, cool bar and tasty cocktail list, coming in with blow out and a fresh manicure for a glass or 3 of ""Man Candy"" (actual name of cocktail, not from an actual cock) makes for a solid call.

I like the concept, but there were enough items that didn't shine.  It's a little unfair comparing this to Simon's Carson Kitchen, but with both being equidistant from home, the downtown counterpart is a clear notch above.  It wasn't like dinner was a total loss as there were a couple of quality items. 

Loved:

Whole Smoked Romanesco: It may look like something from outer space or a gremlin's head, but it was fantastic.  This love child of broccoli and cauliflower topped with the zesty capers, raisins and red onion made for an amazing vegetable dish. 

Date & Bleu Cheese Jam: The sweet and tart dates combined with buttered almond spread over delicious bacon bread tasted like a luxurious peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I could chow on all day long.  I enjoyed the subtlety of the bleu cheese which added a nice little twist to all the other flavors going on.  More bread was ordered to finish and it was the best thing we ate.

Didn't love:

Spicy Shrimp: $20 for 8 pieces of shrimp in a below average Thai curry.  The bread was a waste.  This doesn't belong on the menu.

Crispy Oysters:  I love raw oysters.  I even like deep fried oysters.  But breaded, fried and then served cold?  Absolutely not.  Sure, it looks pretty in pictures, but the texture and taste were not desirable.  We even debated whether to finish the last two on the plate, but the principle of paying and thinking about all those starving children in Africa cajoled us into seeing it through.  Give it to me raw.

Tongue & Cheek Agnolotti:  It was surprising just how much peppercorn sauce the relatively good pasta was drowning in and the rich-on-rich flavor did not jive with me.  Photos I saw online had much less.  What happened?  It could have been a stand out!

Snails Wellington: Bardot does it better.

Mandatory valet:  Bullshit.  Last I checked, this was Henderson and NOT West Hollywood.  I have to tip a kid to drive my car less than 50 yards away?  Fuck that.

Food wise, my partner and I tried the banh mi and the burger from Provision.  The burger was solid, cooked well, but pretty basic. It wasn't anything to write home about. The banh mi had nice flavors, but I was not into the chicken skin concept. I wanted to give it a try, because I actually really enjoy crispy, well-seasoned chicken skin (you know, with my chicken meat). The chicken skin that was on this banh mi was too crunchy and soaked with oil ... it tasted like it had been re-fried with oil. The oil flavor was just too intense, and in my opinion there was simply too much of the skin. I feel like regular shredded chicken or pork would have been great with the rest of the flavors of the banh mi.  I'm not weighting the specific experience we had with Provision too heavily towards this rating, though, since it's only one of the four restaurants being incubated, and the selection of restaurants will rotate.

"Moen customer support and service is second to none. My iODigital valve body went south after 4 years and they overnighted me a new one. This is an expensive item, but no charge! They understand their business success is dependent on new sales for remodels, new construction, etc. and the way to own that market is through word of mouth from owners and professionals. Notice how many reviews say they ""are customers for life"" because of their support and service? - bingo.

The worst part of this experience was that her small child spent the entire time crawling all over us.  I get that childcare is very expensive, and folks have their kids at their businesses all the time.  The difference is that the kids are corralled and have things to occupy them besides bugging your customers.  The kid was cute, but holy crap.  She was trying to crawl on me while her mom was doing my eyebrows.  My husband had to resort to showing her videos of our cat on his phone to get her off me.  Mom had zero control of the situation.

You could see in to the kitchen that the waiters were standing around and talking about the escapades from the night before instead of waiting tables around them.

My father ordered steak and eggs which was  a 10 ounce sirloin that was supposed to be medium rare it  turned out to be well done and charred, the waiter asked to get him a new steak, but it never came.  the toast that came with it was sourdough and burnt as well as the  O'Brien potatoes those were pretty crispy luckily leave my father likes it that way.

"When our garage door opener started to have major problems, I was apprehensive about calling for repairs, based on the many complaints about garage door contractors in this area.  After researching options at major home supply stores and reviews of contractors on the internet, I called American Veteran Garage Door based on the quality of that company's yelp ratings.  

Mike arrived at the scheduled time.  After examining the problem, he gave me a range of options, all of which I knew to be reasonable based on my research.

"There's been a lot of hype around this place, so I've been meaning to check it out for some time.  When I got there, there was a huge lineup wrapped around the inside, and the interior allows access to La Carnita, which is handy as it gives you some standing room while you eat your soft serve.

After a not too long wait, I had a Campfire S'mores cone in my hands, and found it in a ridiculously large size.  I took a spoon and attacked this cone starting at the top, and as we spent the next hour or so digging into our cones, we barely made a dent in it.  

The outside is indeed delicious with chocolate and marshmallows on the outside, but we noticed that the soft serve was rather flavourless on the inside, with one friend finding the inside of the cone empty.  A word of advice though: do not try to finish the whole thing if it's late in the day, and you'll be in a sugar rush for the next few hours if you do.  I tossed my cone after finishing all the toppings, and I still felt quite full afterwards.

"Ba Ba Ba BarBeQue is all I can say...
Being a NON PORK eater from the North it's no wonder why we never been here.
Our daughter Godparents who are very fond of the pig, came down for a visit and really wanted BBQ. We've lived here for about 4 years now and had never been out for BBQ so I looked to Yelp & Low and Behold this place popped up with reviews from some of my fellow Elite who I trust.

It was a rainy day when we checked this place out and as we ran to the door to enter people who were exiting looked Happy and FULL & begin to tell us ""Best Choice Ever"". Our guest were excited and asked a couple questions to the patrons. We were say in the back corner booth for our party of 6. 

My husband and I ordered the seafood fried with the squash. The squash was not as good as I read it to be, it had flavor with a lot of oil. The seafood was Meh ( I guess that's why it's a BBQ house not a seafood house ). Our guest on the other hand had Ba Ba Ba BarBeQue and they LOVED IT.

"THIS PLACE IS UNACCEPTABLE!!! The way they deal with basic guest service is to pretend not to know n rather not deal with it. I checked in the pet friendly floor with my 4 months old toy poodle puppy. He just completed all his shots n has never been in public places before. I carried him throughout the whole way to the room. TWO hours later he started scratching like crazy and we called the front desk due to fleas, even I got bitten by fleas!! what they can say is ""here's the phone number to the vet, give them a call"".  In busy traffic and high price, we had to take our baby to emergency! 
We contacted the so called manager and what we got back was ""we need our ego lab to get back the result from examining the room"". 
I spoke to a representative later on after I got back home n they dare to send a letter back to say they found nothing so what the fuck do u want to do?!
They have fuckin fleas in the room!!!
So very disappointed and furious if they even care about their guests!!

This weekend, my family went to the restaurant to try eat-in. As many other people on Yelp have already alluded to, service is lacking and the waitress were, I hate to say it, but downright rude.

A new management company took over two weeks ago and the atmosphere has changed completely. It is difficult to get s live person on the phone. Maintenance is slow with repairs. The pool is filthy! The dog poop receptacles are overflowing. Lights are out all over the walkways. We just found out today that we have to sign a contract  and ""rent"" the clubhouse at $150\/hour. 

We have a small two bedroom, upstairs unit. We pay $300+\/month for air conditioning. That is keeping the thermostat at 80 degrees. 

They also require a 60 day notice if you are moving, regardless if your lease is up. If you are forced to go month to month because of this policy, you will pay an extra $200\/month. 

Don't live here! There are plenty of other places to live in the area. The housing market is very competitive and I foresee Sonoran Vista being vacant and bankrupt in two years. 

Update to respond to Kayla's response: 
On 8\/28\/2016, two other residents and myself were informed by Cherrie that we would need to sign a contract and rent the clubhouse for $150\/hour. She was rude and condescending.

"I have definitely been to a lot of local pizza places in strip mall like areas wherever I get to travel. The Sweet Basil Neapolitan Style Pizzeria definitely stands out to occupy a special place in my mind.

More than the pizzas or food itself, you cannot miss their gigantic wooden chair near the entrance.  I thought it to be a pretty cool and attractive stuff. I of course, did manage to sit on it and have a couple of snaps taken by my friends. Should be a fun thing to do for the kids - other than the eating itself.

The inner layout of the store was pretty neat. One side tucked away with the kitchen and counter area and a sprawling dining space for the rest.  A good chunk of the seating was for a minimum of 4 people and the fact that the seating area was large - with tall seats also being available clearly indicated they are as much a dine-in family place as they are a take out.

The noise level of the place was slightly less than the average. Do not be surprised at songs that are a 10 year old being played out for you to recall.

Alright, moving onto the real main item - the pizza. This is the first place where the thin crust was not so thin that it felt as if you were just eating cheese and toppings. We had a thin crust margarita pizza. The tomatoes were evidently freshly cut ones and placed POST the baking of the cheese with basil and other herbs, leaving it with a unique taste of the raw and cooked at the same time. Every slice was truly an out of the world taste, when downed with the ample oregano, grated cheese and chilli flakes at the table.

While waiting on your pizzas, if you will, you can go a little backdoor and there is a whole play area out there. There were some pretty older DOS based games if you will, on the play terminals setup there. Standard stuff. But definitely looked pretty overused and requiring some make over as well.",1.0
"Terrible place. I always tipped well until one day they completely messed up my car without taking any accountability. The person (Hispanic female) who was wiping down my interior,  that seemed disgruntled by the way, broke the bracket on my rear driver side seat compartment.

I got there just in time. Sue, the owner greeted me with a warm smile and gorgeous blonde dimensions in her hair. The energy in Elements waiting area can not be bought. The energy there is so real and forceful that you want to sit and breathe positive vibrations as you wait for your therapist. 
Aaahh, Mia...she welcomed me with this blessed energy that she applied to my body along with lemongrass lotion. I told her the energy I needed to remove and her unique blend of Reiki and Massage did just that.

"Been here a few times to get some food. It's an ok place to eat occassionally and their prices might be a bit more expensive than some other asian\/chinese cafes\/restaurants but its bearable. Maybe a couple dollars more? They do offer some combos but that only really means you get a hot drink along with your meal. Getting a cold drink means an additional fee of 50 cents or so.

Food quality is actually not bad. I've tried their baked clams, cheese and mushroom rice\/spaghetti dish which was quite good and tasty. I've also had a few of their Yunnan Vermicelli varieties like the shredded pork with preserved vegetables, fish fillet in fish broth and fish fillet in spicy fish broth; all of which I found quite tasty as well. The serving size is a good portion too so it definitely fills!

Serivce has been decent so far but I prefer coming during the day time because the servers seem to care more. Well, they were females...no offense guys! When I came during the day for either take out or eating in, service was fine. I came one time in the evening and was served by a guy who forgot to give me a menu. I also got the vibe that they didn't want me there as they were going to be closed in an HOUR...you really can't take one more customer? And I finished eating in HALF AN HOUR TOO! I'm not that inconsiderate now ;P

In any case overall it's not a bad place to grab a bite if you are in the area. Would I say it's the greatest? No...the worst? Nah. There's nothing super special about this place but it's not so bad that you need to avoid it. :)",1.0

Went on Saturday 3-19-16 at about 7pm cuz' we had a sweet tooth.  This restaurant is located on Spring Mountain & Decatur in the same shopping center as Big Wong, Curry Zen, Kung Fu Tea, Monta Ramen, etc.  $34.82 got us two desserts and a coffee.  Pretty steep for desserts but they are fancy-schmancy and the ladies make them right in front of you. 

The experience is five stars.  The place is clean, ultra modern, and the people who work there were just bending over backwards to make us happy.  I brought in a couple of drinks from Kung Fu Tea (they weren't opened...I was saving them for later) and the lady there offered to put them in the fridge for me??!!! OMG I love you, lady.  

We sat at the bar and ordered our desserts and they brought out place settings, water, and the most adorable little plastic set of dishes, cups, and utensils for my toddler.  How incredibly thoughtful!  

The $12 angel cream is so pretty with it's sugared dome exterior, edible white chocolate angel wings, and pulled sugar ""halo"".  I was initially a bit scared by the description ""fromage mousse and pear mousse"" (CHEESE MOUSSE? EWW) but the dessert was light and melted in my mouth.  The bottom part of the dessert is like a soft cookie crumble.  The details on this thing are mind-boggling!  I loved this beautiful, intricate dessert. 

The $12 Ringo is a crisp apple pie and ice cream with whipped cream filled apple candy on the side.  Besides being absolutely gorgeous it was very tasty.  The pastry shell and apples were nice and warm and the ice cream was rich and decadent.  The cream-filled candy apple is a show-stopper and tastes exactly like creme brulee.  I loved it.

He helps me understand any limitations, to which he has helped me heal, and tells me how to stretch and what may be causing reoccurring issues. He is definitely thorough and will work with just about everyone through anything.

"Came here with some friends to hang out and catch up.  They have been here a lot, since it is handy and kid-friendly.  Seriously, reading the menu I thought it was just for kids.  Chicken wings, of course, and chicken in various other guises.  Burgers and sandwiches, etc.  The adults can have a drink, there's music and TV plus popcorn and games for distractions, and you're set.

It is loud, but not crazy.  Service was very good.  Overall it's a bit like Roosters or Applebee's.  The wings were fine, though not great: meaty but small.  Plenty of interesting sauces.  We had the seasonal bourbon (sweet, tangy, very good;) spicy garlic (not super hot, plenty of garlic, perhaps my favorite;)  spicy sesame (just a little heat, plus sweetness;) and goldfinger (sweet and tangy, pretty good.) 

Upcharges for celery (4 measly pieces) and dressing (generic tub.)  Seriously, why do these places charge extra for that?  And if you're going to, at least make it worth it.  I had wings the other day and had to add-on, but I got 10 fresh big pieces of celery, plus a container of very good dressing.  \/Rant. 

It's a little expensive; we paid $60-plus for three adults and a kid, and we were really just snacking while we talked, not eating a full meal.  Still, it was a fun place to hang out and the food is good enough.",1.0
"This hospital is literally walking distance from my house and I have wanted to use it several times as it would be very convenient. However, I have passed it over for the much more affordable South Valley Animal Hospital in Southern Highlands. Boarding prices for my terrier are double the price here as well as vaccinations. It's obvious they have not done their due diligence in researching nearby competitor pricing. I will continue to drive the extra distance to South Valley Animal Hospital for as long as this pet hospital continues to price gouge. Just because they are located at the heart of middle to upper middle class neighborhood does mean they have to take advantage. Fair and affordable pricing is important to everyone. In addition their staffs professional demeanor is not very inviting.",1.0
"This place is excellent. A relatively new spot in the city, it emerges as a real contender to Ja Bistro as one of the top sushi places in the downtown core. The torching is done with a special bamboo plank imported directly from Japan. Presentation on the dishes was fantastic, sauce and fish pairings were well thought out. Service was delightful and each fish was well explained. 

The seafood soba noodle dish alone was worth the bus ride down to the Harbour front, but there was really nothing we tried that I wouldn't order again. 

This place is known for its aburri (torched) style sushi while ja bistro is known more for its oshi (pressed) sushi, but in terms of overall quality I'd say they're pretty much on par.  I like the variety of cooked entrées here as well. 

Would definitely recommend!

"I have shopped at Smith's at Rancho & Charleston for over 30 years.  Recently, I have had several occasions when the food purchased had passed their expiration dates by weeks or in one case 2+ months.  My practice has been to check dates on everything.  But, today was the FINAL STRAW.  The cart that I grabbed was absolutely FILTHY.  I took a picture and then talked to Chris, operations assistant manager.  He told me that they would take cart out of service.  But, it went right back in the mix and someone took it to shop with.
This store has continually gone down hill.  Sadly, no other store is close but I guess a drive is in order.

"Last night was probably the absolute worst experience I've ever had in my life dining out. The staff was beyond rude, and I have no desire to eat here again. What I thought was going to be a good meal with friends turned into a brawl and heated argument. 

I walk into the restaurant, and stand in line. As we get closer to the register, a cook by the name of ""Miles"" (who knows if that is actually his name) points to us and says ""those girls can't eat here. Don't serve them."" I'm thinking this is all a joke. As my friends approach the register to put in their order, ""Miles"" gets upset and starts throwing around his towel, slamming meat on the grill, throwing his hands up getting all upset. This is when I know ""Miles"" was not kidding about us not wanting to serve us. 

I approach the register because it's my turn now to put in my order. ""Miles"" is still behind the register flailing his hands. I ask him if he had a problem with me and he says ""yea I do."" I asked him what it was that I did for him to be upset given that the only thing that I did was walk in the restaurant and stand in line. The young man at the register tells me not to mind his behavior, I said okay but I would like to speak with the manager. The young man on the register tells me that he was the manager, which I could hardly believe. 

I proceed down to the waiting area, and another incident occurs. The Same ""Miles"" accuses a young man of putting his hands on another female customer in an inappropriate manner. ""Miles"" tells the man that he needs to get out of the establishment ""because they were privately owned and he could kick out whoever he wanted to."" Apparently no one sees the man touch a girl, except for ""Miles"" and he was the only one with the issue. 

While I am waiting for my burger to be prepared, the ""Miles"" guy approaches me and he asks me ""so what's up?""  I have no idea why he approached me when he was supposed to be preparing my order. I tell him that he was a disappointment to me and that he has thoroughly embarrassed me. At this point I am standing next to the female police officer and ""Miles"" is now being more ""careful"" with his words. Another man approaches me at the end of the counter where I'm waiting for my order and asks me what was wrong. I tell him the story of everything that happened and I asked him who he was. He tells me his name was ""Miles"" too and that he too, was the manager. At this point I know all of the staff was playing a game. The ""manager"" says another girl threw the middle finger up at him. I ask what that had to do with me if that girl's sale had ended  and I had a separate receipt for my order. He didn't have an answer to my question. ""Miles"" sees me talking to ""the manager"" and says ""I don't care about that bitch because my check shits on what she makes. I make $70k so I don't have to deal with people like her"". 

I have absolutely no idea what his pay stub has to do with him saying I can't be served when I walk through the door, him calling me out of my name, or the experience I am entitled to have as a customer. ""Miles"" goes into the back kitchen and starts throwing around pots and pans because I tell him I'm done talking to him after his disrespect. ""Miles"" comes out of the kitchen and then interrupts my conversation with The police officer. I asked the police officer if she is seeing the disrespect that I am receiving. She says she can't do anything because he has not broken the law. ""Miles"" leans over the counter and asks me ""if I want to take this outside."" If you ask me, or anyone else, those are fighting words 1. In the context and 2. In the manner in which he said it. He is threatening me so much that the police officer steps in and says ""no one is stepping outside."" The ""manager"" approaches me again and asks me my order number. At this rate I was disgusted with the service and disrespect that I don't even want the burger. The ""manager"" takes the receipt out of my hand without my consent and then ""Miles"" throws the burger and fries at me. After that, I tell him that I'll be writing a review  and contacting corporate. ""Miles"" then tells me to ""get the fuck out"" and at this point my friends are walking me out of the restaurant and I leave. After I leave the restaurant he then finds the need to follow me out, leaving his workstation to antagonize me and my friends yelling at us on our way out of the epicenter. Why? I have no answer for this inappropriate mess. Where was his manager and why was it okay to leave his post??

Unfortunately, I am pissed that I paid for my burger and fries and received that level of disrespect and service. Even more pissed that I didn't trust that my burger was safe to eat. If I could post the video that I have of ""Miles"" I would. But I'll be sure to include this in my email to corporate. I was able to capture ""the manager"" and ""miles"" in the video.

The guys are super friendly when you walk in, greeting you with a smile. They're just super warm, which is definitely needed in an independent coffee shop. They have minimal seating but I can always find one during the day, and it's pretty comfy too. They have bar seats, a couch and a corner table that fits two. Perfect for your instagrammer friends that want to get the perfect aesthetic.

They use pilot coffee, which is a plus. Their prices are kind of steep in comparison to other coffee shops nearby but it's worth a try. I had a small iced latte made with coconut milk & it came out to over $5, for a small cup. It didn't taste any different in particular to the starbucks' iced latte but not saying it tasted bad either. It was just okay. They charge extra for different milks, which I expected.. but they do have coconut, soy and almond! They also offer coffee and ice cream together.. floats :o which is interesting.

"Came here with my boyfriend on a late Friday night as we had purchased a groupon ($75 for a 7 course meal for 2). The service was great, servers were overly friendly and accommating. We first got our miso soup (delicious! Not too salty and perfectly hot) then our house ginger salad (delicious as well). We then got a vegetable sushi roll which was so yummy, definitely one of the best rolls I've had and I wanted more. Next, the teppanyaki chef came and prepared our entrees! It was quite a fun show to watch especially the onion trick. He grilled some vegetables and vegetarian fried rice as our next meal. The vegetarian rice was ok, a bit too buttery tasting imo. The vegetables were yummy! For our main meal we had strip loin steak, lobster tail, chicken filet, shrimp, and Atlantic scallops. Yes, the groupon comes with all of these meats but not a full portion of each meat. It is extremely filling! I thought our steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and the shrimp was wonderfully juicy. I could have cared less for the chicken and scallops though. Then finally, to finish it off we got a scoop of ice cream!

I am a haggis snob thanks to being spoiled to real homemade haggis by the St. Louis St. Andrew's Society Ladies.  I have traveled around the States and Ontario and never found haggis like home.  This was good haggis. A bit too pasty, but the seasoning was delicious and it so far is #2 in my book compared to home.  I do recommend it.  They put a lot of gravy on it, it is not needed because their haggis is delicious.  

We also ordered the Highland chicken which was a chicken breast opened up with haggis inside.  The mashed potatoes have huge chunks of potatoes in it.  The burger is Highland grass fed beef - delicious taste.  

The sticky Toffee Pudding amazing.  Again, it's hard to find good pudding in the States and Ontario.  Totally recommend this too.

"I went to this spa last year and really loved the deep tissue detox massage. I took me a year to go back again. I was there for my second time today and had such an amazing massage again by a lady named Merry. A whole hour of bliss for me. deep tissue massage for what seemed like forever (which is great) then hot stone massage, followed by oil massage. all this while light music played in the background making it more relaxing. 
I don't know how this woman did not get tired , for a whole hour the pressure she used for my back , neck , legs was great! 
The lady asked me a few times if the pressure she was putting on was ok for me. I appreciated that.
I ended up buying a deal they offered at the end of the session. I am due back to visit this place another 6 times.

The only thing I can think of saying that I think they should really fix, is to give their receptionist more information about the services they offer. When I asked her about the other massages she didn't know much about them. It would be more helpful if she can give you details about what a particular massage entails. 

If you like to go to a fancy place and have a spa day this is probably not the best place as Hue spa is... well not that fancy looking on the outside or inside. But it has been clean both times I went and still very nice ... just not ""luxury""

If you don't want to spend a ridiculous amount but still have a great massage, I'd highly recommend this place.",1.0
"The staff here don't seem to communicate and are not concerned about wasting one's time. I stopped in to have my nails painted and was told the wait was 30 minutes. I had 1 hour 30 minutes to spare, so that seemed plausible.

The one nice experience was relaxing in the massage chair For the tech to finish her client. 

After 35 minutes, a man finished a foot reflexology massage on another client, and the nail tech moved on to that client. I asked how long she would take and she said 45 minutes. I told her I was quoted 30 minutes by the other employee, and she said, ""No, it was 30 minutes THEN 45 minutes."" 

I couldn't possibly have my nails done before boarding, and wouldn't have agreed to that. She didn't seem to particularly care.

"Ive been to a few gyms around town, but Rebel Fitness is cream of the crop.
I havent encountered an exercise I wanted to do or muscle I wated to work on that didnt have an area or equipment necessary to do it.
There's also no lines, no crowding, and no pressure for personal training.
The members form an intimate, friendly community, and everyone is clean and respectful of the gym and equipment.
Having an affordable 24 hour gym within walking distance that strives to cater to whatever need you may have, and still maintains an environment that supports you to be your best, is a breath of fresh air in this globo-gym filled city.

I'm overall happy because we got the item we wanted, at the price we wanted, and on time. 

Now for the negative.... It was not a good store experience. Sales people were very aggressive, just like car salesman. There was a few times I was at the desk, and the sales people would start having arguments with each other. It was all very unproffesional. The worst part was listening to their awful phone etiquette. They were extremely rude to people on the phone, and almost every conversation I overheard was about a complaint. So again, I was truly uncomfortable with having purchased with them. But at the end of the day I have my item.",1.0

"The Annex isn't exactly the type of place you'd normally find me. I like hole-in-the-wall bars, but this place is really more of a forgotten hideaway than a hidden gem. The atmosphere is dark, everything is old and outdated and it was cramped. 

It was also cramped because it was crowded, which means people love this place. There are some good reasons to- the bartenders and owner were really great. Fast service, good pours, friendly, and hospitable. The owner saw our large group and came over to set up a table for us right away.  The drinks were cheap and I like their monthly specials.

"First, Santa Rosa clinic doesn't always seat you with doctor you made an appointment with. I never saw dr Syed. The chick i did see was an idiot. I've been on SSRI's for the last 7 years.

"So the only positive of your birthday falling on a Monday is that you get to go to Soul and not even have to wait for a table. Place is intimate. Really intimate. As in I felt like I was also on a date with the tables on either side of me. Thats seriously the only con from my experience last night. It's a great place to go for a special occasion because you can justify ordering half of the 10,000 things you want.

We came for the pork belly tacos. This is a dish that actually lives up to the hype. I feel like so many of the ""must eat in charlotte"" things don't. The flavors were incredible. Really simple but the sauce on the pork belly and the watermelon were perfect compliments. I could have eaten 12 more.

"A friend of ours recommended that we try this place, I was intrigued and excited since I had a feeling this could be a type of Indo Chinese cuisine (big fan). I went in here and almost immediately realized that this place may answer my prayers, all the folks working there are from South India and so my expectations peaked a little more.
We ordered the spicy chicken, which absolutely hit the spot and was really good. The after effects of it was not so good. We then got the cayenne fried rice and the oriental noodles. Both disappointed me from an indo Chinese stand point, but then that's not what they advertise, so it's cool. The fried rice was actually good, keep in mind I do have high expectations. The noodles was pretty decent as well, just did not hit the right spots for my palate. Both the noodles and fried rice had an abundance of meat in it, very generous servings.
The staff is awesome and very friendly. Overall, I haven't decided if I love them or no, may need to go back and find out.",1.0
The breakfast here is pretty good. One day I ordered the chicken and waffles. The chicken was very juicy and not heavily breaded.

"I was really confident going in that Chris McCartan and his team could provide sound legal assistance based on a solid referral from a friend who had recently used Bill Powers in a DUI case and received a favorable verdict given the evidence against him  I was by no means expecting a miracle and couldn't compare one case to the other but didn't really expect to be treated as badly as I was considering the situation. 

I initially met with Chris for close to an hour, talked through the scenario and went over a few options. I was new to all this and nervous about how things could turn out but Chris made me feel comfortable, at ease and was very good at convincing me he was the right guy for the job....I felt like I was a priority in his book of business and was on board with having him represent me. 

Then came time for the court date...  I received nothing from his office giving me instructions on what to do or how to proceed with showing up to the courthouse the day of the hearing.  You guys can judge me all you want but I had never been in trouble prior to this and thought this was what I was paying for.

I had to call Chris' office numerous times the day of my 9am court appearance before anyone decided to  pick up and when someone finally did she was very rude and not willing to help at all. 

Once I was in the courtroom, Chris simply acknowledged my presence and continued the case. This happened on 3 other separate occasions following that and considering what I know now, that's pretty normal. What I noticed though in those visits was the stack of files that Chris was holding and how many people he was ultimately representing. 

I bring this up because the next time, the 4th and final time I was in the Cabarrus County courthouse under the representation of Chris McCartan, was one of the worst and most telling.  I had met with this guy on numerous occasions beforehand and really felt like he cared and had a grasp on my case. In the courtroom, I was sitting no less than an arm's length away from Chris (the exact spot I had sat every single time before) and when he got there he made eye contact and acknowledged me like it meant something.  

However, when my name was called, Chris stood up and started looking around the room for me saying my name and acting like he didn't see me.  I quickly recognized what was going on and spoke up to let the D.A. know I was actually present and Chris acted like he knew all along and gave me a wink and a nod and moved forward with little regard.  

It was then I realized I was dealing someone who either didn't care or had too big of a workload to truly understand the levity of what this meant to me each of his clients for that matter.  To further the frustration, right before we went in front of the judge, he asked me where I worked and what I did which told me he hadn't bothered to look at my file prior to that moment or else he would've seen that information which was readily available and had been discussed in earlier meetings.

To sum it up, I'm not a hater and I'm sure this guy has done some good things in his career but please be wary of him when considering lawyers.  My case was tough and like I said in the beginning, I wasn't expecting any miracles.  I simply hoped for a level of general respect that just wasn't there considering the money I paid and thought it prudent to post this review. 

Take a look at Chris' LinkedIn pic as I think it's a prime example of the unprofessional, cavalier attitude that so many in his position of perceived power take.  You're a joke dude!!

"Okay, I'll be honest, if you're looking for authentic Chinese food, keep looking. But I placed an order through Just Eat today, Combo A for 1 person.

First of all, the food arrived in fifteen minutes! I'm not even particularly close to the restaurant!  Fifteen minutes! It was piping hot and smelled great.

Second of all, I don't know who this ""1 person"" is that they have in mind when preparing this food but they can sure eat a lot. There is easily enough food to feed me for two or even three meals.

Third of all, the food is solid. It's not going to blow your mind with intricate flavours, but if you want some good old Canadianized Chinese food, this is it. I do wish the hot and sour soup and the general tao chicken were a touch spicier, but they were good anyway. All of the food was really good. Not great but perfect comfort food.

Fourth of all, the price! All this cost me less than $20 including tax and tip.

Can't remembered what I ordered, but it was a tomato-y soup type thing with some kinda pasta salad, was less than mediocre but ate it anyways cause it was kinda pricey, and it was the only restaurant in close proximity that I could grab something from.

"Pigeon Espresso Bar is the newest addition to a small group of new businesses at the corner of Maisonneuve and Bishop - right next to the brand new Brit&Chips.

The place is smaller than expected, and doesn't have any seats. The interior is simple and modern, with exposed brick walls and tons of beautiful greens dangling overhead. A large, shiny espresso machine seats in the middle of the counter, next to coffee grinders and a display of delicious-looking pastries. They carry their own beans, in addition to Brooklyn's Stumptown (a very nice brand). It's not cheap (2.50-5$). We ordered a latte, an americano and a cappuccino (Pigeon brand).

"The Daniel. S 2016 National Calendar Day 25 Review Challenge: Review 8\/25

    Today is one of the National Calendar Days that I am celebrating and yelping in 2016. It is National Hoagie Day. This National Calendar Day celebrates the hoagie which is a regional name for the hero, sub, or zeppelin. Where would I enjoy a hoagie after work? My investigative Internet search led me to Capriotti's. I got in my car and made a beeline down Eastern Avenue to the Capriotti's at the northwest corner of Warm Springs Road in the Albertson's - anchored shopping center. 

   National Hoagie Day marks the first time ever that I dined in a Capriotti's. Isn't that something that I lived in Las Vegas for close to 12 years and haven't dined in a Capriotti's? And isn't it something how celebrating some of the National Calendar Days leads people to new places, foods, and experiences? Now that National Hoagie Day led me here, I will report on my experience at the Eastern and Warm Springs Capriotti's. 

   This appears to be one of the older Capriotti's. If I am not mistaken, the oldest Capriotti's is off Sahara Avenue near the Strip. This certainly is a small Capriotti's. When I looked to the right there was the counter, paper menus, and overhead menu. When I looked to the left there was the imitation brick wall in back of a long skinny row table, eleven stools, a refrigerator, Pepsi fountain, and Wise potato chip rack. When I looked straight ahead the skinny public area dead-ended at a wall minus rest rooms. Restrooms are nonexistent. When I looked down, my smartphone was installing the Capriotti's app. 

    If I were to turn into a Capriotti's fan, the app would reward me with a complimentary hoagie, or as we call it in this part of the country a sub, after nine purchases. Instantaneously, it rewarded me $2 off my purchase for joining. 

   Prior to stepping foot inside this Capriotti's, I read all this positive praise for their Bobbie sandwich. Wikipedia stated that in 2009 AOL voted the Bobbie as the best sandwich in America ( https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capriotti%27s) and people have rated it highly. The upshot was that the Bobbie was the Star of National Hoagie Day 2016. 

   When I walked inside I picked up a paper menu to look at the options. I chose the small hoagie (sub) for $7.29. If this 9 inch hoagie (sub) is considered small, I'd love to see their large one. Ordering it could be slightly confusing. There is a want for an ""order here"" sign. Upon ordering the young women working here were friendly and one of them explained the Capriotti's app to me as it gave me my first discount. The young woman also let me know that the app also rewards me on my Birthday. 

    During my visit, it was apparent that the Pepsi soda fountain could use repair. When I poured the Dr. Pepper the handle would get stuck. Come to think of it, how come Pepsi doesn't have a Freestyle machine? 

   The Bobbie was ready in a few minutes. The paper wrapping it came in is an attractive touch. It felt like I was opening my Christmas present when it was a National Hoagie Day present. Ideally the Bobbie celebrates Thanksgiving. Between the long pieces of bread is a valley of stuffing, pushed turkey, cranberry sauce, and mayonnaise. This was a cold sandwich. And it was a loaded sandwich where the stuffing overflowed out of the valley of bread onto the paper below. With the exception of once biting into a bone, the Bobbie was delectable. 

    If there is a National Bandwagon Day count me out. I simply tell it how I see it. The way I see it is that the Bobbie is good at the same time it is not on the top tier. I prefer the hoagies (subs) that I have chowed down in Firehouse Subs over the Bobbie. If there is a return visit to Capriotti's, the Capastrami and Slaw Be Jo are my first choices.",1.0
"Just got home from eating here. I really wanted to like this place. Menu seemed decent, prices were nice, atmosphere was okay. The avocado bruschetta is little more than guacamole on toast. I had the short rib tacos, the meat was very bland and overcooked. My girlfriend had the shrimp tamales, which she said were too sweet and the sauce was too creamy. To top it all off, I find it in poor taste that the check would be brought out in a book with the Uncle Sal's logo on it. This is yet another one of Scottsdale's finest tourist trap restaurants that is not worth the time or money.",1.0

Very good sign  all I can say is excellent service and food! They continuously had food coming out and kept apologizing for the delay even though there wasn't really one at all. Everyone that worked there was very friendly, attentive, and helpful. We all enjoyed the food, no complaints. Thai tea was authentic and delicious as well.

Bang Bang is not a spot you'd try once and move along. You'll come back, and back, and probably back for a 2nd time the same day. If you're not sure what it is, essentially it's an ice cream parlour where you can get your ice cream in the form of a sammie between cookies, puff pastry, macaron or even a cinnamon bun. If you're more about the cone life, you can also get it with a sugar, waffle or HK waffle cone. There are so many ways to have your ice cream dessert, this is why you will keep coming back!

There are a number of different ice cream flavours - many of asian-related flavors. My favourite is anything matcha or milk tea related. Their taro isn't bad either.

JUST POST SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. The guy who answered was adamant that he had been posting about it for a month. They didn't. I checked.

First, It was visually appealing - lovely colors, layout of the food, and so on. Not the usually tan\/brown that you get at these events.I even took photos thinking I would somehow re-create it (yes, that is never going to happen but I can pretend). 

But even better was the taste. While I am a really good baker, his Brownies are the best I've ever had. Extremely moist and tasty I thought I had would have one, but soon was trying to hide the dish from everyone else. He also had an quiche\/egg dish which was a piece of heaven. It quickly disappeared.

"I will start this with the fact that the carpets look pretty good.

My husband kept hearing these advertised offers on the radio of $29 per room. We needed our carpets done, so he called and set up the cleaning. He didn't ask the price. That was his first mistake. I always ask. 

The apointment was today between 3-6pm. The tech showed up at 230 with not so much as a phone call. Normally I would love for someone to show up early, however I wasn't home, and my husband was sleeping as he works grave. Irritating. 

He asked my hubby if we wanted him to clean our couch. He quoted $125-$150. Um no way! 

I finally got home, and the tech began his upselling on me. I figured $29 per room at 5 rooms = $150. He comes up with a figure over $200. Huh?  He then goes in to a speal about cat urine being all over our house (our cats DO NOT pee in our house), and that he needed to do a special treatment, because if he only does the basic service, the smell from the cat urine will spray on to our walls and stink up the whole house. I ask what the price is. He then comes up with a $400 price. Say what?? 

He then said he needed to go talk to his manager on the phone to try to get us a lower price. Comes back and says he can do the treatment on 2 of the rooms for free, and just not tell his boss. Sneaky much? 

My husband and I talk it over, and decide to just do the basic only. The tech says fine, but he will throw in one room of treatment for free, because he wants us to be healthy. Ok.

I asked for the quote 1 last time. He quotes me $230. It's $29 per room, an oversized room charge of an undisclosed amount, $19 each for the hall and our bathroom, plus an $8 fuel charge. I was adding and wasn't sure why it came to $230, but just figured it was tax. 

He proceeded to do the job. Overall the house looks good. A few stains here and there that are hard to get out. Plus it smells good with some orange stuff they use. I will need to vacuum some stuff up, but that's to be expected with pet hair. 

Paid the $230, and he emailed the receipt. Discovered at dinner we were overcharged. We were charged $29 for the 5 rooms, another $25 for the ""oversize room fee"", $8 fuel, $20 for our tiny ass bathroom, and $32 for our hallway that's only as long as 2 bedroom doors! $32 for a HALLWAY, but $29 for the entire bedroom?? We were ripped off. He told us $19 each for the bathroom\/hall. Silly me for not getting an invoice first. 

They also advertise a free tile cleaning. He picked the tiny entryway tile in front of our door, which happens to be the smallest area in the house. It's only 4x4 tiles.

I would love to get my $13 back that I was not told about. I am also disappointed in the fact that I have heard so many good things about this company from friends, family, and yelp, and our experience was like that of a used car salesman.

Class A Moving is an exceptional company to deal with.  From scheduling to the actual move they are your partner from beginning to end. I was stressed having to move out of a big house to a much smaller apartment & it was the first time I've moved in 20 years.  Class A took charge from the first call right up until the truck drove away from my new home. Leaving me settled and calm. My moving team was Keith & Zino. These men were amazing. They took care of me and my things as though I were part of their family.  I had over 80 cartons packed with everything from clothes to crystal. Not one thing was broken and not one thing was missing. Keith & Zino went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable with the move.  They made this enormous task a piece of cake. I recommend them wholeheartedly.,1.0
"So happy to have found this place for lunch today. Hubby and I go to Jamaica every other year, so our expectations for authentic Jamaican food was in the, ""I hope it's at least close to what we're used to."" range. Wow, they blew us away. I had the Oxtails entree, and hubby the jerk pork . Both were amazing. All entrees arrived piping hot and the portions were huge. The food had the perfect amount of flavor and spice, plenty of gravy, and I didn't need my knife because the oxtails were like butter. We also had rum cake (yum!), and took home an order of jerk chicken for later. We're both kinda of coffee snobs, and the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee was delicious.

"So in March I came in to cancel my membership because I was starting school and would not have any time to go to the gym and I would not need my tanning package any longer. I was paying $32.99 a month. I was told I was all set when I left. So for some reason in April and May I was charged the $32.99 but with starting school and working a full time job I had a hard time coming in to handle that, so I emailed and called and got no answer. In June I got charged $65! (Which I was told was a maintenance fee)Wtf was $65 for when I tried to cancel and that was double my payment anyways. So today I was able to go in and speak with someone (he was very nice) and he said he saw it in the computer where I tried to cancel my membership in March...and then he tells me...to be honest, the owner probably will not credit you this money back  awesome.

Oh and btw they canceled my membership but they are still going to charge me the $32.99 for the next months payment las because ""I have a thirty day agreement"" so bad. I'm so angry.

True, the meals were perfect...delicious and filling and captured the southern cooking you advertise. But, we are retired. People with kids find it difficult to manage that kind of wait. Younger people on a date won't come back if they can get meals quicker elsewhere. You've got to turn those tables over much quicker. Your business will make more money, servers more tips.

The finance guy was Frank, he of course pushed the hard sell on options but respected my choices and my answer of No thank you, he offered alternative loan options and thoroughly explained each line item, when I asked why I should use his finance company instead of mine he was honest, I liked that. I will go back and I will recommend this place, and that is NEVER something I'd say in the past about buying a car.

"Wow. Simply put, if you're looking to have a pleasant buying experience take your business elsewhere. 

Here is my favourite quote by the owner on my first and final visit: ""I'm a professor of botany and an expert in every plant in here...somebody has to pay for that expertise""

Really?? No. I just want to pay for the air plants. 
I found him pretentious and rude. 

The reason for the 1 star (other than not being able to grant 0 stars) is the products are nice and there is a good variety. 

As a note, I was asking for a reduction in price as I was buying a variety of different items - and I think that's pretty standard in this kind of retail. He got very upset and instead of just saying ""no - the price is the price"" he launched into a whole speech. 
He did give me a deal on the air plant combination I got - and I did buy (I was in a bind) - but never again. 

Team @ eco|stem - learn what it means to provide customer service. People are not out to get you - you seem to be out to get your customers though. 
It is possible to have good products, at a price where you make money, and also provide friendly service. 

Happy to help you with that if you want a customer service consultant. I'll even give you a discount.",1.0
"My friends and I felt the need to get a nice juicy burger.  We were still slightly hungover at dinner time and did not really want to venture very far so we decided to check out Holsteins.

Pretty cool that they have two openings, one with a host stand and the other used as an exit.  Definitely helps with the flow of traffic.

The four of us asked for a table and were seated immediately.  It's a bit loud and probably not a place you would want to go to if you're looking to have a meaningful conversation.

But to keep you entertained, you just need to look around and get a good laugh from awesome cartoons of cows and sexy pickles and sexy burger buns.

Checking into Yelp you get 50% off on all draft beers!  Making them about $5-6 each, probably one of the best deals you could get around the strip.  Just note that they require each person who is ordering beer to check in.

After placing our drink orders we were given a bucket of seasoned popcorn.  I've never seen popcorn be eaten so quickly before...  We placed out dinner orders and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.

The burgers were a decent size and come with a small bucket of fries.  Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious.

"I scheduled for myself and my bridesmaid to have their hair done for my wedding at Zen Metro Spa. I picked Zen Metro Spa as my husband used to lived in Ohio City and used to go to this salon all the time. When I went to my hair trial, the stylist from the start kept commenting that this wasn't going to be perfect, and that she wasn't going to spend a long time curling my hair. She rushed through my trial and her end result was subpar. She blamed her less than ideal updo and definitely not bride quality on the fact that my hair was ""too clean"". Needless to say, I decided to have my hair done for my wedding by another person not associated with Zen Metro Spa. When I had my trial it was close to my wedding date so I had little time to change the appointment for my bridesmaids. When my bridesmaids arrived at the salon, the receptionists greeted them kindly however the stylist who had done my hair trial abrasively approached them with much attitude. I did not come to the salon with my bridesmaids initially but arrived later on, they all knew we had performed my trial based off of her poor demeanor and bad attitude. Another negative was that all the bridesmaids were charged different prices and the one bridesmaid who had the stylist who did my trial was charged the most and I do not think this was just a coincidence. I was really hoping for a more positive experience for my bridesmaids and I am very sadden that they we were treated in such a vindictive manner at what I thought was a higher end salon. I definitely would not recommend going to this salon for your wedding.",1.0

My buddies had the pho while I had the pad thai from their combo menu for about $10.50 before tax and tip. I didn't get a chance to try the pho, but the pad thai was really good compared to other Vietnamese restaurants I've been to. For starters, the portion was huge and was enough for two satisfying meals (I couldn't finish it in one sitting and had the leftovers for lunch the next day and was full from that too). The pad thai came with chicken, shrimp and tofu, they were very generous with the protein servings. The pad thai itself was cooked really well, albeit it was a bit more oily than usual. The combo also came with a can of pop, so all in all it was a great deal.",1.0

"Came here on a Sunday night and it was decently packed. There were about 5 tables waiting ahead of us but service was prompt and we were seated after about 15 minutes of waiting. 

The menu is straight forward but limited. For the appetizer, we tried the beef lung and tripe dish, which was served in a chilli sauce and it was actually very good. For the noodles, I ordered the pickled cabbage soup base with meatballs and my friend got the tomato soup base with beef. After tasting both soups, I think the tomato tasted better but both were very flavourful nonetheless. 

The pot that the soup comes in is hot so be careful not to burn yourself. The concept of being able to put different toppings into the pot by yourself (kinda like hot pot style) is quite attractive and makes this place unique. For the price you pay, their portions are very generous and although it was AYCE rice noodles, I could barely finish the noodles that were in my pot. 

Overall, I would recommend this place if you haven't tried it yet or if you're in the area!",1.0

After putting our name down to wait for a lane there was no staff to seat us for food, we eventually found a table ourselves after first sitting at a row of tables that hadn't been bussed, and even then the plates at the table were dirty.

"Had the ABSOLUTE worst experience at LoLos. 

My family has been fans of LoLos for a few years now. When the location opened up in Gilbert we were overjoyed and frequent this location. I had family in town from Sacramento and we decided to take them to LoLos for the first time. I had assumed this would be a safe recommendation since we have been here so often. I don't know what part of this story is worse. The fact my boyfriend found a hair on his waffle or my cousin finding a MOTH in her chicken tender plate. We were all mortified! The server was so embarrassed and said she would take the plates off of our check. As someone who works in customer service I was mostly disappointed in the manager who came over to us. All he said was ""Hey guys I heard we had some unpleasant experiences with our plates. I'm sorry about that."" That was it!! How could you just shrug it off that there was not only a dead moth in our food but hair as well! We are never going to LoLos again which is really disappointing considering it was a favorite of ours. Really hope they get their stuff together.",1.0

I asked him to review the security cameras they have placed around on the lot and he put me off. 
The ""father"" was shifty and shady. I called the police and filed a report. I told the officer about the one  camera that was RIGHT ON TOP OF MY RV! He asked the guy and the guy evaded and then said that the cameras didn't work!

Not the greatest alternative plan but got to try a new place which I wasn't planning on to! The milestones at the downtown markham is fairly large and has very nice decor. It almost looks much better and higher class than the other Milestones. 

Our server had mentioned the difference from this location from others, which were that all food items were freshly made to order.. So does that mean that the other locations have leftovers ready made to order? Just having tried a bunch of appetizers, everything tasted pretty good! Good portion size for all the appetizers. 

So far good overall experience but the customer service was lacking.. Our server seldomly came to check up on us and when trying to flag him down he always appeared to be nowhere to been seen.

This space has been numerous other restaurants over the years with different cuisines from Italian (twice), Greek, French, Indian and Chinese. Not a bad location so I don't know why restaurants have such a problem here. Granted that management is part of the equation but several of the previous restaurants had both good management and great food.

In any case, I like Sushi and decided to give it a try.

The first thing that strikes you when you walk in is the eclectic lighting, Dim lights and the accent colors are shades of magenta, blues and green, Reminds me of hour my room mate decorated our dorm room back in 1966. Not psychedelic  but getting close. Ourside of the lighting, the rest of the restaurant is tastefully decorated.

There is a notice as you walk in that is seeking to clarify the All You Can Eat Buffet to one with 50% off. Only good at certain times of the day and I left more confused than before I got there.

"On our first day in Vegas, we found out that they had Eggslut located in the Cosmopolitan which is right across from where we were staying.  Sooo happy because I've been wanting to try this place.  I knew they had one in LA but no idea there was one in Vegas.  

Upon arriving, there was a pretty long line going down the hallway where the bathrooms are.  The line almost made me want to go somewhere else but what the heck. We're in Vegas and I wanted to see what the hype was all about.  So we probably waited about 15-20 min in line.  Wasn't too bad. But then again, we are waiting for a sandwich. Although it's not just any sandwich.. it's an Eggslut sandwich and I can definitely say I am one.  I love eggs period.  Runny, boiled, poached, scrambled.. I like it all.  Anyways, when we finally got to order, I found out the turkey sausage was out.  So I opted for my second choice which was The Fairfax sandwich.  Our order came out pretty quick.  The problem was not enough tables but we luckily snagged a spot.  We came in a big group so our other friends sat a few tables down from us.

Now for the sandwich.. the brioche bun was definitely the perfect bun to use for an egg sandwich.  My scrambled eggs were a little bit on the runnier\/softer side which made it a little hard to eat but still very delicious.  I could taste the sriracha mayo in the sauce but I feel like it was still missing something.  Maybe a little more flavor.  But it was still good nonetheless and surprisingly very filing.

"Just opened 3 weeks ago. Serving 6 month old Goose Island IPAs. I'm not joking, I was given a ""fresh"" The Illinois"" bottle with over half a year of age on it in a 3 week old pub. The Green Line APA I was served from draft also tasted old. (For those that don't know, American style IPAs get their distinctive flavor from hops, and that flavor diminishes with age. For optimum flavor an IPA should be served with no more than 2-3 months of age on it... Old IPAs exhibit flavors of cardboard (oxidation) and unbalanced caramel and toffee from the malts. With American style IPAs, the  fresher the better.) 
Food is decent, but, a bit pricey for Las Vegas. Like most things at the Hard Rock, the space and the staff are attractive, and service is friendly. However, knowledge of their main product (beer) was sadly lacking. Any non-beer items require the waitstaff to leave the pub, as there is no kitchen in the pub itself.

"I've had this spot bookmarked for awhile and finally was able to give them a try. I was at The Cosmopolitan for a Yelp event where I'd just eaten so I decided to get two juices to bring home and try later.  

The guy behind the counter greeted me soon after I approached the counter. He made some recommendations based on some new products they just started carrying. I initially took one of his recommendations, but had to go back to my original plan when I saw that it had a fruit I may be allergic to in it.

The bottled juices are lined up nicely in the display so that you can easily read the ingredients. Each juice has a cute name like Bee Excellent or Bee Magnificent. The combinations are really interesting and combine fruits, vegetables, and spices. The bottled juices come in nice 16 oz. glass bottles. Now that I've disposed of my bottles I see that they give a $1 credit for every clean bottle returned. :) I'll definitely have to remember that for next time. In addition to bottled juices this location also offers smoothies, nut milks, and cocktails. 

The company website is really great. I didn't check it out until after my purchase, but will definitely check it out before my next visit to make sure I'm getting the right juice for what I need. All of the juices and smoothies are listed with not only ingredients, but with the benefits of each product. For example, Bee True To You is good for immunity boosting and allergy relief. 

Both of my juices were very good. Bee Grateful had carrot, pineapple juice, apple, ginger, and lemon. This juice was on the sweeter side, but had a great flavor. Bee Resilient was the real test of their ability to make great juice and they passed with flying colors. This juice had spinach, romaine, cucumber, kale, parsley, microgreens, lemon, and ginger. It was so good! I loved all of the nutrients I was getting and it was a tasty way to get my nutrients. Both juices had a smooth consistency without seeds or pieces of fruits or vegetables.

I didn't look at pricing before purchasing so I had some sticker shock as I signed the receipt for the two juices. After trying the product and reading the information on their website I do think it's worth the money. I'll definitely be back since I loved the juices and the nutritional content.",1.0

I usually play it safe and order the macaroni and cheese.  It is exceptionally mild so I like to take it back to work and add some sriracha sauce to it.

"I don't get why people complain. Renting a car from Alamo is very simple if you just plan a little bit. I reserved a car at a phenomenal rate about 2 months before my trip. I then signed up online for their free Insiders program so I could save a bit of money. I then created a reminder on my phone to tell me to use their check-in feature 24 hours before pickup. That whole process took 90 seconds. When it was time for my trip I checked in online, entered my credit card and driver's license info and that was it - another 90 seconds. I printed out the confirmation and when I got to the airport rental car garage, I just picked out any car I wanted in the category I reserved. No personal interaction or counters required. In my case I got a brand new Fiat 500. I got in, turned the key and left. That was it! Stop complaining about lines when all you have to do is take advantage of the many tools rental car companies provide these days. I was in and out in 5 minutes. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because upon drop off, I was told they couldn't find my rental agreement because my car was checked in two days before I even got there. Not sure how that happened and the inconvenience of having to go in to the terminal and explain that I didn't in fact turn the car in two days early because I was a 1000 miles away prompts me to knock a star off. Other than that it was smooth sailing and I will use Alamo again.",1.0
"The food is OK bar food but if you are a Chicago sports fan you HAVE to check out this place. Everything Chicago, and the people are rowdy and fun, even if you are rooting for the other team. My wife and I went here to watch the bruins because they were our second team (after the yotes) but have been converted to Blackhawk fans instead.

"This review is for my stylist Ashley Harwood (their are other Ashley's at this salon so I can't say how the others are).
     I've gone to Ashley for over 2 years now and am following her to the Regis salon because she's just that great. She's gotten my hair so soft and healthy!
Why to choose her:
1. She's very talented and detail oriented, you'll never leave with an bad cut or ugly color cause she takes pride in her work. See my picture!
2. Other STYLIST come to her to get their hair cut and colored...she's that good.

"Overall Oh Jah is a subpar suburbia establishment located where the old Pumi's used to be. The decor retains the same kitschy Americanized view of Asia. The food here is pretty bad through the service is fine. The sushi and Chinese dishes are bad enough that no one in my dining group bothered to eat more than two bites or bring any ""leftovers"" home. If the menu was completely revamped and the food made better than perhaps this place can avoid the same fate as Pumi's. Otherwise, I would avoid this pricey tasteless restaurant at all costs.",1.0
"We love good Steakhouses and we'd heard this was a good one to try in LV, but we're very disappointed. The food was great so ""Hats off to the chef"", but the service was the worst. They had 2 waiters waiting on us and still couldn't get it right. We had to continuously ask for drinks. They forgot half of our food. The meals came out the same time as our appetizers AND our salads. When the hostess came by and check to see how everything was going we told her we were having a terrible experience in their restaurant. She told us she would have a manager stop by which never happened. All in all the worst restaurant experience we've had in Las Vegas.

If you love to dance than Fir. or Sat. night is for you. After 10pm they clear the center of the place and it's a dance floor with a stage for the DJ. Plays all different types of music that flow as the night progresses. For you pool junkies the y have a small room past the bar filled with a few tables so you can just drink n play if you choose. Also a small little Mexican shop to get candy, drinks, spices and very VERY weird pinatas.

"I've been here a zillion times and never reviewed... that's crazy to me! I come to Rachel's so often craving their Chinese Chicken Salad and the Rachel's Chicken Salad Sandwich. Breakfast is good and is served all day. I love their juices and smoothies, too. I feel like portions for stuff like their sides of fries vary. Sometimes I get a handful, and sometimes I get a plateful. No rhyme or reason. The lines are so freaking long so much of the time, and the seating against the wall is so darn uncomfortable. If you sign up for their ""preferred guest"" program you'll eventually rack up free meals, and occasionally get random freebies like coffee, smoothies, etc. There's a check-in for a free glass of wine.",1.0
"Just picked up our order of 2lbs snow crab legs and 1lb shrimp Louisiana style ""mild"" and 1lb shrimp garlic butter ""mild"" to go. The waitress that helped me out was very helpful and nice. 

Got home all excited but we CANNOT eat any of it! None of it. Everything was too spicy. My wife loves spicy seafood, took one (1) bite and her face turned red right away. Again, we ordered ""mild"" so we just couldn't believe how spicy everything was. I understand the name of the restaurant is Hot n Juicy but this is just insane. 

Called them up to see what can be done since we had just paid close to $85. They said that they ""cannot control the batch of peppers they get"" and it can get really spicy. I was also advised to cook our food up again in butter. So our parents are currently recooking the meal that we paid for. Feeling very frustrated.

"June 15, 2016
My wife and I went to the Bell & Grand location (on a rare occasion when we had a babysitter) to get some pricing options on redoing our home kitchen. 
After milling around the kitchen department looking at sample displays for 15 minutes and being ignored by the two employees there, we finally approached one to ask for help. We were told that the only employee who could help us was on lunch break and was due back any minute. So, we waited. And waited. 
Now I worked for several retail companies in my younger days, including Home Depot, and I've rarely encountered lunch breaks over 30 minutes for even a full time worker on 8-10 hour shifts.
After waiting about 30 minutes for the employee who should've been back ""any minute"" we got bored and browsed the store, returning after a few laps to a still empty desk. We tracked down an employee from a neighboring department and were again told ""she should be back any minute."" At this point we had been in the store about an hour. After another fifteen minutes (even an hour long break should've been over by now) we had had enough of our time wasted.

"Having recently moved to LV from rainy Seattle, I'm new to sprinkler systems.  The portion controlling the flow of water out to the front yard developed a leak.  I called, got a quick appointment, and Jason came out to make the repair.  Turned out to be a relatively minor repair - leaky gasket on the filter.

But just as useful to me as the repair was the mini-tutorial I got from Jason, who took the time to walk me through the various parts and what they did (the previous owners of my house didn't leave any related manuals behind).

Got the replacement part, the repair, the service and the tutorial all for a good - indeed, affordable price.

UPDATE:  Fifteen months after my original repair, a different part on my sprinkler system sprung a leak and needed to be replaced, so I called ASR again.  Same Jason.  Same great service.  And again Jason was good about answering my questions about the sprinkler system.

I waited for about twenty minutes until an other customer sat out there as well, and he got served right away.  I gave the waiter a look and he realized he'd forgotten me, and was super apologetic. He promised to ""step on it"" and grab me a $3.79 cup of coffee to go, and was nice enough to bring the bill and take my cash off the table about five minutes before the actual paper cup of coffee ever materialized. A spoon or something to stir the honey would have been cool but the coffee itself was good enough I didn't end up needing honey, so at least there's that.  Whatever. Shit happens. I think what's going on here is that the brunch vibe is killing the coffee shop vibe, the model isn't really clear, and the service for people who think this is a coffee bar like it says on the sign is suffering.  I wouldn't come here again as if the place is a coffee bar, but know where to go if I need hipster brunch and a $4 cup of joe off the strip. Nice design. Chill location.",1.0

I arrived at Nanay's to find a wide assortment of entrees to choose from, in the usual turo-turo style as is custom with any Filipino establishment. It had been about a year since my last dinuguan so I knew I had to order some (absolute fav!). The meat was tender and broth was on point, a lot better than others I've had in the past. The chicken adobo came off the bone well and the lumpia came hot off the stove! Finally, I can't forget to mention the halo halo which is the best way to cool down especially as AZ starts to heat up for the summer.

"I was on a tight relocation schedule and we had to find a rental home in the Phoenix area during a week long visit.  Before my trip I contacted a number of real estate agents, property management companies and a few private home owners for homes that we wanted to view.  The people I talked with at Mark Brower Properties were, by far, the most responsive and helpful.  From the very beginning there was a clear line of communication.  Being on a shortened schedule I really did need quick responses to my questions and they were there for me every time.  All other property management companies that I had home inquires with would take days to answer even a simple question (Does the rent include pool service? Does the rent include the HOA?)  The entire application\/approval\/lease signing process with Mark Brower Properties went as perfectly as we could have ever hoped.  By the end of the week we had the key to our home in Phoenix and within a few weeks time had completed our move to Arizona.
I could easily stop here with my review but when we arrived to our home there was an issue with the irrigation system.  We had been in the home for less than 48 hours, did not even have our belongings yet as the U-Pack relo cubes were a bit delayed.  Our new neighbors informed us that there was an apparent water leak from the property of our home into their yard.  I was able to shut off the watering system at the inlet and contacted Mark's group through their web portal.  They immediately arranged to have the irrigation system serviced and found it was a stuck valve that apparently overloaded the system and caused the underground hose to fail.  Everything was fixed and the system is back online.
Again - I could stop there with this review.  We were very happy with the turn-around time for maintenance and felt very confident that we made a great choice to rent this home from this company.  Then the water bill came.  It was, as you might expect, extremely high.  It was almost 7 times more water use than average and we had not even lived but 1 week in the home.  To have to contact a property management company to come fix something is one thing, to have to contact them to dispute a very large amount of money is another - and we are still very new tenants in a home that we love - so it was a pretty stressful call to have to make.
Within a matter of a few hours Mark had a conversation with the home owners and arrangements regarding the excess water bill were done.  I cannot express how relieved we were that this was handled so quickly and fairly.  We are very happy to have rented a home from Mark Brower Properties.  Their help in both finding and maintaining our new home rental in Phoenix has been exceptional.",1.0

On arrival, we're asked if we had reservations, I reply ""No, this was a spontaneous choice."" I was lectured that one should always make a reservation. Not once, but three times the hostess said we should have made a reservation while leading us around the restaurant that was about 15% of capacity. Got it!

Asked if we'd like something to drink, I ordered a martini. It was poorly mixed with too much Vermouth. ...Our hostess mixed it...

By now, three or four other parties had arrived, all being lectured that they should have made reservations! Why not post this in a big block font on their website, rather than looking so rude and unprofessional when guests show?

We settle on two bowls of chowder since the menu isn't too extraordinary. Ordinary clam chowder. Meh, and a shrug of our shoulders.

The place is very small only 2 tables with 6 chairs each.  One table was taken when I got there so the space was very limited to even sit at the other table.

This probably would have been definitely 4 stars if not 5 but unfortunately the guy who took my order and made my steak, I specifically asked for no mushrooms and he put mushrooms on the sandwich which I did not know until I got home.

Went in for a moisturizing treatment. I have long hair. She said $20. I thought deal!

Stylist washed hair, then applied treatment. She spent a lot of energy going inch by inch applied it with the proper brush and technique. BUT THEN.... She used (get this) a large white garbage bag on my head instead of clipping my hair up to my head and wrapping it to go under the heater. So bc I have longer hair, the top of my hair was under heat, but the ends were flopping down near my back in the corner of this large white bag and they never got heat. The result after washing and halfdrying was that the ends had the gunky treatment that never absorbed and was now sealed in a hardened chunk around my bottom and ends of my hair.

You know what? Everyone makes mistakes, but the attitude of the stylist was not great and made me feel like they couldn't resolve it.

The stylists response to me when I asked her why she used such a big bag was ""I just work here"". Another one came over and started defending her\/attacking me the client.

That excitement faded as the HOURS passed that we were there due to my nail tech, Cindy, and I only know her name because the receptionist told me at the end. 
The first issue was that our appointments were not booked in their system after I confirmed they were days before. This got us started about 20minutes late as is. Then my nail tech decided her phone was more important than the services I was paying for ($55 for gel manicure). She verbally told me ""hold on"" as she sat back to continue texting. Her phone was glued to her the entire time as she tried to make phone calls and took them as well as sent texts. No wonder our appointments took hours. As she was doing my nails I asked for them to be evened out since they were very uneven and tried to explain what I was seeing. Maybe I was not explaining it the best and I even held up my hand as I have experienced other technicians do as I have gotten my nails done in the past to compare length\/shape so they are even. To be met with a rude remark that left me feeling talked down to I was emotionally done with this experience. I wanted to get out of there as soon as I possibly could, I was very frustrated. 
She did a less than desirable job with my manicure and pedicure. My feet are still rough and have dead skin, it would have been nice to get a thorough pedicure that leave my feet feeling soft and refreshed.... and for the manicure, the gel is uneven and even missing on some parts of the sides of my nails! When she was finishing up she asked me to ""feel my nails"" because they were rough on the top, then asked if that was ok. I get similar polish every time I get my nails done. I have not once ever felt them to be ""rough"" when they were finished. Again I was disappointed and replied with a ""not really, but I'm running late to another appointment"". She told me she would put more top coats on after seeing my friend call to let the next place know what was going on and hearing that I was already late to another appointment due to her phone interruptions. I just asked if I could just come back after my next appointment to have them fixed. I was really hoping I would be able to just sit with another technician to complete the task when I came back. Lucky enough I was! 
My friend was disappointed with her service but not necessarily the technician. She felt what she paid was on the high side for the services provided. She expressed to me that in the past when she has paid that price the pedicure had included longer massages, hot stones, etc. at different salons. I think it left her feeling a bit bummed out to pay that amount and not be met with the level\/value of service that she has experienced many other places. 
The technician sitting next to Cindy's station, who had been so pleasant the entire time, took care of fixing the top coat issues for me when I had to come back to fix them. And she was soooooo FAST but meticulous with fixing the top coat! She has great customer service and went out of her way to chat with me before her next client came in and made me feel very comfortable even though I wasn't her client. I wish I would have been placed with her, I feel it would have been a very different experience. 
I have never seen such a lack in professionalism from any nail technician I have encountered out here in Vegas, and hope not to run into this again. 
I certainly would not come back for any services with Cindy. I am still undecided if I would give it another try with someone else here. 
The receptionists that checked us in were so friendly and helpful, it was not her fault the appointments slipped through the cracks. The second nail technician who helped me was fabulous and really quite pleasant. However the technicians my friend and I were assigned to left us feeling frustrated, quite the opposite of what the goal was for our girls day on our day off. And upon my arrival home and showing them off to my fiancé I realized parts of my nails are left showing and were not even painted fully. There is even a spot on one of my thumbs that she did not take off the old gel and you can see that color instead of the color she applied today. I really wanted to like this salon because it's truly beautiful and some of their staff really rock it!",1.0
"Went here about 6 weeks ago, I think, to get a set of lashes done. First, the salon is super super cute. All white and turquoise and incredibly clean. I came with makeup on, so thought that may be a problem, but they had every kind of necessity in their washroom, complete with eye makeup remover to prep me for my set. It wasn't my first time getting lashes, but was my first time here, so I showed my technician what I wanted and she was easily able to give me the exact shape I was after. The only reason I'm docking one star is because I scheduled an appointment for a level two set, and she ran out of lashes on me so could only do the level one. And the room we were in was pretty warm, so I felt like we were both not as comfortable as could have been. But my lashes did last a while, I haven't been back since they're always booked whenever I have the time to come in (good problem for them to have, I suppose), but I'm hoping to be back soon!",1.0
"Joey is the man. Always available if you need anything. No matter how major or minor your problem may be he is there to help. I've had a couple cars derailed by him and his crew and they are always amazing. They even make sure the next day that your happy. 

In this particular review is my TL. The guys did a full inside and out detail. From tires to dashboard and Windows. Not a single part of my TL was missed. I will be sending my Tundra in next. 

Customer service is top notch and they don't break the bank. Very fair and reasonable. Also if they give you a deadline they deliver on it. Told me my car would be ready at 5 and had it at 430.",1.0
Love this place!  Great service reasonable prices and the hibachi gill chef was hilarious.  Had the ribeye and he cooked it to perfection!  Will definitely be back again with the rest of the crew to try the seafood and try the sushi bar.  They gave us a complimentary mango mochi ice cream. Good stuff. Be sure to come in whole all their new promotions are running!,1.0
"The happy Hour food has gone up in price. It is now 4 bucks for those decent mozzarella sticks. They still have the same beer draft prices though, but they turned over their whole management team and it's not the same vibe.",1.0
Fabulous bread and decent amount of meat on BIG sub. My medium is basically two lunches. Tasty pasta salad and no problem with big order for entire office.,1.0
"Shady area and surroundings. No lights in the parking lot at the rear of the hotel. Thin walls. Bed was broken and tilted towards one side. Lamp in the bedroom not working. Smelled like smoke in the hallways. 
And a big shoutout to the housekeeping that stole my portable charger straight from the bedside table.",1.0
"Finally got to come here with my family last night. In house craft beer, food, music all sounded great  However my partner and I both feel cheated today and bummed about our experience. Food: overpriced, tiny portions.
$14 for 4 tiny cheeses, a tablespoon of compote, seeds and hard as hell ' bread' that had more holes than grains. We couldn't find anything reasonably priced on the menu. Beer: bland and over yeasted. We are both craft beer lovers and enjoy making the rounds of the local breweries. We can tell good from bad. 
When we ordered the drinks eventually server came back to ask about food, but forgot drinks. Eventually ordered wine to forget about overpriced food, and even that sat at the bar while the staff chatted. Good things about the Burdock, seating, decor and patio outside. Live music? It is in a separate room ( not a hall ) next door with a cover charge. Our hostess was nice, there were other small kids there ( although I am not sure what they ate ) and the recorded music was good. Love Fela Ransome Kuti but maybe not on a loop. Oh, there is no sign to let you know you found the place- is this a deliberate cool thing to do? 
Overall highly disappointed but I see potential if certain things were fixed. But it appears that the owners do not read reviews otherwise our experience would have been much better.",1.0
"I enjoyed my visit to Annvita on Mother's Day weekend this year despite having some reservations due to reviews I have seen on here and attempting to navigate their website which was mainly in a language I don't know. However, my sister and I chose to bring our mom here since it was also in a convenient location. We had had experience with high tea at the Windsor Arms Hotel prior to this.

Despite all that, we still had a very lovely experience at Annvita! Maybe even the same or slightly better than Windsor Arms Hotel because our server was so kind and patient with us. The decor is very cute and really transports you away from the real world for a little while. The food was interesting and one thing that I believe some reviewers on here don't understand is that Annvita is originally from Hong Kong, so its definition of High Tea isn't exclusively British. It's like High Tea with some Asian influences so I thought that was very cool.

The milk teas were so delicious and you even have the option to order teas cold.",1.0
I am 25 and my girlfriend is 21. I made an obvious joke about how her ID was fake and that it was freshly printed. I received a rude lecture from the cashier about how I could get in trouble for joking like that. I am also commonly condescended to due to being and looking younger.,1.0
"The food was good but the girl that took the order was biatch. Never smiled, try to joke with her, just not a nice person. Very rude and should not be at the counter.",1.0
"Came here on a Sunday evening at around 7pm and there was already a line. This place is popular! Didn't have to wait long though - we were seated within 10 minutes. 

Had the takoyaki for appetizer. This was the best takoyaki I've ever had. Granted, I've only eaten takoyaki two other times in my life. But still! This one was delicious. Could taste the octopus inside, and the outside was nicely fried.

For ramen, I ordered the black sesame tan tan noodles. I know some other ramen places allow you to pick how salty the broth is. I kind of wish this option existed here, because I found the broth to be too salty. But I still enjoyed my ramen. The consistency of the noodles was chewy as expected, and the flavour of the broth was good. 

And for dessert, the mango pudding! Yummsville! I had read other yelp reviews about the mango pudding, so I wanted to give it a try. Super yums, definitely better than those ones you get at chinese dim sum places. This one had pieces of mango, and was more grainy. It came with a mint leaf, which I ripped into tiny pieces so that I could get some mint with each bite.

Overall, solid food, nice ambiance, and friendly staff.",1.0
Called this morning and was able to get my 15 year old cat in at 11:45 today. Dr. Hutchinson was such a nice man and his vet tech (didn't catch her name) was so sweet.  I hope I found them soon enough for Spooks sake.  I will be back.,1.0
"This is a great little place!  I came here on a Saturday at about 11:30 am.  I was worried that the place would be packed, but to my surprise, it was fairly empty.  We were seated as soon as we came in.  The decor is very nice and the place is very clean.  My only complaint is that it was very warm in the dining area.

I cooled myself off with my menu and decided on the spicy miso ramen lunch special.  I opted for the tuna roll as my side.  My girlfriend ordered the bento box and spicy tuna roll.  Hers came with a miso soup for starters.

The miso soup came first and I had to resist the urge to ask my girlfriend for a taste, but I knew I'd have my own huge bowl soon enough.  My ramen and sushi came next, and my girlfriends food came right behind that.  I was amazed about how huge the bowl of ramen was and worried if I would be able to finish it.

I tried a little bit of everything from my girlfriend's bento box, and everything was very good.  The beef was tender and flavorful.  Her only complaint was that she wished there was a bit more food, and she's very petite and isn't a huge eater.  I'm sure it would take a few bento boxes to fill up a guy of my size.

The ramen was so good.  It's the first time trying restaurant quality ramen and I'm glad it's more popular and available now.  The spice amount was just right, my nose was running by the time I finished the bowl. And yes, I did finish it.  Since this is my first time, I can't say it's the best I've ever had.  I will try some other places and see how they all stack up.

I was also pleased when the check came.  The lunch specials are very reasonably priced, and usually, when I'm in this area, I spend twice for lunch with my girlfriend.

I hope I'll get to try the Izakaya portion of the menu, since it's one of my favorite types of cuisine.  It's not really close enough to me to try it in the evening, but the next time I am in the area at happy hour time, I will stop here for sure.  I'm pretty envious of people who live in this area considering all of the options they have.  A very strong concentration of really good restaurants.",1.0
"I love coming to Echo & Rig for several reasons.  
1) It's so conveniently located by my office; it has become my second conference room.  (In case you don't know, it's located at Tivoli Village.)
2) Valet is right there! It takes me less than a minute to walk from the valet to the entrance of the restaurant, in three-inch heels! 
3) No one ever says no to Echo & Rig whenever I suggest this place, and I usually deal with picky\/snobby eaters. 
4) Service is always phenomenal.  They always make it a point to ask whether you're a first-timer or not.  They like to welcome you back and warmly greet new guests and explain the culture of the restaurant (this place is chef-owned, by the way).  For me, that's a plus because it gives me a couple minutes to breathe and watch someone else entertain my clients for a few minutes. 
5) The food is always exceptional.  My go-to is the duck because it is absolutely delicious, but the rib-eye cap is also heavenly.  If you do get the rib-eye cap, get it medium even though you like your steak medium rare like myself.  Due to the marbling of the cut, medium rare will make it too chewy.  I was a skeptic myself when the server suggested I have it cooked medium, and I made it a point to him that I will return it back to the kitchen if it's not good.  Needless to say, I didn't return it; it was perfection.  Yes, the portobello mushroom is their #1 seller, and yes, they are delicious.  Crab cakes are just ok even though it's 95% crab meat.  Caesars salad is well done if you really need a salad.  Their cauliflower is good and most people like it, but I like cauliflower without it being deep-fried, so I am biased.  
6) Extensive wine list and all their drinks are amazing and well done; the drinks keep getting better as you keep ordering...

"So far, I have had no real problems with pine ridge as a facility. I have had some very, very odd tenants that have lived near me. But all in all I have liked it. I have seen a few spiders in my bed, which to me makes all the hairs on my body stand up. However, the staff is pretty friendly. Had a clogged toilet and a broken disposal all in the same week. Maintenance came and took care of everything. Not sure why everyone hates the staff because they have been nothing but friendly to me! Specifically Courtney in the leasing office. She is awesome! She has helped me move not once, but twice in pine ridge! Would send anyone her way in confidence that she would take good care of them! Kendra was also very pleasant! Pine ridge is my first apartment complex out of high school but I do have to say I'm very pleased!",1.0
"Bumping the rating to 5 stars.
My brother recently came from Pakistan, karachi, and i took him to this restuarant.
He is a bigger foodie than I and even he said this is the real stuff.

Their specialty is their BBQ stuff. Best bihari kabab you can possibly have outside Pakistan, Chicken tikka is properly marinated and very rich in flavour (it just doesn't look spicy, it actually is), paratha is as good as ever.
One thing i forgot to mention in my previous review, their chutney (sauce) is really good, and they will gladly give you more if you need more.

Their service has improved, we went on a busy night and they had three servers instead of two. Our server promptly came at our table and took our order, followed up with us during our meal and in general had a nice attitude. 

Definitely recommended for all Pakistani food lovers, it doesn't get any better than this.",1.0
"Messini's is a classic case of a restaurant with excellent food at a great price....with sub-par service you have to suffer through. I go to this place quite a bit, so I clearly have made my choice in priorities! Honestly, the pitas are so good, the Greek fries are delicious, same with the salad, and the beer is cheap. But be prepared to sometimes be forgotten about, receive the wrong order, and not get any modifications honoured. Can't say it isn't worth the delicious (and cheap) food though!",1.0

"We had a good experience. The chef was on the money, the food was good, and we were entertained while in good company. The only negative is that all three of us had washing-machine-like stomachs later that night. This had nothing to do with the quality of the food, which was good; it was because we had such a variety of sauces mixed with eggs. Won't make that mistake again! This place is also a little on the pricey side, but it's worth the effort, especially for a special occasion. We went on the weekend, which I think is why we had a good experience.",1.0

"Spent my weekend at The Pickle Barrel. I love how the restaurant is located underground. I also liked the spacious atmosphere with the bar and kitchen. The restrooms are clean too; it doesn't require you to open the doors with your hands since there is a sensor when you enter\/exit.

There is a ton of options to choose from in the menu with drinks, appetizers, pasta, seafood, sandwiches, and more. 

I tried the baja fish tacos and hoisin ginger chicken bites to start. The chicken bites were a little on the dry side, but other than that, it was good. For the main course, I ordered the maple nut salmon. The fish had a subtle sweet flavour from the maple syrup and it complimented well with the mixed greens on the side. 

Overall, I enjoyed my visit at The Pickle Barrel since there is a lot of variety to choose from and the prices are reasonable, the servers were friendly and there is free Wi-Fi in the restaurant.

"Had I written this in February when I moved within the range of this place, I would have given it a lower score. The food was inconsistent at first but after March, I tried it again, off-handedly, and it was spot on and it's been spot on ever since. Zero complaints, even the driver's are 90% on time if not early. (noticed one younger man who usually is late but I tend to just avoid those days he works according to my patterns.) Keep up the good work, if this is the 'only' delivery option that you have in the area, you can do MUCH MUCH worse. Consistent, quality, doesn't skimp on topping and temperature is on spot 9\/10.

High quality items, Calzones, GARLIC CHEESE BREAD IS ZE BEST in the valley if you ask me, Pizzas.

"They are great at talking now to you face to face and setting things up for delivery if it's in stock, however if they have to order an item, worst follow up, worst customer service, they just don't care.

All the sales people work on commission so once the sale is done they no longer care about you, it's not their problem.


We bought 4 items, a desk, a dresser, a serving hutch and a chair.  The chair was the only item that had to be ordered because they did not have it in the store.  I was told it would be in on Tuesday and they would call...NO CALLS.

I called and talked to a guy who answered and said my salesman would be arriving to work in about 30 minutes and they would have him follow up and call me....NO call.

I then called a on Wednesday and talked to the store manager who said he would check with the warehouse and get back to me and yes that is correct, NO CALL.

Now almost two weeks from the day I orders this chair I call and the salesman was really nice and clearly said, we are busy and we work on commission so if I stop to look into this its taking my time away from a sale.

I did explain that I understand that none of this was his fault as he had nothing to do with this from the start through today when he picked up the phone so to not take anything I say personally as it is not directed towards him, I just needed to know if the chair is there or If I need to come in get
My money back and go somewhere else to buy the chair.  I told him I talked to the manager and everything I had dealt with and he said let me see what's going on.  I gave him the invoice number he looked it up and said it shows two in the warehouse, that my salesman was with a customer right now but he will have him call me back.  We will see.  As of now though, it's hard to recommend this store as a place to go because it's all commission driven and you are nothing more then the next sale and forgotten.

"This restaurant was an unexpected surprise. We were looking for a lunch place that was close to the city centre, and landed here by chance. The Jz's Signature Pizza had plenty of fresh toppings and bright flavors on a thin crispy base. We also got the braised beef ravioli, which had 7 large ravioli's stuffed with a sizable amount of tender braised beef. Both dishes seemed home made and was perfect for a quick italian lunch.

The space itself is small, with one row of bench\/table seating opposite the bar. We were only the second group of people there during lunchtime on a weekday, so was free to sit anywhere we wanted. It never got too busy, with the maximum of three groups of people at anytime. The service was friendly and prompt, checking up on us periodically to make sure we were finding everything okay.

The place has a very 1940s feel with a nice old fashion bar! The menu is massive - so if you have picky company it is a safe choice. The food takes a little while, but it is because they actually have a kitchen and not just a microwave. The waitress will read you a long list of specials that take like 5 minutes. This is not the place you go to if you are in a rush. This is the kid of place you go for a nice birthday\/valentines dinner. It almost seems like a fancy place, but the food is so cheap! It is hard to find a place that has a nice meal with a protein that is under 20! I had the Jack Daniel whiskey butter pork chops and a side of mac that honestly I am still dreaming about, which I think was around 15 bucks. I highly recommend trying it!",1.0

I went for a dermaplane special advertised on their website and a Botox injection. The dermaplane left my skin feeling baby soft! I did my research beforehand because I was slightly nervous getting my botox done at a smaller establishment. The Dr was very comforting and knew exactly what she was doing. She explained the whole process and gave me differently options. Injections were quick and almost painless. Best of all it was all very affordable.

When you are trying to spend your money and are treated like you are bothering them or interrupting their personal conversation, it's not pleasant.  Now when they mess up and then talk to you rudely like it's your fault for requiring them to do their job, I'm done.  You have officially made me never want to spend my money at a Sallys again.

"Slightly above average food, but the location and scenery are fantastic so I am rounding up for the overall experience. Schlösslesmühle is tucked into a narrow valley about halfway between Leinfelden and Waldenbuch, and while you can drive there, the best way to get there is to walk or bike from the parking lot near the Musberg Seebruckenmühle bus stop (~25 minute walk) or the lot near the Musberg Eselsmühle bus stop (~45 minute walk). There are a few parking spots out front, but no more than 4-5; walking or biking here is the norm. 

Most of the seating is outside in a beer garden, but there are a few tables inside as well. Ordering is done at the register, when food is ready a server walks out and calls the order number, you raise you hand, and they bring it over. Prices were fine for the portion sizes, less than €20 total for two beers, a brat platter with salad and fries, and a piece of strawberry cake, which fed two of us. 

Food was a little above average, but nothing amazing. The salad plate that came with the brat platter had a little bit of mixed greens, some pickled radish, and some potato salad as well; the variety was nice rather than just getting a giant plate of greens. The brats (a plump and white style) were nicely grilled, with the casings crisped up better than usual. Pommes were, well, pommes, and had the usual seasoned-salt shaken over them.

"This place has been around for several years! I'm excited Yelp is now here to leave a review!! I went in here after grocery shopping one day to get a pizza to go, mind you I said to go! Plus they are located right by Fry's grocery store! I was informed they had a dress code! After I paid & was given my order. Had someone told me before I'm sure they knew I wouldn't have bothered to spend my money on their establishment! I was 9 months Prego in summer I wanted to grab something quick & go home. I was obviously dressed well enough to be in the grocery store shopping. (I'm not the person running around in my pj's) NEVER WENT BACK NEVER PLAN TO !!",1.0
"Sometimes you come across something that just amazes you.  I was looking to get a gel mani and pedi today and found there are really not any really good nail salons in the Pittsburgh area.  However, I came across Miss T's.

First when you walk in it is so calm.  You don't have this constant buzz of people running around and the constant chatter.  And the place is so clean and inviting.  Gabrielle took care of me today and she is amazing.  So much attending to detail and she takes pride in her work.  My nails have never looked this nice.

"I cannot find fault with Gaetano's. Not one. Okay, it ain't cheap (we spent close to $100 for two between two entrees and two cocktails) but it's worth every cent. We've been here a couple of times and although it's far across town, it's worth the drive.

The ambiance is very nice. Clean. Classy. Great date night place. The hostess (I assume Mrs Gaetano) is very friendly. Our server, Gaetano's son, was very knowledgeable about the menu and all 4, count em 4, entree specials. We saw Gaetano make a few rounds. You can tell this family takes great pride in their restaurant and food. 

We skipped over apps and indulged in the delicious bread basket. The Italian loaf is soooooo good and obviously made on site. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs (tip: this is not on the menu even though it's hands down the best spaghetti and meatball dish I've ever had. No, really, it's the best. So good, in fact, that I never order spaghetti and meatballs at any other restaurant. Yes, it's that good.). The BF ordered the pork bracciole special which came with pillowy homemade gnocchi. Both our entrees were freaking delicious and the portions were huge. This sets Gaetano's apart from some of the other nicer Italian places in town. They don't skimp on portions. We had plenty leftover for the next day. And the leftovers tasted just as good as the night before. The BF says the bracciole tasted even better the next day. 

I highly recommend Gaetano's. Order the spaghetti and meatballs and thank me later!",1.0
"When I visit my sister in Phoenix, I'll often grab breakfast burritos here.  I've always liked all the ""-berto's"" restaurants (Aliburtos, FIlibertos, Dilberto's, etc) because the portions, flavors, and prices are decent.",1.0
"Came across this place that was open late on a Sunday night after Lights of the World by Rawhide. It was a nice surprise that the food prices was very reasonable and the flavors of what we ordered was very good. Walnut shrimp was a nice sized prawn. Crunchy outside texture. The portion of the black bean chicken was great and with very good flavor. The beef chow fun had enough flavor that only needed some chili oil (must ask for it as only shiracha is on the tables). Sweet and sour pork was very big portion as well. But not the best and not the worst. 

No chopsticks when asked (but I believe the Resturant is very new and was explained wasn't available just yet). We saw a man come in after we started to eat with a bag full of chopsticks. Eating area is little. Two tables seating four people and one table that sits two. Four bar stools are also available for seating. 

Overall I would recommend this Resturant in the simple fact that it stays open late (miss Chinatown in LA) which is rare for the Phoenix area and the food is pretty good w nice sized portions.",1.0
Cutest little family coffeeshop I've been to. The atmosphere is rustic with varying instrumental music playing in the background (since my stay I've heard genres from jazz to Harry Potter). The owner always seem to strike up conversation with everyone that comes in. They also have a drive thru which is a HUGE plus for those that just want a quick local coffee fix. They make most of their baked goods in house and I've heard great things about their food. This is a great place to catch up with an old friend over coffee or to enjoy a quick lunch by yourself. Place is a tad small for bigger groups (~4) but there's nice outdoor seating!,1.0

 So  moms and I had our last dinner before my gfs and I had to head back to OC . She was all about coming here. My gf's not so much until one of them read the menu after we already got there and she wished she came with us after all, Oy Vey LOL.

  So I'm not a Vegas visitor  nor a visitor of Nevada period. Not like I'm a hater, just don't have the opportunity much to do so. So casinos are still new to me and trying to find this place was a bit annoying. My fault for not parking in the right place, but we wouldn't have known anyway since this was our first visit and reviews didn't really tell us where to go. So I'd say, park by the 24 hour café  entrance you'll see a sign on where to go from there.  So after scaling half the casino, we finally found it following the signs.  We walk up and it states seat yourself but the tables were either sat in or needed busing. So then we saw the bar which we originally wanted to sit in but they would only have one seat available or tops needing to be cleaned. I said let me see and we turned a slight corner and there were two tops at the bar, I just couldn't see them until I walked around. I kinda wish they had a hostess stand to eliminate the confusion blah. 

   So I went in and turned the corner to see if there were two bar chairs open and yes there was, I guess they couldn't be seen by this obstructed view. Once seated the chef\/server came by and asked for our drink orders. He was nice and sweet ,even hooked me up when I took an order of chowder home for my sister, charged me for a cup instead of a bowl :) Thanks boo.  I ordered a cosmo and he made it. I don't think he's up on the girly drinks but it was good nonetheless :p  We started with cups of clam chowder. The soup came out reasonably fast and extremely fresh and hot. First taste and e were in love. This was the classic clam chowder we were looking for . The consistency was thick and creamy. A nice balance of clams and potato. This was beyond good and my mother and I knew my sister would love it!  Only thing that bummed us out was the lack of oyster crackers!!!! How do ya'll not have oyster crackers on deck!!!!!! I mean its a staple with clam chowder! It's ok, the clam chowder tasted so great all was forgiven :p  We also ordered little neck clams and those were bountiful. The clams were great, the broth was a bit bland and a bit tooooo citrus in taste. I bet the next day it would be better. 

   At first we were going to get our own dishes but the portions are HUGE, so we shared a shrimp boil. This dish is SPICY and if you take it home for leftovers, it will be super SPICY the next day and I'm so surprised my mother was able to eat them the following day.  Lots of shrimp, Andouille sausage , corn on the cob and my mom's favorite okra. I would have loved a side of rice .Again super fresh ingredients and overall a solid dish. I ordered this for her so I was willing to sacrifice what I wanted since I know driving a seafood dish back to cali the next day would not be ideal . My mom was happy and satisfied.

"I am rating my experience with Pete's Transmission as 1 star. I originally took my trailblazer there because it would not shift out of second gear after about an hour of driving. They took my truck on a test drive as well as hooked it up to a scanner and said I needed to have my transmission rebuilt. 
So on a Monday I dropped it off and by Thursday it was ready. The very next day I went to back out of the parking space at the store and the shift lever moves freely but the truck stays in park. So I had to leave my truck overnight. Pete's was closed due to a family event. In the meantime I had a friend tell me to check to see if the shift cable was connected to the transmission. Sure enough it had some how come loose. So I snapped it back together. And I was able to shift out of park and through all the gears. 
About 300miles later the truck started to take a long time(5-10seconds) to get up to speed from the stoplight, like it was in a higher gear or something. Again after it's been driven awhile. So I took it back to Pete's they kept it couple days then told me they changed one of the shift solenoids. After driving it a couple days it again started to do the same thing after coming to a stop. The truck once it gets warm it won't shift out of the higher gear. I took to Pete's again and they tell me that I have an ignition module problem. And that I need to take it to another shop they recommend to have them look at it. Oh by the way it would be $90 for them to look at. So long story short either Pete's charged me for a transmission rebuild I didn't need. Because it was always an electrical problem. Or the rebuild work they did was shoddy.  That's my experience with Pete's Transmission. 

Update to my experience. I took my truck to another transmission shop. They told me I did not have a module problem. They said they needed to disassemble the transmission to take a look. They allowed me to look at the parts that were supposedly replaced from the rebuild at Pete's aswell as parts that should have been replaced but we're not.  Since they rebuilt my transmission it has been running great. I was not happy with the price however  I think they way overcharged me $2700 was the total price. So I am not giving that shops name. But at least my truck is running now.",1.0
"It's not much to look at but don't let that fool you. Well made and thought out entrees. Service was very good and manager (or maybe owner) came by to see how everything was. I had the best pork chop I ever had, he said they came in last night to start smoking them. My only complaint was I could have used more of the pan sauce. My wife loved her salmon very fresh.  Her risotto was a bit bland but maybe that's because she ordered it without bacon. We split a Caesar salad and the tiramisu was freaking outstanding. The lighting at our table was harsh, like an interrogation room, but the owner explained they were testing new lights and they'd be switched out for softer ones. Overall, we really enjoyed ourselves and were glad we tried it because we'd heard so many good things. A credit to the neighborhood for sure.",1.0
"I was beyond excited to finally try this place, because of all the hype about it being the best! We pretty much grabbed each flavor so I had a pretty good taste of most of them. Most of them tasted the same and not really their actual flavor, but they were soft and fresh so that was good. The one I enjoyed the most had to be the Creme brûlée. The donuts are decorated amazing which is probably why they are so hyped, but overall they tasted just like average donuts. The price is pretty expensive compared to other donut joints. The service was very nice and sweet, they explained to us all their flavors and their number one sellers which was great. I'm glad I finally tried it and got to see what the hype was all about.",1.0

I have an extremely busy schedule so that was already inconvenient enough for me.

Excuse me? I then asked for my prescription which they refused to provide to me. They offered to give me glasses prescriptions then told me I would need to pay full price because I'm no longer eligible for my insurance because it was used. Wonderful! America's Best =Trash. Go to a reputable place for your eyes...skip the convenience, it often turns into inconvenience later.",1.0
"This place is absolutely not what I expected. We did the Peek-a-boo room which was a very small room meant for 8 people.  My friends and I found a living social and decided to check this place out. If you had nothing to compare this to, it may not be as bad as I thought.   I went to the original escape room in LA and this room was large with different clues and puzzles you had to figure out. 

Peek-a-boo is a very small room\/""nursery"" that is haunted and you're  trying to find a key to get out. The room was claustrophobic, especially for the 7 guys I was with.  There was NO aspect of realism and in no way do you get into character with the crappy job they do decorating the small space they have. Every group takes a group picture before heading into the room or after and my picture was blurry and half the people had red eye. The kid took a picture one janky old phone, not even a camera and they charge $3 per picture. Of course I bought one and it turned out like crap. Even the picture the guy took on my iPhone was horrible. Not one decent picture to capture the memories of that day. Maybe that's a good thing because this place is not worth the money. Trust me.",1.0

"We rented a property managed by Asset for 2 years. There were some cons, but overall it was a pretty average experience.  

Sadly the office is older and smells like cigarette smoke, which is a turn off at first impression. Staff turnover also seemed high, as I believe only one of the original employees we dealt with at the start of our lease were still there at the end of our lease. This made it difficult because some of the people we spoke to about issues in the beginning weren't there when it came up again. (When we moved in we were told by an employee to use the beige paint in our garage to touch up the walls... well, we did, and it didn't match. The person that told us to do it doesn't work there anymore, so we couldn't discuss it with her and ended up having to paint the entire house at our expense for fear that we would be charged more for it anyways. Why leave paint and tell us to use it if it didn't match? I honestly have no clue.)

We dealt with a few employees who were very rude and unprofessional, but others were kind and attentive (Paula is awesome!). We did have issues going back and forth about a repair that shouldn't have been our responsibility, but they were trying to make ours. It was a pain, but was eventually resolved in our favor after several months of going back and forth. Just an unecessary headache.

Another thing to be aware of is that they don't do walk throughs at the time of move in or move out. This is a little scary because you never know what happens after you turn in your keys. I don't know why their policy is like this? So, take LOTS of pictures, video tape, and write everything down when you move in (and out). They give you a move in checklist, so notate every little thing.  If you dont notate it then, you'll be charged later. Send emails so you have a paper trail and be prepared to leave the house looking nicer than it did when you moved in. (Their repair person charges astronomical amounts of money for minor repairs, so do the best you can). Use their vendors for cleaning (Project Spotless--they're actually very good and reasonably priced) and keep all receipts. 

Also be aware that there may be a sewer bill that you may or may not know about that isn't billed to you until you move out. We got a $470-ish bill at the time of move out that we weren't aware of because it was in the owner's name and being billed to the office. I would've rather paid this yearly, but it's ok. Just make sure you ask so it's not a surprise.

They are a little outdated and don't have an online portal to pay rent, so that was a little annoying.  I mailed it every month and I never had a problem, but it would've been more convenient with an online payment option.

Overall, they could use some improvements and more professionalism at times, but I wouldn't mind renting from them again. Our move out went smoothly and we got back the majority of our deposit, fairly so.  The house we rented was beautiful and we loved it for the time we were there.",1.0

"They tried.  I brought my car in for some warranty work.  Specifically, the headliner was defective, the interior had some rattling noises, and some of the body panels had poor alignment.  I dropped the car off for the headliner repair and was told it would take less than a day.  Apparently they didn't inspect the new headliner before they took everything apart so when they went to install it they found it to be damaged.  This was around the holidays so for a variety of reasons I didn't end up getting my car back for two weeks.  The whole time they left it outside in the rain, so it was filthy.  I explained that I didn't want it put through the automatic car wash because I am very paticular about the paint and was told it would be hand washed.  It was filthy when I picked it up.  The next day I washed it and noticed two new scratches on the rear bumper.  I called and asked if they could be taken care of and was told that they were not caused by Berge Ford.  They weren't noted in the initial inspection, but that didn't seem to matter.  Since I didn't see them under the layer of filth when I picked up the car I was out of luck.  

They did a good job on the panel alignment at the body shop.  The headliner installation quality is OK (not great), but the rattles in the interior are still not fixed.  

The service advisors were super nice and did their best to help.  They did get me a rental car when they had my car for the headliner repair.  They were a little disorganized with the shuttle and when I picked up the car, but it is a busy place.

This was my first time ever at an escape place so I had no idea what to expect. I was primarily concerned about my wife wanting to divorce me after or feeling like I would become hulk (which would be frowned upon).

"This is the worst place I have ever been to,  I went to Katsur dental because they accepted my insurance and they were the closest to me and 20 minutes away isn't exactly close either,  I had some issues with my top teeth witch resulted in me having to have all of my top teeth extracted and get dentures,  I was told that I would be without teeth for 6-8 weeks,  it has been almost six months,  I got a call today after my denture plate arrived with the wax teeth to make my appointment with the dentist for the fitting,  now aside from the fact that I was guaranteed my teeth my Thanksgiving and then before Christmas,  they have had my plate at the lab for the last six weeks and they claim they just got out back today,  so when I tried to get in asap they claim that the dentist is out of the office for a few days,  so when I asked when he would be back they told me they could do December the 23rd at noon,  well I didn't ask that,  I wanted to know when he would be back and I expressed it,  they then told me that he would be back by the 20th so I had to fight for an earlier appointment for the 20th,  they are rude and inconsiderate and quite possibly the most incompetent individuals I have ever had the displeasure to have known,  I cannot wait until this experience is over. I have never been so depressed in my life. For the record,  I give this place negative five stars.",1.0
"I came here with my friends earlier this evening for dinner. There wasn't a lot people waiting but we waited maybe about 10 mins for our table. We were seated in the party room, the one with the karaoke stage lol. Our server is a middle-aged ahjumma and she was so friendly and cheery! Is she always like that?? Lol anyway, I ordered the Steven's donkatsu (7.99) and the pieces are long and did not come with the typical donkatsu sauce. It came with a side of wasabi mayo which was still good. I also shared an order of jajangmyun + tangsooyuk combo (15.99)  - yes I know I'm a piggy what?! My friends got pork bone soup, kimchi with pork stew, and jajangmyun and they all enjoyed it. 

I also checked in for a free pop (even though I don't drink pop that often, but being Asian...I wanted to redeem a free drink lol). When we got our bill, I realized our server (the super cheery ahjumma) gave us the wrong bill. We quickly let another server know and the cheery lady came back and apologized and gave us our correct bill. 

Lastly, I find songcook has really good customer service! It's quite rare to have good service in Asian restaurants such as this one. So props to the management team for training their staff well! It definitely made our dining experience a great one! Will be back!",1.0

"I opened my hot to go box, ready to demolish the contents and I see NO CHICKEN. I ordered CHICKEN PAD THAI...where's the chicken. I initially thought that they must have given me the wrong order. However, after some serious digging, I found 3 pieces of chicken. Yes, THREE. I basically paid $10 for noodles and a burnt spring roll :-(
Although though the flavor was good, I likely will not be back. I know I can get more bang...or chicken, for my buck.",1.0
"I was here last night to have a dinner with my friends as they were craving pasta. We were quoted a 15 minute wait, which was pretty accurate. After a short wait, we were taken to a nice booth seat, and our server came right away. We ordered some cocktails and th buffalo chicken as appetizers. Their cocktails are pretty big for their price and they tasted very good- we ordered blood orange margarita, blood orange mojito and pina colada. With our cocktails, the server brought us some warm breads with butter, which were good as well. 

The buffalo chicken was a deep fried dish of buffalo marinaded chicken chunks. However, there wasn't enough cheese or chicken inside the fried skin, so we had to end up just digging for the chicken to not get full from the fried part. As soon as we were done with our appetizers, our pastas were served. The portions were enourmous, like how cheesecake serves all their foods. 

Along with two bowtie pastas that my friends ordered which seemed fine, my shrimp scampi failed. The angel hair was dry when serves, there was no sauce, and it seemed like it was waiting for the kitchen line for awhile to be served. The shrimp was not sauteed as mentioned on their description but it was deep fried-and remember their appetizer was heavily fried as well. There was just not enough sauce for the whole dish to feel moist. The shrimps were so heavy that it did not go well with the angel hair. Also, their garlics were not sliced at all; but served in chunks. 

Their service was good, but if I were to go back again, I would stay with the skinny side of their menu, since they do not deep fry every ingredient.",1.0
"I work in the service industry. I get that busy days suck and are stressful. But after the absolutely terrible service I experienced here, you bet your life I will never be returning and I will be telling everyone I know to stay away.

The first time, I chalked it up to him having a bad day, but now having had the misfortune of being served by him a second time, I feel compelled to write this review.

We were told that larger groups could make weekend reservations, and then discovered later that either we were lied to, or that another group adjacent to us had been given an exception. Not cool, either have an official policy that all guests are held to, or don't. We had a big group that were excited to spend money and time as we were promised, and despite the back room being very empty, members of our group were told there was no more room and turned away from the outset, even though we were happy to sit at separate tables, etc. When I did make it in to join my group, items that cost money came quickly(as they did last time) but I had to make the extremely simple request for WATER three times before the server(who I had to ask, nicely I might add, for water numerous times last time as well, before eventually giving up and never getting it) snapped ""when I get a second!"" and then went back to turning away more paying customers as is apparently his custom. Then a moment later he informed us that for a group our size, a tip would be included in the bill. Which is usually fair, except when you've turned away members of our group for no discernable reason, refused to bring water, been a snappy asshole about it, and generally acted as though we hadn't earned the privilege of you doing your damn job. More members of our group arrived at that time and were promptly again told there was no room, despite being able to see with their own eyes that the back room was less than half full. Last time our group were all able to be seated, but despite the room still being pretty empty, service was rude, slow, and snappy. 

After waiting a little longer, we decided to leave because we were unhappy, at which point we tried numerous times to attract our server's attention, all of which were met with abject ignorance. Finally one of our group members got up and went to find him and got the bill. We tipped him more than he deserved for reasons that still boggle me, and went a few doors down where we sat for hours and had great service. Such a shame, as Castle is a great place except for this one guy who has absolutely ruined our experience on two separate occasions. I won't be back.",1.0
"I'm seated on the front patio at Market Street Kitchen beside a weathered metal rail. The midday sun throws its light across the table and my skin with a gentle cooling breeze to follow as a chaser. A server politely places a glass of water to my right as I recline in silence with my book. I put my sunglasses on for the brightness, but chose this spot on purpose.

A text from a friend tells me to try the ""pork chili verde"". Unable to locate it on the menu, I request some help from my server, who informs me that she probably means the Green Chili Pork Stew. I order that and a tall glass of the Seasonal IPA on tap. The beer is delivered to me as I watch the passersby in a contemplating silence.

Raising the beer to my mouth, the smell of it reminds me of my uncle - shirtless in the summers of New Jersey - cooking chicken, hot dogs, burgers at his grill. The image is an unexpected flashback to the questions of my youth. The memory has something to say of manhood, I believe. Taking my first sip of the drink, I savor every drop.

The food arrives as I pore over pages of a book that I brought with me just for this. Closing it, my attention turns to witness what I've ordered. A rectangular plate, neatly sequenced, holds on its left-hand side a small rectangular tub filled with steaming stew and topped with a grilled jalapeño. Arranged, unassuming, to the right: a stack of lightly-grilled tortillas.

I remove the pepper and dip my spoon for a first bite. Flavor - an explosion on my tongue. Reaching for the tortilla, I am pleased to find it fresh and soft and warm. I take small bites, eating slowly. Long, intentioned breaths in through the nose between these bites help to enhance the rich experience. I relish every taste until it's gone.

Putting an arm up on the railing to my left, I take a final sip of beer and look around. The afternoon is a set off some new feature me and all these others chose to act in. A car passes lethargically. Edges of a sign across the street flicker slightly in the wind. Bits of conversation like an auditory chaff trickle past me. I gather my book and keys, and then I leave.

CONCLUSION

Although pricey, Market Street Kitchen does not disappoint. My total meal came to just over $21. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent. The ambiance was equally impressive - it calls to you from the street. I would highly recommend this for a more upscale experience, be it a date or a work lunch. (That said, I quite enjoyed my solo visit as well!)

If you haven't yet been by for a visit, find a way to get here if you can. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

"My friend invited me out to lunch today. It was my first time trying pho since I usually stick to ramen. We got to pick where we sat. It's a small place but you just have to know what the right times to come in are. 

They only have Pepsi products.. Don't say that no one warned you! Their menu is very simple which is best when trying something new so it wasn't too overbearing for me! 

I tried the fried wontons and the #1 without the cow stomach (it had a weird name?) The wontons were crispy and very good! It needed just a pinch of salt but then again, I always add too much salt to things as it is. It came in 4 pieces. It was $3.25 from what I remember. The pho comes in two different sizes. The regular is big but the large is huge! The large alone is enough to take home extras. The regular size is about 8.99. It's a fair price in my book! The broth is very light (keep in mind it's my first time trying pho) and I actually loved it. I added some salt (duh), soy sauce (I swear I'm going to die from high blood pressure) and Sriracha to it and it was just perfect. I don't really enjoy the noodles as much, but I loved the broth and beef so much. I think it was actually my favorite part! It also comes with a huge plate full of bean sprouts and limes so you can put as little or much as you'd like. 

I should also add that they're very friendly here. It's a hidden gem right behind the Canes and In N Out on Rock Springs!

"Supercuts is my usual spot for an eyebrow wax - partially because I'm too broke to go anywhere else. Surprisingly, they do a decent job....most of the time. It all really depends on who I get that day, and since I haven't exactly found a master Supercuts waxer that I'm attached to, I just leave it up to fate. My skin is very sensitive to waxing, and they actually do a very good job at minimizing the redness and irritation. My one complaint is that 9 times out of 10, they'll forget to wax a part of my eyebrow and seem annoyed when I point it out. First off, highly unprofessional. Second, shouldn't the one with the messed up eyebrow be the one that's mad??",1.0

"I've been here a handful of times recently, and this place is pretty decent for a simple, family dinner. Probably not the type of place you'd want to be at, for a lavish, impressive meal though. Keep in mind that they only open for dinner and late night, so don't come by around lunchtime hoping for a bite!

They have dozens of menu items (all in Chinese unfortunately) posted all around the restaurant, so I'd highly recommend you check those out, since they tend to be newer, seasonal, and more unique dishes (e.g. stuffed shrimp and fish maw in deep fried tofu with a side of veges). Their menu booklet itself does have some variety with the typical meat, seafood, noodles, rice, soup, etc. and on the last page, they usually have specials for around $7.99 which is a very good deal! 

Their portion sizes are very large, so I'd recommend taking a look at the other customers' dishes before deciding how many plates to order, but generally, for dishes that aren't specials (aka dishes that aren't $7.99), they will come with a side of vegetables piled high. Personally, I've only had the typical meat and vegetables dishes here, not the seafood ones, since their seafood doesn't seem to be that fresh. I have seen plenty of tables here order seafood dishes or hotpot, so I'm guessing that those are fairly solid options too.

Last note, they are almost always at full capacity every night during peak dinner times (6-8pm), so if you plan to come during that time, I would highly recommend you make a reservation beforehand!",1.0
"******SAVE YOURSELF MONEY*****

This has been by far the worst facility I have ever encountered. Please save yourself time and your money! It seems to good to be true, they give you a low rate for monthly payments. Do not be fooled by this! Every two months the prices go up ten bucks. When i first started my payments were only 50$, towards the end of my stay it was up to 83 bucks a month. Not worth it. Also, when i had called to inform them I was leaving the unit. I took everything with me including the lock. A month later i received an invoice from them saying i needed to pay. I contacted them about this and they told me that a lock was still on there. LIES!!! I have the lock to my unit in my hand! AS THIS GUY IS LYING TO ME! he told me i still had to pay because this is still my responsibility. I told him he obviously gave the unit to someone else because i have the lock on me. I told him i would even show pictures because i have evidence it is from their company because it has their Sticker on it! He told me i could send whatever picture i wanted and that he didnt care? Excuse me? What kind of customer services is this. I then informed him that i will be getting lawyers involved because i am not paying for a unit that is no longer mine and a shady company whom obviously is scamming me! He said to do whatever I wanted because i hung up on him earlier and Yes i did! This place is outrageous.

Frustrated, I went into this retail location and this gentleman researched the issue and saw the resolution through to the end, and made and extra effort to make sure I got paid back everything that I deserved, since the call center person was not willing to refund the shipping costs even though I had been shipped a defective phone. He was also very friendly during the whole process.

"Location is good, wish the management and ownership were. Expect this place to raise rent every lease term for an old building with pest problems, loud neighbors and inefficient staff and management. I have lived here four years and it has gone downhill. Teenagers and kids (I am a parent btw) tend to climb fences, run over buildings and walls with non-existent parents. Alliance management is HORRIBLE, paint up buildings while doing nothing to improve inside of apartments. Want roaches? They're here. I heard they had a rat problem across the street. I love this location but can't stand the poor management of Alliance. Behind this complex is Sierra with a lot of crime. PP has had car break-ins, problems with rain and flooding in apartments, mold problems. The corridor has a lot of foot traffic and unknowns. Kids have to be monitored all the time. If you're young twenties it could be great for you but not good for a small family. These units are old and very loud!  You will hear everything upstairs and downstairs. Mailboxes have been broken into twice. After being here 4 years, will not renew my lease.

"I made an appointment with the dentist for an exam and tooth cleaning- a 2 hour span! They bombarded me with phone text messages to confirm (5x)-which I answered yes to- as well as at least 2 calls. I get there, fill out extensive forms (that's normal), and I am ushered into a room with a table, where I have a discussion not with the dentist but an associate (was she a dental hygienist? I can't say) and we discuss my dental experiences of the last several years. The dentist comes in after 15 or 20 minutes, introduces himself, and we go over the same ground I just discussed with the associate, thus eating another 15 minutes. He states that although it's a 2 hour appointment, I may not get the tooth cleaning today because we are already 40 minutes into the appointment time. I can also say he didn't smile at me once. Was quite dour, was it because I mentioned that I had just had a bad experience with a different dentist, who knows. The point is , if you are a new patient, a good dentist makes them feel at ease-not just the opposite. Now I am not a nervous patient, at the dentist I had before moving to Madison, were wonderful and I stayed with them for many years. Having a warm smile-just some warmth, helps one feel better about a first dental appointment. After realizing that I wouldn't get any of the work done I had hoped to for that day (not even a tooth cleaning), I said that I thought this wasn't going to work out and left. I got the feeling they were eating up time in that room to charge for a two hour appointment-when I could have said everything to the dentist in about 5 minutes, had he joined us from the start and I was in a dental chair, not sitting at a table. I notice there are a lot of 5 star ratings on Yelp and that's why I made the appointment but I neither felt comfortable with this unsmiling, stiff man, nor making a long appointment and being told that I wouldn't get a tooth cleaning that day. I'm sure he is a kind guy once you get to know him, but this first sit down was an experience I will not soon forget.

"Let me start by saying that I like Steve, Emma & Rich on a personal level.  Emma is an absolute sweetheart.  

My customer experience was very disappointing and want you to know that it would be FOOLISH on your part to consider taking a vehicle to Brooks Racing to be worked on.  My car needed the engine's rotating assembly rebuilt and I wanted a supercharger added.  The initial estimate was that the process would take 3 months and cost $5,967.  After waiting FOURTEEN months and paying Brooks Racing over $20,000 plus much more on parts.  The car was not running right and was overheating badly.  Let me say again....they had the car for 14 months and although I would call and follow up each week, it would often sit and sit with no work being done.  I paid them promptly each time they gave me an invoice in hopes that they would take care of me but still customer service was atrocious.  After I learned that they were getting evicted from their location and had actually moved my car to the new location I knew I needed to take my car to somebody else.  I am very grateful to Emma for recommending another company that is doing good work for me. 

I could write chapters about the saga I endured but I'll keep things simple:
* There is little or no pride in workmanship
* They do not see things through
* Customer Service is a foreign concept
* They don't use a calendar and plan their work  
* They ignored dozens of phone calls, texts and emails over the 14 month ordeal
* When I was expecting a $2,500 bill they surprised me with a 11,000 bill.  
* The fabrication work done on my car was poor.  The welding skills are feeble.
* My car sat under a swamp cooler for many months causing surface rust to some parts
* Various wires and cables were melted and or severed
* They are very good at making excuses


I have payed thousands to have the shoddy work performed by Brooks Racing repaired by a competent and conscientious shop including:
* Replacing the ""custom fabricated"" Cold Air Intake with something that seals to the throttle body and fits in the car
* Plumbing the intercooler coolant system as the system didn't flow when I got the car which was part of the cause to the overheating
* Replacing the engine support.  Brooks had taken the 4"" box metal cross member and hacked a huge chunk out of and tack welded a little hollow  3\/4"" pipe in it's place
* Repairing the fuel system lines



I tried to schedule to have my car professionally towed to the new shop and Brooks INSISTED on transporting it for me.  Unfortunately they used a 5th wheel trailer which didn't work well for my low slung Italian car.  When Brooks Racing delivered it they ended up tearing off the fuel lines while unloading it.  I'm deeply troubled by the number of scratches, scrapes and gouges that are now on my car after they had it for a year and two months.  My car was in nearly new condition with just 11,000 miles on it when I took it to them.    

Another crazy thing is that Rich the Mechanic called me after I had gotten my car back and asked me for more money.  He said he spent a six of hours ""diagnosing"" the intercooler system and wanted to get paid.  I asked him what his diagnosis was and he said that the cooler was blocked.  UGH!!!   Six hours to figure that out?  I explained that I had paid every invoice I received and was not interested paying any more.  I told him that I had paid him to install the system PROPERLY once and he failed.  I should have to pay him again for diagnosing it.

"This place is consistently awesome. Taco Tuesdays is my jam! You have to get their original style tacos but I promise they never fall short in flavor. Original style consists of corn tortillas, a meat of your choice, onions, cilantro, and slices of radish. Beef tongue and chorizo tacos are so good and for $1 a pop, you can't beat it; not to mention chips and salsa once you sit down. They bring out three different salsas to go with your uh-mazing tacos and they're all delish. Let's not forget a $2.50 can of Tecate to top off the meal. 

The service is also great! Their usual waiter, Raul, is the BEST! He's so nice, always has a smile and is very attentive with the diners! He really makes the dining experience worthwhile. 

Overall this place is the best bang for your buck in the area and you'll definitely never go wrong on Tuesdays.",1.0
"Omg!! I walked in there and was in HEAVEN!!
The smell of fresh baked sweets was incredible! 
I really wanted to take a little bit of everything home. However, I controlled myself and we ended up taking a piece of the yum yum and the oreo pie.
I hate to admit this but, I inhaled the yum yum. The cream cheese frosting was so good!
The carrot cake was moist and full of raisins, walnuts, pineapple and some other incredibly tasty things.
My husband loved the oreo pie, it was light and fluffy. Not too overly sweet.
However! He liked the yum yum better. Lol!
So, I highly highly recommend the yum yum!

"In terms of facilities space and equipment, the gym gets a 4.  But the quality of the class instructors and the helpfulness of the support staff downgrades the overall rating to a 2.  I signed up for the cycling classes and having taken classes across the US at Soulcycle,  Brick Bodies, other major chains, the classes here are the worst.  Repetitive, no upper body movement, and constant screaming from the instructors.  A louder voice doesn't make for a better class.  It's a shame, considering they have one of the best stadium seating cycling facilities I've been to.  If they hired some decent instructors, build up a reputation, they can easily charge by the class.  Overall, would not renew contract because the classes are bad and I have gym equipment at home.",1.0

Leave it to my trusty Yelp app to steer me to this cute place.  What looks like a home from the street turns into a combo mini store and restaurant once you pull open the door.

In the store part, you can find different sundries like toothpaste and toilet paper, razors (perfect as my friend forgot to pack his) and cleaning supplies.  Reminds me of the old general store concept where you could get pretty much anything you needed and a bite to eat!

Moving past the front, we were warmly greeted by Katerina who told us to ""sit anywhere"" and ""she would take care of us""!  And she did.  We felt like we were guests in her home.

After taking our orders, she delivered them to Tom in the back who quickly began preparing our food and while it was cooking, we got to learn about her, her family and the Toronto area.  And just when we thought we had made a new friend, our food was up and Tom the chef (owner?) was there sharing hockey stories and making us feel like really valued guests, too so it was a special experience.

As for the food,it was really good.  I went with the omelette special which on this day was feta and spinach and my friend had the Denver omelette which was chock full of veggies and peppers.  It comes with your choice of bread and home made french fries which were also quite tasty!  If you want a soda, you pull it from the cooler that is right there or have a cup of their coffee which is promptly refilled.  And I think my breakfast was about $11 and Katerina told me if I had gotten up earlier, it was only $8.95 or something before10!  Crazy, right? (guess I'll always be paying the higher price as this girl likes to sleep in on weekends!)

This restaurant knows everyone in the neighborhood as people were coming in and ordering their ""usuals"" time and time again.  And the nicest part is you can sit and linger if you want or get in and get out.  It's your choice.

So the next time you are in the area looking for good food at a great price served by people who really make you feel special, check out the Scollard Deli.  It's not fancy, but you'll leave feeling full and really good about meeting some great people who believe that the customer definitely comes first!  Thanks Tom and Katerina for making our day!",1.0

"Originally we went in due to a positive yelp rating. Went for lunch on a Sunday. Both my girlfriend and I were very disappointed. Here is the story:

Downtown Scottsdale was super busy. There was hardly anywhere to park, yet we were the only ones in this place. We both felt uneasy walking in when we saw the place was empty, but decided to take the risk. 

The place looks cool, and it might be fine for drinks at night. It has a New Orleans feel to it. However, the server was more focused on keeping the empty, already clean bar pristine than anything else. We had to initiate the greeting after waiting about a minute for her attention. During our stay another couple walked in, hung around for 30 seconds and left because no one acknowledged them. 

There didn't seem to be any pride in the food. While the menu seemed okay, and the food appeared modern in its plating the taste was very bland. I ordered my burger medium and it came out well done. The veggies were definitely not sourced well, because they had nearly no flavor. 

Amanda's Catfish po'boy was 1 color between the fish, the bread and even the veggies; Again, very dull in flavor. After leaving we discovered there was a happy hour that no one bothered to tell us about. 

Shame on us for going into an empty place. We drove home feeling like we missed an opportunity. My guess is that this place has some investors, but no investment in a chef. If they did they would be hustling to get people in the door on a very busy Sunday instead of sweeping already clean floors.",1.0
"I was killing time before a Dr.'s appointment and happened to find this place. Located in Henderson at Pecos and Wigwam in the strip mall area closest to Wigwam.  They carry a variety of breads, bagels and snacks.

The service, wines and food, from 131 Main, make for a perfect go to spot. If you want to stop in for a drink and appetizer it is perfect. I love the smoked salmon with toasts starter. The service is always on point, and sometimes they have live music which makes for a perfect evening.

One minor irritation is that they say they ground the meat in-house, yet they do not allow to have it cooked to order (ie-cannot choose to have it rare, med-rare etc).  In some ways this defeats the whole point of grinding the meat in-house and I think there is something up with that as it didn't quite add up to me.

So we decided to split the CORDUROY BURGER*Harris ranch beef, Boursin cheese smoked ketchup, piquillo peppers,arugula, crispy leeks, sesame bun. Great burger. Beef was tender and the cheese was bitter but in a good way. The burger came with crispy French Fries.

I've since seen 2 different dermatologist one through ins and one I paid for Bc I was afraid to be brushed off again. Both agreed something is definitely wrong. I had a skin biopsy taken and was given two prescriptions to help with possible infections or parasites and for inflammation or if I develop any itching and was told ""don't worry we will get to the bottom of this and get you better"". I work in medicine and I am educated, but regardless I am a patient and no patient should EVER be treated so poorly. He told me I was ""crazy"".

"I have been a patient of Dr. Caldron for over 15 years.  I have received infusions for all of that time and his practice has received in excess of $500,000 in payments from my insurance co and myself.  BCBS denied further infusions because I was not taking another medication that was required in order for the infusions to not be considered experimental.  At no time was I told I had to take the two medications by Dr. Caldron to prevent the treatment from being experimental. The infusion medication was extremely successful and I very rarely felt the pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis.

Furthermore, they made a mistake sending us a juice that we didnt order and when I said I didnt order it they refused to take it off the bill.
Needless to say I was completely ticked off by then and just wanted to leave. NOT HAPPY.

Common, it is 2016 and 99% of people do not carry cash on them! nevermind it's about 15 cents per transaction. 
The only reason they dont take cards is because the owners of this restaurant either skip the cash register and keep most of cash without paying taxes or they just want to make an extra $2 from the money machine downstairs. 
That is not the kind of restaurant I want to give business to.",1.0
"Being a Food Network Star, I have to say the meal prepared by the chef was awesome, the escargot was poached to perfection, the Barbecue shrimp with the biscuit was amazing and to finish it off the BBQ salmon was just what I needed to finish this meal off the service from the wait staff was on point even with our large party of 15 I will definitely give this restaurant 10 Stars there are so many items on the menu you have to try if you are ever in Vegas this is a must Dine!",1.0

"Value and great cakes.  What else do you need from a breakfast diner.  Fast they are not, but again, they are short ordering your requests a few at a time.  Friendly and attentive with the coffee refills. Potatoes were good, with skins on them traditional style. Also had the Banana Can pancakes and they were serious and heavy, the way they should be.   I will return to this location soon.",1.0
"Avoid this place at all costs. I got sick while traveling for work and my insurance recommended going here because they are covered in network for me  and would only cost me my copay (plus more if additional services were rendered). A few weeks later and the clinic is trying to charge me more for not credible reason. Even my insurance company is telling me this place is not billing properly and attempting to collect more than needed.  All they did was look at an infection and put me on antibiotics. That's it. No poking around, no tests, nothing.  The doctor who saw me was subpar.  He tried to diagnose me before even asking more questions or taking a through look at the situation.  My general doctor in Texas was shocked and appalled when I explained what I'm going through with this place. I have visited several clinics (due to work sending me to several states) and not one has attempted to collect more and make excuses like this clinic. The billing department is a joke. She doesn't even know what she is doing or talking about which is very disappointing.  She is rude over the phone and maybe she doesn't realize it... but she needs to be trained to talk to customers over the phone.  She clearly lacks phone etiquette and insurance billing knowledge. 

I highly suggest you look else where. It's not worth the headache of dealing with billing department. I'd give it zero stars if I could.",1.0
This location is a hidden treasure. One of the greatest things about this store is that it exudes that sense of family. I haven't tried any of the food as of yet but my first impressions instantly made me want to write about this location. The gentleman working the register was cordial and you don't feel rushed when paying for your merchandise. I like smaller family run businesses. These businesses keep intact the very origins\/staple of our society. I'd recommend this store to anyone that is looking for a place with fair prices and that Mom and Pops store feeling.,1.0

"Came here on a Monday night for Winterlicious. My gf booked that day and got the last reservation for 7pm. Every seat in the house had a butt in it when we got there.

I got the mixed green salad, prime rib and tiramisu. My girlfriend got the crab cakes, prime rib and apple crumble. Timing for bread and salads were great. I've gotten the mixed green salad here before and became a fan of it. The dressing they use is really tasty, so I was excited for this. Totally finished the salad. My gfs crab cakes were just ok. You get two kinda small cakes. After the starters is where it went downhill. We waited 30 minutes + for our entrees! Even the table next to us got their food first and they were a group of four that came AFTER us! I had to ask our waitress what was taking so long and she said the kitchen got really busy. Uhhh??? Really, not a good excuse. Anyways when the food DID finally come out, it was actually really good. My gf and I both got our prime ribs done medium rare. Both were juicy and tender. I just wished they had regular mashed potatoes because their wasabi infused mash is disgusting. That's why I had to opt for a bake potato this time. Which was alright I guess. Came with all the fixings.

Dessert followed within a reasonable time. Would never get the tiramisu again. It's basically a cup of cream with bits of cake here and there. There really weren't any layers to it. Apple crumble was only good because of the ice cream.

I had a better winterlicious experience here last year (I think) but this particular time they only earned themselves 3 stars. I'm not going to lie though, they do a good prime rib.",1.0

Maintenance response time is fastest I've dealt with in the last five years of different apartment complexes. Very social and friendly neighborhood; food trucks and community events.

I usually come here on Wednesday's for their Randall (they infuse one of their beers with some other yummy ingredients)--I just recently had their pale ale with persimmons, dates and currants and it was so tasty! The food truck out back (Fire & Forged) cooks up some amazing, fresh food and switches up their menu frequently. The back patio is beautiful and dog-friendly.

They have fresh cactus (if they could remove the turns would be great!), cambray onions (perfect for bbq), avocados, fresh cream, panela cheese; lots of Mexican supplies you can order by season.

Although I haven't tasted their food, the restaurant section looks folkloric: cashier at the entrance, piñatas, Spanish spoken.

"I really wanted to like this place. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and while the ambience was great, they really need to work on customer service. The night started out great, but 20 minutes into our dinner, our waitress disappeared. She never came back to tell us she left for the night and that another person was going to wait her tables. This particular waiter was nice, but not very attentive. Our food came out really slow at this point, and then they forgot one order and got another one wrong.

Terrible.

We've been to a handful of other AYCE Korean BBQ places, and while the food here wasn't bad, it wasn't the greatest either. The portions were smaller and the appetizers not very appetizing. May be if the waiters were more attentive at helping customers, I would have had a better experience.

In fact, there were more workers cleaning tables and changing grills than there were employees waiting tables.

I sure as hell ain't hard to please. Great customer service goes a long way for me and I was sorely disappointed with the service and the night overall. My wife wasn't as critical of this place as I am, but she also wasn't happy.",1.0
"Great little place. Came here for a quick bite, and we ordered the TMC Croissant and the French Toast. I didn't know the french toast was made from Pannattone bread (which i'm not a fan of), but it was still very well made - alot of fresh fruit on top. The TMC croissant is where it's at! Simple but delicious. Coffee was delish.",1.0
"This evening we dined for my husband's birthday.  Even though I noted it in our reservation, no one asked if we were celebrating anything this evening.  Not a big deal though.   Next, the waiter was courteous, and did a decent job.  The restaurant had a nice atmosphere, as well, but we will not be returning in the future.  We got the Shrimp Alexander appetizer, which we both loved, but that was the only thing we really liked.   As far as dinner goes, my shrimp capellini was just ok.  My husband got the veal chop and did not like it.  He ordered it well-done but it was rare a few bites in.  He ended up leaving a lot of the expensive dinner on the plate.  Further, the waiter referred to the veal chop as a pork chop two times, which made my husband feel uneasy throughout the night, and put a psychological damper on his meal because he cannot eat pork.  An innocent slip on the waiter's part, I'm sure, but it was just the icing on the proverbial cake of a lackluster, but super pricey dinner.   We also asked for lemons for his salad, but the lemons were a bit dehydrated.  The sour cream mashed potatoes were okay by me, but my husband didn't like them at all.  Overall, we give it a thumbs-down.",1.0
Had the Magic Shrooms burger with Green Chile Queso with Fries while Tim had the Bacon Cheeseburger. My burger rocked; delicious; juicy; and very flavorful. Tim wasn't as impressed with his. He said the meat wasn't very flavorful. The Green Chili Queso Fries are awesome. Definitely recommend getting those if you go. And since we went during Happy Hour the price was just right.,1.0
"Strap on your grippy shoes and shake out your noodly arms. It's time to climb, jump, and play your way to a better body! This ""gym"" is honestly the most fun I've ever had at any gym. I didn't see any deadlift platforms or smith machines, but what it does have is one hell of an adult playground! (not that kinda adult playground ;) )

Pursuit OCR is, for a lack of better word, awesome. It's beautiful (look at those colour-changing lanterns) and every inch is filled with something interesting. In addition to the obstacle course, there are hanging ropes, chains, and gym equipment for people to use (or try to use) for just $20. They also have classes and some sort of cryogenic sauna room. Yes, freezing yourself CAN BE healthy!

Onto the obstacle course itself, it actually wasn't bad at all! This is coming from someone who is terrified of heights. Seriously, I can't even go on top of monkey bars. But what I do have is an easy time succumbing to peer pressure. And with a little bit of motivation, I was able to pretty much do the entire course. It's always comforting to know that the course is designed so that you can bypass any part you don't want to do. 

And of course, there's the infamous wall. Do your best to run up that thing and feel like a ninja. Or, flop over on your bum and slide down. Everyone will cheer you on anyways. Patrons and staff alike were very helpful and encouraging. It's like being among friends. 

While I loved this place, I'm not sure how many times I can be back. Having run through the course 3x completely, it got a little predictable. My more flexible and daring friend actually wanted a more challenging course. Maybe in the future, there will be expansions. 

Regardless, if you want to increase your strength, improve your flexibility, and conquer your fear of heights, this is a fantastic place to do it. Jump to the sky and reach for the stars! Or fall in the ball pit. Either way, you'll have fun!

"Hmmmm honestly not sure what the hype is about... I'm from LA and whenever I tell people I'm making a trip to Vegas, I always get a ""You HAVE to try Shake Shack!"" So I had to try Shake Shack :P The food was good, the prices not so good..
I got the Shack Stack ($9.59) and crinkle cut fries ($2.99)  while my boyfriend got the single All Shook Up frozen custard with mix-ins ($4.59) and the Shack-Cago Dog ($4.25). My friend got the single ShackBurger ($5.29). My burger was pretty good- the fried mushroom stuffed with melted cheese was definitely my favorite part of the burger! However, I finished it real quick and was still hungry for more.. their burgers are pretty small for $10 :\/ I expect a burger at that price to fill me up. My boyfriend thought his hotdog was okay (came with a pickle, cucumber, onions, tomatoes and relish) and would've rather paid $1.50 for a more filling and equally tasty hotdog at Costco haha. My friend also thought the ShackBurger was tiny and rather pricy, for such a simple burger. Their fries however were pretty good- texture: crispy & crunchy!

Tried the Beef Kebob Teka which was really flavorful and cooked on a kebob and came with this rice side that was really good.  Mild, suble taste but the raisins (I think) gave it a unique flavor!

Also had the Boolani vegetable pancake which came with unlimited Avocado sauce.  It was a little spicy but loving avocados, it was fine.  

And lastly had the Mantu vegetable dumpling.  It's usually beef but they said they could prepare it vegie which was really good!  The dumplings sat in a curry type sauce which reminded me of Thai curry not not quite.

"Great place to eat and catch an amazing view.  We made reservations for a party of 17 about two weeks in advance and these guys were great.  I dealt with Donny on the phone and ""Team Kevin"" (waiter and assistant were both named Kevin). Everything that was put in front of us was amazing...apps, soups, salad, mains and dessert.  Everything was perfectly cooked, flavorful and well presented.  It's not easy to accommodate a large party, but these guys did it.  If you spent all your time reading reviews on where you should or shouldn't go, you'd never do anything.  This place was ""Old School Vegas"" all the way, I loved it.  I'd give 5 Stars in a second, but there was a problem with the A\/C so it was a little warm, (we had a few pre-menopausal women in the party...they don't like a warm room).  The only other critique that I'd make, was the lack of music. I like a little ""background music"" for dinner ambiance.  Kevin said they usually have it on, but didn't that night for some reason.  Anyway, go check this place out, take the waiters recommendations (a good waiter won't steer you wrong), feel the rich history, enjoy the incredible view and taste wonderful food in an atmosphere of a different time in this cool Vegas Steakhouse.    

One last thing I forgot to mention...since we had a large party, the tip was already included in the bill.  I didn't see it, (a few glasses of wine, and 46 year old eyes), I tipped on top of the tip, (by a lot of money),  Kevin caught it before we left and he refused to ""keep it"".

It seems to be very clean and the cooks are very friendly. A bit pricier than your average shawarma\/doner place. Overall Great food, service & price kind of dims it down.

I was impressed with the desserts, though.

I like to sit where I want and be able to move if I want. First come first serve. I can see it maybe for busy nights and premieres, but if I'm going to a movie at 10am on a Sunday morning when it's not busy and spending good money on a ticket and concessions, I should be able to sit where the heck I want.

"Located in a plaza, the surprisingly large interior with high ceilings feels crafty, bright, and family-friendly. We stopped by around 7:00 pm on a Sunday, hoping to get another taste of the delicious ribs and brisket I had at a recent catered event by them. Beware, the specials and popular items go quick, especially on a nice day. Since they smoke meats in limited quantities, everything I planned to order was out by the time we arrived. Bummer! 

But when life hands you lemons, you channel your inner Beyonce. I went for their pulled pork and catfish entree instead, and I need to express to the Internet how amazing their catfish is. It is zero fishiness, juicy on the inside, crispy, fluffy, and salty on the outside. It didn't need the tarter sauce that came with it. Not normally a huge catfish fan, I would not hesitate to recommend this one to any fish eater, or order this one myself again. 

I was disappointed by their BBQ sauces though, what had been great at the event I attended, now tasted much too sweet on my pulled pork -- I'm not sure if they're working with a different recipe or what -- so I took my pork to go and it made great next-day leftovers with the TJ's BBQ sauce I had at home. 

Two sides come with your entree, and I chose the mac n cheese and coleslaw. As a lover of cafeteria mac n cheese, their cheese-saucey version with large corkscrew macaroni worked great. What was crunchy fresh coleslaw at the catered event I attended tasted more like its store-bought cousin in-house, but my partner loved it. 

Their key lime pie is a generous slice for $5, definitely a nice finish to a meal split between two or more people.

Yes, they have *ahem* improved the centre. There is an brand new NHS Dental Clinic - (much needed for some local 'benchers') and Greggs the Baker has opened a shop.

"I came here with a friend on an early Saturday evening.  I was shocked that they were already full at 5ish.  I thought people in TO didn't start eating till 7ish.  Guess I was wrong, guess they eat 24\/7.  

Anyways, I ordered the pulled ""pork"" banh mi with sesame fries, and the beet apple ginger juice.  The pulled pork had great flavour but not overly sweet or BBQish so if you like eating comfort food but with a less strong flavour, then I'd recommend it (this is actually a compliment - sometimes I find places douse the places with too much sauce). The fries were great too.  

The beet apple ginger juice had a good mix sweetness with ginger flavour. I loved it.  

While this place is pretty small and they get busy quickly, the service was still great.  

Also, a lot of vegan places are over-priced (even though it'd be cheaper to make than meat based dishes), however for the venue, it was very reasonable. I paid about $16 before tip which is not bad.

"I've been to a handful of haunted houses in the Phoenix area but this was my first time at the 13th floor. I went opening night with a group of around 10 people. I arrived a little before 7 and didn't get into the haunted house until well after 9. Not even that long of a line, they just wanted to make sure there was plenty of spacing between each group. I understand, but still a little annoying. 
It took us a little over 30 minutes to complete both of the houses. My mind was seriously blown by the sets. By far the most impressive I've ever seen. The scares were good but once you've been in for so long you start to become desensitized to them. My biggest complaint was that it was sooo hot inside. It felt at well over 100 degrees. It kind of took away from the experience for me and all I could think about was just getting out into the cooler air. Like I said, it was my first time going so I'm not sure if it's always so hot in there but I really hope it's not.

"Be aware! This place is very poorly managed. I have been a resident here for 3 years. -During my stay I had ongoing problems with my AC it was broken EVERY summer. The AC is old and can't keep up with the heat. -Not to mention the ongoing cockroach problem in the apartment units. -During the last Phoenix open I was only provided with 1 parking pass and this forced me to pick up my parents from the nearby Starbucks's parking lot, since they couldn't drive in. The place is hard to access or leave during the TPC...be aware! -The pool is constantly closed every two weeks, and this summer it was closed for renovation for almost 6 weeks, seriously this should be scheduled for the winter not the hottest month of the summer. -They hired one of the ex-military resident from the complex to lock down the pool every night, well officially the pool hours are Mon-Thursday till 11pm, and the rest of the weekend till midnight. This gentleman many time showed up 30-40 min before closing and forced people to leave the pool in a very intimidating fashion, while having guest, kids, or making dinner... Not to mention many nights he didn't show up at all, so people were partying all night and I couldn't sleep or get ready for work. -The sauna is constantly broken, so as the front gate. It is advertised as a gated community! The management is changing every 6 months. They never handle anything with urgency, and it seems they are doing a favor by attending to maintenance requests after 20-30 days...

"BEWARE Embrace! IMO, very shady company -- watch out for totally bogus claim denials.

Embrace is hands down the worst insurance company I have ever dealt with -- and Im a retired health care attorney with years of experience navigating claims. 

Here's just one example: Last August (2015) we took our dog to the vet b\/c she was vomiting -- maybe ate something toxic? When we submitted our claim to Embrace, they indicated we no longer had a policy with them. I figured it had lapsed -- assumed that was our mistake.

But when I learned monthly premiums were still being deducted from our bank, I called to clarify. Was told -- Oh yeah, that's right, you DO have a policy -- yeah, our prior communication was confusing....

So did Embrace then immediately pay for the august vet's visit? Nope. Embrace refused to pay -- claimed her vomiting was due to a ""pre-existing condition."" And what was their basis for saying her august 2015 vomiting was caused by a ""pre-existing condition?"" Well, the medical records show that she had actually vomited once before -- A YEAR BEFORE -- in August of 2014.  

Yep. Embrace asserts that if a dog is treated for vomiting in August 2015, they can  refuse to pay --  calling it a ""preexisting condition""   --solely  because that dog had vomited --  ONCE --  12 MONTHS EARLIER.

Of course I asked what disease or ""pre-exisinting condition"" could possibly make an animal vomit once-every-12-months ---   of course the Embrace claims rep had no answer. Just another standard attempt to get away with non-payment of valid claims....

"Was craving breakfast, looked on Yelp, and discovered that my hotel was just a few minutes away from a Bruxie. I went with a few other friends and ordered their buffalo bleu waffle sandwich. My friends tried the crispy chicken (I think that's what it's called), one of the breakfast sandwiches, and a caesar salad. The pricing was fair considering it's more of a ""specialty"" type of food. The sandwich was about $10. The food came out really fast in less than 10 minutes. 

The portion size is huge, I had difficulty finishing the whole thing. The chicken was crispy and juicy, really really good. I love buffalo sauce and I really enjoyed the sauce on the buffalo bleu. The coleslaw was just okay, a bit flavorless. I was expecting a bit more creamyness from the slaw to balance out the tangyness from the buffalo sauce. The first half of my sandwich was really good, but when I got to my second half it got to be too much. All you could taste was the strong buffalo sauce. Maybe it would be a good idea to get the buffalo sauce on the side? Regardless, this chicken and waffle combo really hit the spot. The waffle was light and crispy and did not get soggy at all. The waffle held up pretty well, which I was surprised! We ordered a side of waffle fries, which were pretty basic. I would skip on these.

Usually I just poke those two side nuisances around with my fork roughing up the edges, but I actually ate a decent amount of the rice.  I still passed on the beans.  

My tacos came out and the plate looked lovely.  It's not a huge portion, but good for lunch, however a little pricy about $9.00 for the two tacos.  Maybe I'm just cheap, I accept that.  They came with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo and a creamy chipotle sauce.  The combination of ingredients mixed with the fresh crispy fish was a winner.

I get that small businesses need to make money, but free refills are pretty standard fare and personally, I'd rather you charge me a bit more up front than to have to pay every time I want a refill. Also, their horchata was chalky like it was made from a powder\/mix. I didn't realize how huge the fry bread tacos were and made the mistake of ordering two of them. There was no chance I could even finish one, so ordering two was completely stupid. I did taste them both (one chicken, one beef) and the chicken was definitely the better one but their fry bread was extremely oily tasting and kind of salty. It was a bit of a turn off. Same with the homemade chips. Way too much salt. The taco filling was pretty decent but overall there was nothing that would make me want to come back.

I had the Angel Hair pasta with shrimp and vodka sauce.  It was ok.  The shrimp were perfect and the angel hair was good.  The sauce had WAY TOO MANY shallots and spices in it.  Shallots should be used in small doses.  My Dad had the sliders, which looked good and he enjoyed, but said they weren't really anything special.

"Sushi Way is my go-to neighborhood AYCE sushi bar. It may not have the best sushi all the time, but it satisfies my cravings and I'm always able to get in without having to wait 1-2 hours unlike Goyemon or Kaya. I believe lunch is $22 and dinner is $27. Like most AYCE sushi restaurants in Vegas, you get a few extra premium items with the dinner price such as the uni, oysters, sweet shrimp, as well as galbi and the screaming orgasm. They always have daily specials, which has always included a type of sashimi with jalapenos. In the past, this has included the super white tuna and yellowtail. 

The best things to order at Sushi Way include the nigiri and a few of the side dishes. I've never had a bad experience with any of the fish. I tend to stay away from the regular or specialty rolls as they usually have a ton of rice and cream cheese. However, if you are tempted to try one, they do offer half rolls. Some of my favorite side dishes include the coconut shrimp tempura (must order every visit), baked green mussels, bacon scallop skewer, and seaweed salad. Of the specialty rolls, I've only tried a few variations of the soft shell crab for fun. 

Their dessert menu includes green tea ice cream, yuzu sorbet, mochi, tempura ice cream, and honey bread. I usually stick to the green tea ice cream or strawberry mochi. The tempura becomes complete mush and the yuzu sorbet is too icey. Don't forget to check-in on the Yelp app for a free soda.

I was super disappointed. Another time I went I was waiting at the counter for 5 minutes because the cashier was too busy on his phone and was completely ignoring me. I really don't get why it's always so busy in there. There are way better restaurants near by. Only reason I used to go was because it's the only halal place near by. Will definitely not go ever again. 
P.S. if you are in the area go to Moroccan Paradise right next to Curry Corner. AMAZING and halal",1.0
"Visit was for a Saturday, patio was full even for a late lunch so we sat at the small bar.  Service was slow, portions were small for the price, more of an appetizer than a meal not a great value..however the food was good and the red salsa had a great smokey flavor..need to see if they sell that by the bottle.",1.0

"We stopped by the Living Room tonight (6:30pm) for a bite to eat. The restaurant looked it was a little more than 1\/2 full. We were greeted as soon as we walked up and was seated at a table. Cold water was poured for us within one minute. Our first waitress took our drink order, a draft beer and a cocktail, dropped them off and asked if we were ready to order. My wife ordered a chicken salad. I ordered the seared ahi tuna salad. The waitress did not write down order.  (Sounds like a great experience ... NOT )

Well this is where things started to go bad. When I ordered I had the seared ahi tuna salad, I asked for the tuna rare, add onions and dressing in the side. Our food runner dropped off the salads and said she will be our new waitress. After she walked away I went to grab my fork but there was no silverware on the table. We had to wait for her to bring us forks. I went to put pepper on my salad ......... you guessed it, no salt or pepper. 

My tuna was cold like it was stored in the refrigerator, not seared hot and served rare. I did get my dressing on the side but the greens were drenched in dressing. They did get the order right with added onions.

Oh.... let me tell you about the onions. When I got the bill I was charged $1.00 for added onions to my salad. Are you kidding me! When I paid my tab I told the waitress there was a mistake I was charged $1.00 for onions. She said she did not take our order but she would take it off the bill. I said ""you don't understand. I ordered the onions on my salad but you made a mistake by trying to charge me $1.00"". She looked confused but $1 was removed form my bill. 

So why 2 stars and not 1? The seared ahi tuna salad was very tasty. We may give the Living Room another try. Maybe for happy hour. Remember .... there are numerous restaurants in Ahwatukee. Check your bill before you pay and don't settle for sub par service or food.",1.0

"This is not about the service, but about the phone contact before even going. I called to ask about a repair & at first the lady was pleasant & quoted me $5 for a one nail acrylic repair. I told her I had a little fungus under a nail from a different bad salon. She then said abruptly, ""if it has fungus on it I won't even TOUCH IT!""  Amazed, I just said thank you & hung up. I'm thinking, a repair includes fungus, chips, whatever.  I was looking for a new upscale place to start doing my nails so I wouldn't GET this. But by her rude tone no way I'd ever go there now. She could have at least said, I'm sorry but we don't do that because... or we can't because of liability.... or something a little better than that.  Get a clue on how to talk to people lady. There is so much competition and I can go to Legacy Village & get better service & be talked down to by better people & at least get an explanation!",1.0
"Polished's pedicures happen in buckets, not salon chairs. The bucket does have some flower petals floating around in it, which is nice, but the water heats from a heating pad below the bucket, and I found both the size and temperature of the bucket to be uncomfortable. The chairs are akin to a shoeshine stand at the airport, and don't massage, which, in my opinion, is one of the bigger benefits of getting a pedicure.

The nail techs soak off the old gel instead of filing it off, which I really appreciate. It was one of the reasons I switched salons and tried Polished in the first place. The tech, Miranda, did a great job. She  was careful, attentive, thorough, and neat. Their gel manicures have a two-week guarantee, but mine started to peel at one week. I didn't go back, because...

The atmosphere in the salon was all-caps AWKWARD. And I all caps that because, for some ungodly reason, the woman whom I believe to be the salon owner was loudly going on and on about how much she likes Donald Trump and how much she dislikes Hillary Clinton. To each your own--but maybe you should SHUT UP about your politics for a) a more soothing atmosphere in a business that is catering to relaxation and pampering; and b) to not offend the sizable percentage of your clientele who may not agree with you.

But on this Sunday, July 3, 2016 there was an attendant at that  location who very racist and rude. I was hoping and praying that she was just having a bad day but when my son's friend needed to use the restroom while the others were waiting to check out, she made them stop checking out and waited for the friend to come out of the restroom  because she was not comfortable. She thought he was stealing and he had to go to the restroom to load his pockets!!! This entire ordeal has been very disappointing, and I told my kids to never patron that store ever again.",1.0
"Want to try something a little bit different? When I do, I head over to Chutney's for some savory and spicy indian and indoasian cuisine.  There are dishes here that are famliar favorites along with some dishes that have a more heavy indoasian take, that may not be available readily in the valley. 

There is a HUGE parking lot with bike parking as this restaurant is located in a strip mall.  The inside is rather large and includes a banquet hall for holiday parties and other occasion where one may rent the space out and have an event catered.  

The service was a little sparce in the begining, however I did come at the busy lunch hour.  There wasn't anyone to greet me when I came in, however within a few mins someone came out of the kitchen to check on the front of house and he welcomed me and showed me my seat. Lunch time offers a buffet with some appetizers (various fritters depending on the day and dosa) sambar, sauces and salad. They have several types of rice including and interesting fried rice that looks what you may get with chinese takeout, however the spice profile is more complex and similar to what you would get in a biryani. The offer several main dishes with familair faves like butter chicken & paneer masala and some indoasian treats like mushroom or baby corn maruchan. You really need to try this for your self, but for me its like two of my favorite types of food had a beautiful baby! I love the savory taste of the chinese inspired ingredients along with the myriad spices used in traditional indian cuisine. 

There is also Chai tea and dessert avialable. None have ever stood out at this location yet, but its nice that they have them at the end of the meal.

"Great Asian variety.  Cant be beat IMO. On weekends this place is usually packed, and for good reason, it's delicious. We ordered our ""Valentines Day"" take out of Chicken Pho-Ga, Shrimp Pad-Thai and the Fresh Spring Rolls.   The pho rivals some of the best we've had on the east coast.  Want it spicy? You can get it spicy.  Chocked full of noodles, meat, veggies, and jalapenos it's a meal in itself. Yum!  The Pad Thai had many large shrimp with a great balance of noodles and veggies and we have enough left over for lunch tomorrow.  The fresh spring rolls were nice and cool, the perfect temp.  Not rubbery either.  Stuffed full of fresh veggies and shrimp, as the name implies.

"The food is ok but the service is absolutely terrible. Recently I stopped by the restaurant with a party of 7 on a Friday night at 9 p.m. The restaurant was near empty and we inquired for a table but the host was extremely snobby and impatient. He told us there was a 1.5 hour wait even though there were at least three tables available that could accommodate us. When I asked to be put on the waiting list he rolled his eyes and said that he would only accept a waitlist for a party of 6. When I asked whether they could even seat 7, he again rolled his eyes that it's there was a pizzeria down the street that this restaurant was for a more intimate setting.

His explanation was perfectly reasonable but his tone was extremely condescending. This is Downtown Phoenix not LA and we certainly are not at a Michelin star restaurant.",1.0
I specifically came here just to order the trash can nachos but ended with that and a few more appetizers to go along with it. The trash can nachos were absolutely delicious.

The cold brew is no joke. This one will get your caffeine buzz going right away. The iced Kona coffee was good too, but not as strong. 

They also have specialty drinks and seasonal drinks. I really liked the cookie butter pumpkin spice latte. I love coconut! Between the almond joy and the coconut haupia latte, the latter was da bomb!

Coco puffs OMG. Better than Liliha. It's true! Liliha's coco puffs are just too soggy for me. Ono sweetz is perfection. 

My favorite dessert is Troy's creation the haupia bar, which is a coconut dessert that is really not too coconutty. The distinct three layers of crust, cream cheese, and haupia go together so well!

"I think this is the best buffet in Vegas and I've pretty much been to them all.  This buffet isn't about a huge variety but more the best quality of products...and oh it is the best.  Endless lobster tails, caviar, sushi, eggs Benedict, crab bisque, it's insane.  This is a seafood buffet for sure so if you don't like seafood this wouldn't be your spot.  Truffle mashed potatoes, crab legs and the most beautiful dessert display.  This is the priciest buffet that I've been to but it is worth it.  At $98 per person, I got my fills worth between the crab legs and topping it with caviar.  This brunch fills up for sure so make sure that you make a reservation or else you may not get in.  For some reason I feel like this buffet isn't as well known as the others and I'm not sure why.  Maybe they don't want to pay the price.

"Quelle déception lorsqu'on attend depuis des mois pour essayer un endroit et que l'on reçoit un piètre service, de quoi franchement vous passer l'envie de le suggérer et d'y retourner. Depuis des mois, je passe devant ce fameux bar à vins et je n'ai entendu que de bons commentaires alors j'avais peut-être des attentes un peu hautes, mais bon... L'accueil fut courtois, on nous a mis dans la section du 2e étage, le serveur est venu tout de suite nous voir afin de véifier si nous avions des questions sur le menu et prendre notre commande. Comme nous voulions différentes bouchées il nous a recommandé de séparer en 3 nos commandes: entrées, plats plus conséquents et desserts. Bonne idée non ? Et bien pas trop quand il faut attendre une heure entre les deux services, que personne ne passe nous voir, ne nous propose de verres d'eau et que l'on doit courir après le serveur pour un menu.... Vraiment une déception quant au service reçu. Quand j'ai fait part de mon mécontentement, le serveur s'est excusé à plusieurs reprises, puis me dit qu'il met un rush sur la nourriture.... EUH tu me niaises c'est pas déjà fait depuis belle lurette!! Bref, on crève de faim, dans un endroit vraiment charmant, avec un décor intimiste. Le serveur aurait pu faire un geste commercial pour se faire pardonner et pour nous donner envie de redonner à l'établissement une 2e chance. 
Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, on a vu mieux, on a vu plus original. Prix raisonnables, mais des portions assez minuscules. Côté goût je n'ai pas été impressionnée, le chorizo ne goûtait pas particulièrement bon et il était accompagné de légumes marinés simples (carrottes et autres). Le tartare de cerf était pas mal mais les chips en accompagnement archi grasses et salées. Le mini burger était tellement petit qu'on ne se rappelle même pas si c'est bon ou pas. Les churros quant à eux à la cannelle étaient très bons mais dommage que le chocolat qui l'accompagnait soit froid, cela se prend chaud de préférence.  
Donc on y va pour l'ambiance, pour le côté intime et chaleureux, mais on essaie d'avoir un meilleur serveur ou on prend son mal en patience.",1.0
"This undoubtedly has a great atmosphere, and I especially like the random decorations underneath the glass on the tables. 
I would give their regular burger two stars. Cold, plain bun, ashy patties. They have much better burgers on the menu, though, so order something with some more pizzaz to it. The fries are exceptional. Five stars, easily. 
I don't like how everything is so plain. Sure, it's good food, but it's too normal for my liking. You get disposable plates and plastic utensils, for crying out loud. I get that it's not a fancy Italian restaurant, but spruce up the look a little bit.

 Apps: Shrimp, snails and mussels. Mains: Ribs, Seafood linguine, and pizza. Dessert: Tiramisu, Apple crumble, Brownie. None of it was ""great"", all of it was good.

The store was pretty dead even though there is a LVAC right next door. I expected it to be packed but I was literally the only customer inside at the time. The parking was a mess due to neighboring businesses posting signs in front of their doors claiming those few parking spots. Other than that I has no issues. I'm pretty big on customer satisfaction and I must say the professionalism these guys showed was outstanding. Will definitely return next month when I run out of my vitamins.,1.0
"Just about every food guide for Phoenix pointed me towards Barrio Cafe as a ""must try"", so I decided to check out that award winning restaurant. But after being told there was a minimum one hour wait for a table and seeing $22 enchiladas\/$12 tortas on the menu that included a heavy fusion-spin, I decided that it wasn't for me.

I looked up a similar Mexican cafe nearby that also serves traditional Yucatan and Mexico City style dishes, and ended up outside a building painted in purple-flamingo pink called ""Asi Es La Vida"". From the color of the building to the surreal Frida Kahlo paintings that adorn the walls to the countryside Mexican music, this place had the vibrant and inviting personality that I liked. In addition, the prices were a little more reasonable compared to Barrio Cafe, so I gave it a try.

Based on what I found on the menu, I determined Asi Es La Vida prepares regional Mexican cuisine with a Mexico-City flair. I ordered the recalendato because it combined two of my Mexican favorites, mole and cochinita pibil.

My lunch began with thick corn chips that reminded me of tostada. It was accompanied with two of the best tasting homemade salsas I've ever had. The red salsa was my favorite because of its predominantly smoky profile, while the green salsa appeared to be a more bright, a verdant puree of coriander-mint and green chile. They're more like thick dips rather than the typical salsas at taco stands which I find to be either too chunky or too thin, and overly one-dimensional (simply variations with increasing intensity of heat and no distinct smoky tones available).

I did not do my research so I got ""hustled"" by the waitress - I said yes to guacamole when asked (who would say no, I later realized guac and chips were not a complimentary side). It came with another plate of chips. The guacamole wasn't assembled tableside, but tasted like it was made one by one to order with lots of avocado pulp, so it was actually worth the extra $3.95. The amount of lime flavor added was just right, not too bright. 

The main course was decent but not exceptional. It tasted like a comforting dish prepared at someone's home. The rice was super light and bland, the beans were not refried with melted American cheese (thank goodness not border-style) but instead slow cooked with white cheese sprinkled on top like it is done in Mexico. I thought that the cochinita pibil was prepared better than the mole poblano. For the cochinita, the meat was served in chunks rather than like pulled pork, but the marinade was balanced between acidic and sweet. The only improvement I would suggest is to cook it more ""picante"", it was flat and missing an accent. On the other hand, the mole was a big disappointment since it was overly sweet without a hint of spicy flavor. It didn't have layered, complex, or intense bittersweet tones of the mole poblano that I have eaten before. The mole wasn't something I wanted to lick off my fork.

Overall, Asi Es La Vida was a pleasant change of pace from the Sonoran, Tex-Mex, and Southwestern food that is popular in Phoenix. The service was attentive and the restaurant is family-owned. It's not a loud place like Barrio Cafe plus there is tablecloth, so it could work as a cozy date restaurant. The food was more traditional than contemporary-fusion style. To best honest, I wasn't blown away by the food, but it tasted better than the other Mexican food I ate while staying in Phoenix.",1.0

"Went for dinner tonight at this location. The restaurant only opens at 5:00 p.m., but we arrived at about 4:50 and waited outside till someone let us in closer to opening time.  I fully understand that they only open at 5, but there is a cold weather warning out and several people just looked at us and walked away.

We got ourselves seated and ordered our meals.  After we had ordered another table had come in.  The server at that time informed them of the special, which we over heard, but at no point in time did she let us know about it.  Would have been nice to have another option.  I ordered the Special Fried Rice. The rice wasn't cooked at all.  It wasn't just crunchy from being fried, it had a distinct raw taste.  

Our server never came by to check on us, even thought there was only 1 other  table in the restaurant.  She came by to clear our table and asked me if I was still working on my dish, I advised her the rice wasn't cooked.  She removed the plate and took it to the cook, who very loudly tried to defend that the dish was fine.  So loudly that anyone in the restaurant at that time could hear him.  

The waitress removed the item from our bill and once again you could hear the cook going on and on about how it was cooked.  Even the waitress at the time of payment tried to convince me that it was crunchy because it was fried.

It is really disappointing because I had high hopes to come back and I  understand that mishaps happen in the kitchen, but to have the staff on top of that try to convince me I was wrong was really disappointing.  I will not be returning or recommending to this restaurant and that decision is purely based on service and attitude.",1.0

"Terrible customer service! I've been in a rental car everyday for over 5 years so I know how other companies operate and this is the worst of all of them. I guess that's what you get when you expect good customer service from a foreign company. I rented a vehicle in Phoenix and the moment I drove off the lot, a rock hit the windshield which I understand I'm obligated to pay for. After my insurance paid over $600 to have the windshield replaced Sixt sent me a personal bill for an additional $114 to pay for an ""administration fee."" I contacted Sixt and told them I felt this was ridiculous and I also sent three letters to various customer service departments within the company. They cashed my check and I have yet to hear anything back from anyone in that company. I have requested my company take them off of our travel agency options",1.0

I just thought it was wrong. Been back a few times bringing visitors, always goes over well. FOR ME PERSONALLY fries are not crisp enough and its salty salty salty.

I am sorry to say this is not a a service I will be referring to my friends or family. I recently moved out of my home and sold it so I called and spoke with Cindy from immaculate touch cleaning services and I explained that I needed the move out cleaning. She said it would cost $250 and it would include sanitized and deep clean. When they showed up to clean one was on time and the other was 30 mins late. I had just finished moving out so I was going room to room cleaning all of my stuff and trash out of their way all they had to do was clean and sanitize a house like you would want your house if you were moving in to it. I thought when I discussed my cleaning needs with Cindy on the phone that I was in good hands.(((NOT TRUE)) it was a misleading quote and I was sent unqualified cleaners with improper cleaning materials. They took payment upfront and like a dummy I tipped upfront also they were very slow and unable to finish my walls are dirty as are my doors and my floors are more sticky now than they were before they came. They left before I could inspect and when my husband called the company to ask why they didn't finish Cindy says they ran out of time and the house was more work than they thought. No communication!!!!!!! I will be taking pitchers of everything they skipped and I plan on reporting to the better business bureau very upset I had to spend money only so I would have to go behind them and do it myself anyway,1.0

"High turn over in office and every manager they have had has been a 20 something with an attitude.  I can hear my upstairs neighbors bathing, talking, rand EVERYTHING in between.  They are constantly closing the pool, laundry facility, gym, and clubhouse for photography and remodeling and repairs and because it's a random Thursday in November.   The air conditioning in my apartment was leaking and they entered my home without calling me or notifying me in any way. Came home to holes in my wall, fans running and my sons stuff moved all over the floor.  I thought I had been robbed until I saw the fans.  When I complained about this the next morning the manager told me it was ""an emergency"", but next time they would try to call.  When I told her it is illegal for them to enter my apartment without notice and without my permission she became even more hateful and, basically, told me they had a right anytime they want.  Not true and I should have called the cops. The ""courtesy officer"" they say is available for any issues after hours is a joke.  My neighbors and I all were outside on our patios one night and there was a group of drunks at the pool (there are always drunks at the pool), but this was after it was closed.  The new fence they just added locks, but before that anyone could go in. These people were blasting music and yelling profanity. I volunteered to call and the courtesy officer told me he checked the pool to make sure it was closed.  I told him there were people there. He said to send the office an email and they could check the tapes to see who it was.  Seriously......????  I sent an email.  Never got a response.  My neighbors called the cops because it sounded like it was going to get violent.  In the year I have lived here, at least two neighbors called the cops for problems at the pool after calling the courtesy officer and getting no help.  We have all talked about how we can't wait for the pool to close.  None of us use it because of the problems.  I have seen cars pull up and let four teenagers out and then leave the neighborhood. I don't even think the people causing the problems live here because since school started back there is no one at the pool even on weekends.  I also had the cops show up at my door looking for someone who used to live here. When I voiced my complaints about the noise and problems at the pool to the office staff the ""manager"" told me I was the only one who had ever complained about any problems at the pool.  So, apparently, she is either a liar or in denial.  You can't even walk to and from your car in the summer without a lesson in profanity. One day I even had puke beside my car.  Also, the maintenance guys park their gold carts anywhere they want including behind cars and in the handicapped parking spaces. Twice I have had to go to office and ask them to move their cart so I could get out of my parking space and go to work.  Problem is, office wasn't open yet and I was late to work trying to find them.",1.0

"A one star review is generous considering the amount of errors created by the staff at Excalibur. The first issue was poor customer service. Room Service hours are printed as 6 am - 2 am. I called at 1:40 am and they had already turned the phone line off. I called the front desk asking where 24\/7 food is available, the front desk associate told me Johnny Rockets was open 24\/7. I explained they had a sign out front saying they were closed till 6 am. The associate said she would call the restaurant to find out and contact me back. She never called back which is my complaint. It's disrespectful of my time and money as a guest. 

We had a late checkout for 3 pm and left the ""Privacy Please"" sign on our door. Upon entering the room at 2:20 pm our room had been cleaned and empty! I called the front desk and it took over 30 minutes for security to come. Part of the  missing items were 4 bottles of champagne. An assistant manager Cassandra said that even when alcohol is left behind the cleaning associates do not remove it, they are to call a manager to come collect the alcohol. Ultimately the cleaning associate played dumb to all the items I disclosed as missing but admitted there were bottles of champagne. She said she left them in the hallway but now they're gone. An executive by the name of Claudia Hernandez came up to our room and said the employee admitted to throwing out our possessions (including multiple items of clothing and experiencing an enormous financial lost) but as an executive she could offer us nothing! Not even a true apology that her employees so carelessly fail to follow guidelines that would have prevented our items from being dropped in the trash. How insulting. We were told to wait for Risk Management to contact us and we weren't given any follow up information.

"community bridges, like all medical treatment centers has both competent and incompetent

"I'm on the fence about this. I've been driving for the last month and I make about $11-$12 an hour; which is better than Uber. The passengers can be pleasant, but most aren't. You do pick up junkies from like Rehab and Methadone clinics, which is very concerning as they are very unpredictable. The no show rate is not 1 in 10, it's more like 4 in 10, and you don't get paid for cancellations. Most of the time it's a wrong address and typically a doctor's office is the contact person, so you can't call the passenger directly. When you call the doctor's office they are both unhelpful and very rude. You also don't get paid for your time either.

So my car started having the same issue they allegedly fixed the first time.  I have to go out of town for work so I drop my car off on a TUESDAY with the expectation that it would be done by that FRIDAY.  Let me add that Jason wasn't there and I feel like that made a huge difference for the overall experience.  When I drop it off and go out of town I feel confident that everything is going well because I hadn't heard a peep out of them and they said they would call if there were any issues.  Thursday afternoon I decide to give them a call to see if it would be ready in the morning.  OMG!!!! Not only had they not called but they didn't even know what was wrong with it!!!!  WHY DIDN'T THEY CALLLLL ME!!!????  Of course they couldn't find the issue because it's a Mercedes and sooooo complicated blah....blah....blah.  I was INCENSED!!!!  After fuming all night I got on a plane and called in Uber on the way over to tell him he needed to fix my car THAT day and I wasn't leaving it there another week.  So I plop myself down on their couch and basically MAKE them fix it.  He kept telling me it had NOTHING to do with the previous work they did but it was part of the same system so how could it NOT!!?!?!?!?  I'm far from stupid but I just wanted my car fixed and to get out of there.

The service great. Super swift, very courteous, and understanding of my sheltering from the rain bit. It was really cold inside, though, and I was never able to take my coat off.

The food was just meh. Really, nothing to come back for (unless you are a local and get to know the owners, who are very sweet). Seriously, though, not as great as people are trying to make it out to be. The broth was bland and I had to ask for cilantro, lime, etc. They had a flan-like dessert that my server raved about. It tasted like...flan. Good flan, but just flan. The menu was typical of a Pho place, except for that flan.",1.0
Every time I drive by this location the line is at least 20 cars long for the drive-thru. I've been here twice so far but have been inside compared to going through the drive-thru.

Love this place! I first started going about 6 mo ago when my sister gifted me a service for my birthday. I initially went to Felicia and she was great. I then went to another girl for a full bikini (forgot her name but it doesn't matter now). Worst mistake ever! She was horrible and had to get someone else to help her finish. I was in the back forever. I'll spare you the gory details but the manager totally made up for it. Anna completed the bikini (she was great!). She apologized and said she didn't want to lose me as a client. Turns out the girl was new and just couldn't keep up with the high standards of EWC (she's gone now).

"Hi Yelpers,

I just had my first visit to Silverado Family Dental, and WOW!!!! am I blown away with an exceptional customer\/patient experience. Upon arriving to the office for my visit, the moment I entered the beautiful practice I was greeted by name and quickly given the paper work for first time registration. My insurance had already been pre-verified prior to my appointment. This practice is really performing modern dentistry.

The decor is very inviting and have a soothing lavender painted walls sensation to create a calm inviting experience. The music in the waiting area is very vibrant and diverse to reach many different groups of people. 

Dental Care: I encountered the best Hygienist ever named Suzy Hogan RDH. she took great care of me. Performed x-rays, probed about my previous dental history, and made solid recommendations. The Dr. Is very polished and helpful as well.

Personal: Suzy didn't just treat me as a patient she also engaged me in my personal life, realized her son loves watches just like me...we spoke about my career, and all the places i've lived. She even helped me discover my new favorite toothbrush the Oral-B 5000 that I purchased right at the office for $85.00 with a cool $20.00 mail in rebate. She provided me with detailed instruction on each bristle and how to operate my new dental apparatus.

If I could rate this office 10 stars I would. Thanks for being a trusted dental advocate serving the Las Vegas community.",1.0
"This is probably my favourite Jewish bakery in Montreal. They are known for their Russian babkas, and with reason. The babkas are so decadent, overflowing with chocolate. I would also recommend the cheese crowns, essentially mink cheese cake pies of joy, and the cheese marble swirl cake. Another great thing about this place is they are open late (until 11:00pm most nights, with the exception of Saturday's), which means whenever the babka craving hits, you can easily hop on over.",1.0
"I visited this restaurant on  the advice of a co-worker. I went during lunch and found the food to be fabulous! I had the chicken tenders, mac & cheese and candied yams. No complaints about the food. I loved it and I have been to Ibby's 3 times this month.  

My only complaints are that each time I have visited, I ordered the chicken tenders and each time after waiting 15 minutes or more for my meal (no complaint about the time.. just stating a fact) I received chicken wings. It is really weird to me that they consistently give me wings when I am very explicit with my order and state that I want chicken tenders. This is just weird that this mistake happens every time. Today, I placed a to-go order for chicken tenders and when I got to my destination....I HAD CHICKEN WINGS!!! I should have checked before leaving the restaurant but this time I repeated several times when placing my order that I wanted chicken tenders.  Not sure how much clearer I could have been.

Secondly, I dont understand why they never make enough desert, specifically the peach cobbler.  Each time I have visited, they have been out of the cobbler. I was told that it sells out early.  That is fine, but if a restaurant sells something that is a popular item, why not make enough to last the entire day.  If you are selling out by lunch time and you are open for dinner, then that is just very poor planning on the part of the restaurant.  If this consistently happens, then remove peach cobbler from the dinner menu.

Overall, I will return because the food really is good. I will however, NOT leave without  checking my order.  Also, I wont make plans to have desert because most likely there wont be any available anyway.",1.0

The wrong sandwich was delivered and when we called them on it they brought us the same sandwich with additional ingredients, but still not the sandwich we ordered. 22...

Dean Micalizio made a verbal agreement and then sued me saying I owed him about $14K when I had paid him the $100 a month we agreed to.  I was not even the only one he sued that day, see how many people this business has sued.  
Board of Chiropractic Medicine was made aware of his practices and you should be too!  No bill sent until months after stopped going there.  No mention of anything other than the $100 a month agreed upon until left.
Wow, do you really want to deal with someone who can tell such falsehoods?  I was glad to have the judge say pay $500 NOT the $14K (was sent 3 bills, all months after stopping going there and they all had a different value).  Went to court rather than pay someone who could not say what he meant ""You will only ever have to pay $100 a month.  That is all you have to worry about.""  That was our verbal agreement, and it was never disputed that it was this.  It was paid in full each month. 
Judge was appalled at the billing practices as was the Board of Chiropractic Medicine.  Since I had no recording or paper work of what was verbally agreed upon I was ruled against, which was fine, he cannot come after me for more as I will never use any service from this ""person"" again.
  This is what I am saying, don't do business with someone who won't put in writing what is agreed upon.  This ""person"" won't.  Draw your own conclusions, I don't need his verbal abuse, just don't want anyone else to have to have this happen to them.  So totally a rip-off in my opinion!

"I'd just arrived in Inverness and after checking in went venturing about for something to enjoy.    I came across this cute restaurant not far from our hotel.  Thought it was worth a looksie.   When I entered with my husband we were asked if we had a reservation.  As it appeared to be somewhat vacant (one table in the rear full and one couple near the front) I didn't realize we needed one.  A bit begrudgingly, the hostess sat us at a double table without much indication of which half of this seating we were to sit on.  After a bit of further guidance, we got our menus, our ""proper"" seating, and our drinks.  I had a local cider, Thistle Cider, and my hubs enjoyed a local IPA.  It took sometime to get our order taken as it appeared only one person was taking orders despite the two other gals walking about.  

Our food was delicious, which raised the level of stars for this review.  I had a chicken pasta with a Parmesan cheese sauce.  My husband had their rump steak.  Both were prepared perfectly.  I loved that they used a dumb waiter to deliver the food from the kitchen.  During the middle of our meal, a rather large group of locals entered and took up the seats by the door.  They had the door closed for them, which I must say was the beginning of the end of our joyful time here.  By the look of them, we knew they had some power as regulars here.  In the next few minutes the temperature began to mount,  By the time we finished our meal we were sweating and fanning ourselves with brochures from our pockets.  We asked for dessert to go, but were told they do nothing ""take away"".  I do also want to note that their dessert is on just one chalk board and must be moved around to each table based on need.

Upon arrival the place was basically empty. I was asked if I wanted to eat in or take out. I chose to eat in. Since I like fish tacos I asked about them and was told they were very good. The fish they use is mahi mahi. I didn't have to wait long for my meal to be served. The tacos come in two soft shells, the fish lay on a bed of rice with guacamole sauce on it. They give you a side of sauce. My error in that I didn't test it out first to learn it was a hot sauce. The meal also comes with a side of black beans. I did like the fact the tacos were soft. It can get a bit messy but everything was cooked to order.

I found the fish tacos to be just okay since I'm not used to eating them mixed with rice. You get two to a plate which is enough for me.

"The Heart Bar, located inside Planet Hollywood, is known for its dancers. Not its overpriced drinks. Not for the decor of Naugahyde couches and a poster of a bald headed germaphobe named Pitbull.  And certainly not for the stout little people in fishnets serving drinks.  

So why would the management of the HB decide to only feature the dancers on certain nights?  Even during the most significant 2007-2011 collapse of the economy since the Great Depression, management had the business sense to leave the dancers in place.  The night I went to the HB I was told by the Lil' waitress that the dancers were not dancing and had no idea of when they would return.  This is like capping Old Faithful in Yellowstone or draping a bed sheet over Picasso's Guernica at the Museo Reina Sofia.  Bad decision, short-sighted (;-), with what appears to be an intentional effort to ignore the customer's needs.  

As a result, the bar was empty.  So management, here is a brief primer on a statistical term called a correlation coefficient:

Positive correlation coefficient - Hot dancers, music pumping, bar full of patrons, many drinks sold, HB makes lots of money, customers feel that their $15 drink was worth the money and they were not short-changed (OK, I'll stop it.   But really, is there an OSHA safety statute in Nevada that requires the HB Human Resources department to only hire waitresses under 5 feet tall with an oversized ballast so they can round corners at high speeds without tipping over?  Just curious).

After sitting outside for five minutes I went back inside and took a menu off of one of the tables.

"Great boat rental service. Hands down the best we've ever experienced.   This lake and the desert scenery were beautiful.   

Boat was the newest, best maintained and outfitted that we've ever rented.  Most rental boats tend to be functional but with minimal instrumentation and amenities, and weather worn.  This looked like a private owner's boat:  great condition, shade cover, etc.   Handled well.  Cost was $80\/hour with two hour minimum (plus gas, and plus $400 reserve deposit against boat damage -- all of which is standard for boat rentals).  

One thing to note:  the staff here are professionals and serious about people's safety.  I'm pointing this out in response to some of the other commenters complaining that the service staff weren't ""nice enough"" or refused to rent to them for X reason, yada yada.  

News flash from somebody who boats:  there's an amazing amount of boating-related stupidity out there, even in normal places (unsafe driving, drinking while driving, ignoring traffic rules, swimming around live motors etc.).  Given that this is Las Vegas with tons of tourists from around the world, the ignorance and dumbassery risks are huge.  

This isn't some casino or strip club where you call the shots and the staff are supposed to kiss your ass.  People get injured and killed around boats *all the time*.  The staff here know this, and they have to deal with the consequences if one of their renters effs up.   

Therefore, the rental personnel are no-nonsense.  I found them to be perfectly nice, just serious.  They know Nevada boating rules, the lake and the weather patterns.  Frankly, their rental rules are less stringent than many other places -- for example, you can beach their boats, which most rental places (including on other famous lakes like Tahoe) won't let you do, because of the risk of a newbie boater damaging the hull or propeller.  

So yes, you do have watch a safety video (and really watch it, not ignore it while you play on your phone).  Yes, you do have to wear a life vest.  Yes, you need to stay in the part of the lake where they tell you to (it's a huge lake -- easy to miscalculate distance).  No, you can't rent a boat too late in the day even for ""a little while.""

I came here with a group of friends for pedicures based on a recommendation. We went with the KING. It was good, nothing special. I asked for french tips and they turned out a bit uneven.

They charge you a fee for leaving a tip on a credit card, I believe the fee was $2. That seems ridiculous to me and was really inconvenient for one of my friends who didn't have cash and wasn't made aware of this until the end. I am a server and people leave credit card tips ALL THE TIME, I don't see what the big deal is and what could possible warrant a $2 per customer fee.

What did I like best?   If you like zucchini noodles (i love zucchini noodles), they go great with the roasted sesame dressing.   Otherwise, their sushi rice is cooked properly.   I never understood why anyone would want to eat raw kale....but there's a bunch of people that enjoy it, and that is an option.    There's also a smoked tofu vegetarian option that I didn't get to try, but that looks super tasty!  

Their tuna and salmon pieces are cut up pretty small, but very uniform and spoon fork friendly (so you get a bit of everything for texture and flavour)...and they are heavy handed with their Tobiko....I love tobiko.  :-)  

My favourite part?  Crushed wasabi peas and fried scallions as the crunchy bits in my meal.  :-)  I was pleasantly surprised with this.   I am going to make sure I add that into my salads from now on....it's okay if I steal some of the yummy ideas right?

"A visit inspired by Anthony Bourdain's Part's Unknown in Korea.  I watched in awe and curiosity as he ate Budae Jjigae.  A  Kimchi stew consisting of noodles, Spam, hotdogs, and beans.  I knew I had to find a place in town to try this!

I spoke with a Korean buddy at work and he knew immediately of the stew I was talking about.  He sent me to Soyo.  

I went home that night and grabbed the GF and off went.  This part of the valley sure has a lot to offer in the way of eats.

"EXPENSIVE......This place used to be a regular visit when ever I came through Phoenix. I was shocked to see the high prices on my most recent and what will be my last visit. To put things into perspective, they are charging $35 for a Sashimi dinner. Matsuisa in LA , one of the highest rated sushi restaurants in the country, charges $36 and can justify that price. The sashimi I did try was cold and had not been properly thawed. If you are going to up the prices at least understand that sushi needs to be served at room temperature. Overall a frustrating experience. $9.50 for a basic spicy tuna roll.....I could go on and on about the new inflated prices. 

Not sure if they are under new management , but they are certainly going in the wrong direction. The section devoted to sandwiches was also surprising and indicative of some confusion in the kitchen. I have never seen teriyaki fish sandwiches and don't understand why they would need an entire section of the menu. My friend ordered a roll that came to the table covered in Chinese crispy wonton noodles....not impressed or tasty. 

During our meal we heard what I suppose was one of the owners discussing new ideas for the decor....I was tempted to ask what happened. My advice would be to leave a good thing alone....the prices are outrageous and unjustified. I am sure there are better places in the area and I will certainly be looking for them on my next visit.

"This is my third time coming to this place. and i have to say that unfortunately. it has gone downhill since. I used to actually like this location because of the vibe the staff, and some of the food was pretty tasty. in the past it was worth a 4 star. now the 2 star is because a lot of it has fallen quickly.  

when we first arrived at the restaurant our friend had gotten a seat, and we saw that there were plenty of empty seats around the side booth and since we have yet to order or use anything we asked the hostess if we could switch to the other seats. This is when the hostess rolled her eyes and gave us the biggest attitude, told us ""these tables are all requested"" i asked are they reserved? she said no they are requested. i said okay well i'm requesting one now too. she slammed the menus on the new tables rolled her eyes again and just stormed off. 

i have no idea how this type of attitude is acceptable, especially at an izakaya where friendly and open bar atmosphere is why people come. 

We had gotten to the table and the waitress herself was friendly, and this is the only reason this hasn't dropped to a 1 star. becuase the food certainly decreased in quality. 

we ordered the japa burgers, mentai crispy potato, double salmon roll, and the crispy tuna on chip. 

The first thing was mentai cripsy potato used to be the best thing on their menu. that has fallen downhill a lot. as the sauce and the spices aren't what they used to be and is bland at best. 

the double salmon roll, just wasn't a good combination for a roll, especially given that they used smoked salmon in a restaurant that actually serves sashimi. 

the cripsy tuna on chip, was pretty flavourless as well. all the previous dressings are gone, and literally it is tuna a a tortilla chip. 

the final thing the Japa burgers was only thing that seemed to still be okay, as the taste hasn't changed much. 

in the middle of our dinner after ordering and us telling the waitress we wanted to keep one menu to keep ordering, the hostess would again drop by to lecture us about keeping menus we aren't going to immediately order again. 

basically i'm only giving them 2 stars at this point was becuase the bar looks clean, and the actual waitress was okay. however the food itself has gone downhill, and the angry hostess has really eliminated all reasons to go.

i used to do major group events at this place. now not only am i not going here anymore, i'm going to recommend all people i know to avoid this place like the plague. as its not a good price deal. crappy service, and food is bland. there is little saving grace for it.",1.0

"I feel terrible that I talked my sister into signing my nephew up for this facility's kids summer program. Today she receives a call from the owner threatening to take her to court if she didn't pay her monthly fee of $79\/a month. Mind you, on May 21st I took my sister and my nephew to LVAC so she could sign up my nephew for this summer program because I attended the gym there on the weekends which are the days I have my nephew. My sister and her family live across town. When my sister was signing up, the owner, Apollo was trying to sell her this package for $499 which at the time she explained that she could t afford because she had just started a new job. Apollo continued on negotiating with her and finally settled with a monthly plan of $79\/ a month for the 6 week program of which she was to pay $79 down at that time. My sister went on and did so. My sisters schedule ended up changing at work so my nephew couldn't attend all the summer classes. No, cancellation letter was mailed, no one called, and no one emailed her to inform her that my nephew had been dropped. However, my sister kept her word and continued to make her payment for June, and July. Now the owner, Apollo will not give us a copy of the ""2yr contract"" that she supposedly signed and harassing and antagonizing us through text. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN HERE!

"I found lucky me pet care on Yelp and after reading there wonderful reviews I'd thought I'd give them a shot. I met with the owner two days before services were to start and she's seemed very kind and knowledgeable. My reason for giving only two stars is because I specifically requested for a text or a call when someone arrives to the house to care for my dogs. Our flight was at 5am Friday morning and pet care services were suppose to start Friday afternoon. We received no call, text or email verifying our pups were taken care of. I emailed, left a voicemail, and texted the owner who I met with a couple days before and she did not return any of my messages until it was time to pay and that was only regarding my second email about the payment break down. Instead, another guy texted me (whom I've never spoken too) Saturday morning stating my dogs have been taking care of and that they usually only send pictures once a day. Well If that's true, why wasn't I notified on Friday that someone had stopped by, I had to wait the next morning around 11 to make sure they were okay. Worst part of my trip was worrying if my dogs were okay. I don't think it's fair to pay for a day where I'm not sure if they were even here or not Friday night. There's really no way of knowing forsure because they send you pictures as a verification but many pictures can be taken at once and send to you periodically throughout there stay. The last thing I would point out is during the one on one meeting before services begin, your meeting with the manager, NOT the person who will be staying in your home (which I was also uncomfortable with because I wanted to know who would be occupying my home while I'm away). I don't think I'll be recommending this company or using them again.",1.0

"Beertopia is the unofficial kick-off event for beer week and is amongst several events being held throughout the week.  This was my first official Beerfest and I cannot tell you how excited I was to attend. We even purchased our tickets in January to ensure we were not sidelined.  

We got to Baxter Village early and got pretty good parking.  Our first stop was Six Pence  where we headed for a bite to eat. After filling our tummies with some Irish fare we strolled over to Grapevine around 1pm. There was a line already snaking the building but after the VIPs entered, we were among the first dozen in line.

Two o'clock came. Armed with my husband as the photo\/camera man and my red notebook, we eagerly entered. I was like a kid in a candy shop. It was pleasantly overwhelming. 

We hit the rear of the event first thinking most partakers would try brew vendors at the front first. Considering that 1,300 tickets were sold,  it didnt seem all that crowded. In fact, the long lines that some spoke of from previous years were really maybe five deep: MAX. 

I hit over two dozen breweries, talked beer and even took a slight break in just under 2 hours. People are friendly to the extent of wanting to be in our pics and those manning the taps were knowledgeable and willing to engage in beer convo!

With my redbook, pencil, and eagerness to know MORE.... there was a moment at Bell's Brewery while I was asking pertinent questions that my husband backed up to take a pic.

I do a lot of powerlifting, and I strain my back sometimes from my form slipping. I've done acupuncture in the past and it's always helped alleviate the pain quicker than other options. 
Dr. Ferris was very professional and kind. Other places I've been to don't really dig into what's going on. They kind of just have you lay down, and quickly start after you tell them where the pain is.

"I have been holding off writing this review for months.  Ever since my first appointment there have been issues ranging from Misdiagnosis to Almost KILLING ME.

My first appointment was to figure out why after eating anything with dairy I would have anaphylaxis.  They performed a Skin Prick test which came back negative.  They diagnosed me with Idiopathic Anaphylaxis.  I disagreed with their test (which Skin Prick Tests are NOT fool proof) and started making a Food Diary and listing all of the foods which cause a reaction, how long it took for the reaction to initiate and what were the symptoms of said reaction.  After a month or two, I was able to show proof that Dairy is the cause of my reactions.  They officially diagnosed me with a Dairy Allergy.

I also have Asthma, I was diagnosed in January 2016 by my Primary Care doctor, however he never prescribed any medication to maintain it.  All I got was Ventolin which only reverses a active attack, it does nothing to prevent it.  I was prescribed Symbicort by a Urgent Care center and my Insurance refused to pay for it.  After being put on Dulera, my symptoms were greatly reduced, however I still was having more Asthma Attacks than what would be considered under control.

I had an appointment to perform a Pulmonary Function Test (which they force every patient to do at EVERY Appointment) and to go over my current medications.  They found that my PFT came back with my Lung Function at ~70%, they claimed that my medications weren't working well enough.  I was switched from Dulera to QVAR.  After taking it only once, I refused to take it again since it burned my throat due to having Ethanol in it.  I went back the next day and was told that they would be putting me on Breo.  I filled the prescription and was told ""This medication has Dairy in it and should NEVER be used if you have a Dairy Allergy""  I called Tottori's office and was advised that ""There isn't enough Dairy in it to trigger a reaction"".  Against my better judgement, I followed their advice and used Breo for the first time.  20 minutes later I was having a SERIOUS Allergic Reaction.

After going to Urgent Care I was found to be having a Symptomatic Allergic Reaction to Breo.  I was given a ""Dexamethasone Sodium Phosphate 10MG\/ML Injection"" to my ass.  The reaction quickly diminished and I was given HydrOXYzine HCI to manage any lingering reaction.  I was told to NEVER take that Breo again.

I called Tottori's office and alerted them to my reaction.  I was told to come in for a appointment to review my medications to find a solution.  I brought in all of my left over medications to dispose including 4 never used Dulera Samples.  They prescribed me Spiriva Respimat as a last ditch effort.

Over the next few days my symptoms were getting worse.  I felt like I wasn't on any controller medication and was having very severe attacks.  I looked up Spiriva online and found that even the manufacture states that Spiriva is an ADD-ON medication and should NEVER be used as a replacement for a Controller Medication.  So I took one of my last remaining Dulera's and started using it in conjunction with Spiriva.  After a day or two my Asthma Symptoms were starting to diminish.  I was able to go over a week without using my Ventolin.

I alerted Tottori's office and requested that they submit a new prescription of Dulera.  Little did I know, they would manage to screw this request up as well.

I was taking 200\/5 Dulera, they submitted 100\/5 Dulera.  I now have to call and get this fixed.

My only question for Tottori is ""WHERE IS THE ACCOUNTABILITY?""  All they have managed to do is waste $1,000s and put my life in danger.  I have never encountered a medical office so incapable of peer reviewing and preventing mistakes that put their patients lives at risk.",1.0

"I don't know if the other reviewers experienced a different staff or cook but I was disappointed. My friend suggested it based on good reviews on Yelp so we met for 1130A brunch on Sunday. The restaurant was half full, and we were steered to THE VERY LAST TABLE IN THE BACK. The Antipodes.  We were dressed like humans, had no strange growths or odors emanating, and I asked my friend who is a lot more accommodating than I, apparently, if this was OK and she didn't want to fuss. They had room to accommodate us at a 4 top and squished us into the last 2 top against a wall. No grand rush came in the time we were there so I can't explain the seating.   The server was genial and made personal recommendations when asked,  I don't fault him. My friend said the coffee was good and she had a salad. I had a chile pork sandwich which had zero nuance of chile. I give them applause for the fries, they were crunchy and delicate and very good. For the price and lack of flavor, I will not return.",1.0
"This was our first time using Showtime for our transfer to\/from the airport. We pre purchased our tickets online and had our tickets printed. When we arrived at the airport, the Showtime pick up location was easy to find outside the doors. Our shuttle arrived in minutes. 

The transfer to our hotel did take some time. We got on this small sized bus. Our driver loaded lots of other travelers and I would say the process of loading and checking other passengers took about fifteen minutes. Once passengers were loaded, our driver took us to our destination. 

We chose the MGM on this trip and luckily, we were the first stop. When going from hotel to airport, we were among maybe a few people going to the airport. We went directly from our hotel there! This may or may not happen to you, you may want to check with them to make sure you have enough to time to get to the airport.

"3 parties in the place and it took a looooong time to get our sandwiches (we were the 2nd of 3 people to order).  Great guy taking orders, making sandwiches but that's the problem, there was only one person working there.  Sandwiches were average, certainly not gourmet.

"This place has 5 stars for a reason. Skip the dealerships, skip the sketchy mechanic shops, and bring your car here. Rock bottom prices, top notch quality, and mechanics you can trust. My boy Youssef (spelling?) hooked me up with a PCV Valve in under 24 hours when most places couldn't get it to me for a few days. Oh and by the way, it was 40 dollars less than the dealerships quote price on the valve, and I went with the OEM option (top recommended). 
They also offered to throw it in for 1 hour of labor (round $75) compared to VW who wanted $240 for the 15 minutes of labor required to replace the part. Definitely glad i found this place!!!

"Meh, I've never had an exceptional experience here.  Some pros are it's location and it's proximity to me and the variety of the menu. I like their offerings and when you look at the menu, it looks fantastic. However, some cons are the incredibly slow service and the food is just not that great. 

I've been here on many occasions and it's never really my first pick. But then you look at the menu, and you think for a second it might turn out just fine. It always goes downhill after you're seated. Incredibly long wait times for the wait staff to get your drinks, your orders, and then your food. Plan to be here a few hours. 

My last visit was during brunch. Boy does the brunch menu look fantastic, but execution just was not there. I ordered the chicken and waffle. If you like your chicken extra extra extra crispy, you might enjoy their chicken. If you like a dense waffle, you might like their waffles. For me, everything was just a bit too tough to chew on. I will say the flavors were ok, but the texture ruined it for me. 

Overall, I'm not a fan. I return for its central location and somehow, the online menu always lures me in to only make a fool out of me later.",1.0
"Had a strong hankering for prime rib. Was staying at the Aliante Hotel Casino Resort and thought why not try their signature steakhouse.  Upon walking in you are surrounded by a spectacular oval bar with shimmering glass, a huge wine bottle display, high vaulted ceilings, staff dressed to the nines. Seating area is dark browns with lots of tans and ivory, steakhouse vibe for sure.  My meal started off with warm pretzel sticks and whipped butter, nice opening round.  I kept it simple, ordered the perfectly seasoned prime rib dressed with au jus gravy and horseradish.  The steak was juicy, succulent and melted in my mouth.  The wheels came off the bus somewhat during my sides of macaroni and cheese and creamed spinach.  While their tastes were steakhouse quality and yummy, they were served to me almost cold, I sent them back for a reheat.  They were better when returned, but the head chef can't let that happen for this quality of restaurant.  And speaking of that, why have we in America gotten too casual.  This is a fine dining establishment, with 5 star service, and yet the majority of diners were in casual shorts, hoodies, and sweat pants, it's a disgrace.  Europeans would be appalled. Now that my rant is over I finished my meal with a proper creme brûlée that was creamy, sweet and dressed with fresh fruit, a very appropriate ending to an excellent meal. Some final thoughts to the MKRT team, heat your serving plates and tell me be careful, your plate is very hot.  Offer me some melted butter to dip my steak in, and serve that au jus gravy boiling hot, not lukewarm.  If there are temperature issues, served the food covered before presentation.  The steak should also extremely hot when first served, think Ruth Chris hot.  So with all that said, I loved the vibe of this place, it's very close to going to a higher level.",1.0
"Do not EVER use their personal training service. The trainers are not qualified to oversee your physical fitness.

"Our group of seven tried Nani Restaurant last night. The restaurant has two large rooms with booths and round tables. The tables have lazy susans which allow you to easily share dishes. There are also multiple tanks which allow you to see the seafood you may be eating later.

The menu has two sides. One side has appetizers and entrees divided up by vegetable, pork, beef & lamb, seafood, chicken and duck. The other side has 63 dim sum type dishes priced based on size (S, M, L, Special). Although they don't roll carts past and have you choose plates as in a traditional dim sum restaurant, you can order what you like and they will bring them out as each dish is prepared.

We had a nice waitress who explained how to order, took our drinks, and answered many of our questions. Dishes were brought out by whomever was available when each platter was ready to be served. Everyone was friendly.

We started with the Deep-Fried Crab Meat & Seaweed Roll. It's a crab-stick (imitation crab) wrapped in a slice of seaweed and then deep-fat fried. The seaweed flavor is very strong. I'm not a crab-stick fan and this did not change my mind.

This was followed by Chaozhou Style Dumpling. The contents of this are mainly diced carrot and chest-nut and some sort of meat. It's quite crumbly. They are steamed and the wrapper was much larger than the contents inside. A dipping sauce would have helped this dish tremendously.

My favorite dish of the night was the Baby Cuttlefish with Curry Sauce. The cuttlefish were bite-sized and tender. The curry sauce was just a tad spicy with tons of flavor. I will order this dish every time I go back.

We also had the homemade Fish Balls. These were incredibly dense, chewy, and not particularly flavorful. They were much better once I starting dipping them in the curry sauce left over from the cuttlefish. This dish should really be served with a sauce.

The Pan-Fried Vegetable and Pork Bun was another success. The bun is sweet with just a slight crunch from the fry. There is a light coating of oil giving it a beautiful shine. The insides were savory and light. I would order this again.

We also enjoyed the Pan-Fried Green Chive Cake. These chewy\/doughy dumplings were loaded with chives. Excellent flavor. I would order this again.

Our last dim-sum plate was a Baked Creamy Egg Yolk Bun. This tasted just like Bisquick Coffee Cake. It looked like a cross between a steamed bun and a muffin and had a brown sugar filling. It was fine, but not something I traditionally associate with Chinese food.

From the appetizer menu we tried the Jelly Fish with Szechuan Sauce. I love to try new things. The sauce was spicy and delicious. The jelly fish were cold. They have a texture like tendon. It's dense, chewy, rubbery, and almost crunchy. I'm glad I tried it, but I would not get it again.

Also from the appetizer menu was something called Chiu Chow Style Marinated Platter. This consisted of tofu, duck feet and tripe w\/some beef or pork pieces which were marinated and served cold. The meat pieces were OK. I'm glad I had a chance to try duck feet, but they are just chewy skin covering bone. No flavor; not an appealing texture; I would not order this again.

Our of nine dishes I tried, I would only recommend three. However, there were dozens of other dishes to try and I was not necessarily ordering dishes I expected to like, rather trying new things. I will definitely go back and try more.",1.0

"Alright, so I picked Sixt because I could get a Benz, Audi, BMW, Caddy or Volvo for cheaper than a full size car like an Impala from the other companies.  I was a bit nervous based on other reviews and it felt too good to be true.  Rolling around Phoenix in a Benz with my family?  How awesome!!  So when we got there, I was told all they had left were brand new Volvo XC60's.  Great, I saw that coming...  Fine, I'll take it.  I had enrolled in their Sixt Advantage Circle, so I was offered an Audi A6.  Perfect, I'll take it!  Gave them my DEBIT card and was informed they DO NOT ACCEPT debit cards.  That's important.  Most of my cards all say ""debit,"" but also work as credit.  The reason is for the premium cars like an Audi, Mercedes or BMW, the credit card hold is $1,000 or MORE!!!  No wonder they don't take debit cards.  So back to the XC60.  Had to use my wife's CC for a $499 hold on the Volvo.  Fine, but because of that, they insisted that she had to be the primary driver and me the secondary.  That's an extra $11 a day.  We needed a car seat, which was like $11 a day, so she offered me a credit for the car seat in order to ""wash out"" the secondary driver fee.  Fine.  Their receipts are somewhat cumbersome, so I'm not really sure if I got the credit or not...  Whatever.  All in, our bill ended up being $443.  It ended up being more than if I would have gone with Dollar or whatever, but I suppose the premium rental was worth it.  The car was great.  Had 8 miles on it when we pulled out of the garage.  Return was a bit tough to find because Sixt's signs are small and because they are a new player, not well marked yet.  All in all, it was fine, just know that when you rent a premium class, they REQUIRE an actual credit card for an astronomical hold fee.  Oh and they will really try to up sell the extra insurance by claiming your insurance doesn't cover you in Arizona.  Not sure how true that is.  Make sure you have your ducks in a row.  Oh and don't crash the car.  They'll get you for $50 a day for every day the car is in the shop, especially if you don't take their extra insurance.",1.0
"never saw the MD, so I can't comment on the clinical side of the office.  The administrative side really needs a review centered on patient care.  
My husband had a 7:30 AM appt and was told there is a 40 minute delay...not great since he can't eat or drink 12 hours prior to procedure, but we understand.  
After 60 minutes in the waiting room, I ask the front desk clerk for a status update and am told that there is another 40 minute delay...now we are at nearly 2 hour wait time. After two hours ""running behind schedule"", my husband asks for an update and is told it will be another 2 hours...now a 4 hour delay.  The staff was surprised that we weren't willing to wait and was insolent when we asked for another appointment within a reasonable time frame. My husband had booked 4 weeks prior for this appointment.
Apparently there was an equipment malfunction; understand, that happens.  What should not happen is (1) withholding information from your patients, (2) making them wait an unreasonable length of time, or (3) expecting that your patients would be interested in waiting for 4 hours in a medical waiting room--(1) poor patient care, (2) disrespectful of patients time, and (3) thoughtless about patient medical conditions - my husband is diabetic and being without food or water for 4 hours is a medical emergency.
This experience makes me question their professionalism...if you can't manage patient appointments, can you manage a healthcare emergency?
btw: the waiting room was crowded beyond capacity, patients were waiting in the hallway which was not air conditioned (it was 105 outside)

It was just plain naan and I wasn't expecting much but man I was wrong. It was the perfect piece; slightly sweet, chewy, salty, and so perfect. I would order fifty of these when I come back. It is a hole in the wall place that isn't well lit and it's also in a sketchy part of town, but other than that lunch buffet is a must try. And eat the naan.",1.0
"This is the second location for Showboy. I never made the trek to their Henderson spot, so I'm glad they opened up this one off of Haulapai, just south of Summerlin. The glitzy, elegant interior lives up to the Showboy name as it looks like the lobby of a theater.

Most of the cupcakes I've had have been excellent. Chocoholics will love ""The Director"" for its rich, sweet chocolate overdose of both cake and buttercream or ""The Emcee"" with its thick, sugary German chocolate topping. If you want something lighter, ""Lemon Minnelli"" is a must. The tartness and subtle sweetness  of the vanilla cake and lemon cream cheese was a nice contrast to the heavier chocolate cupcake. ""Strawberry Champagne"" was another great, fruity option and the ""Wonderland"" was a good take on a carrot cake cupcake with enough spice in the cake to balance the sweet orange blossom cream cheese topping.

My least favorite has been ""Cookies N Green."" I'm typically a fan of mint chocolate, but the mint in the buttercream was too much.

Despite that, the beautifully decorated and creative desserts Showboy produces makes this one of my top cupcake destinations.

"This is my favorite place for Thai food in Cleveland. It's an authentic Thai restaurant tucked away in a cozy side street, away from the hustle and bustle of Ohio City's main street of restaurants and breweries. I have tried almost everything on their menu, and I highly recommend the Pad Thai dish if you fancy the classic noodles, the Pad See Ew dish if you crave thicker and wider noodles with a more soy saucy taste, and also the Curry dishes if you want to add some spice into your life. Service is friendly and accommodating. If you haven't been here before, they tend to recommend you start off your spicy level at 1 out of 5. I think 3\/5 is the maximum I'm able to handle. As a tip, ask for extra spice on the side. They take reservations over the phone, which is helpful for busy dinner times if you have a large party and don't want to wait. They also do carry out and close at relatively late hours which is awesome! Free street parking is located along the side road of the restaurant, which is convenient. Overall, Banana Blossom is a great place for a dinner date, a family meal outing, or a satisfying foodie experience with a group of friends in an intimate setting. Highly recommend!",1.0
"I came in here with my cousin, and as soon as we entered we felt like the owner was eyeing us very unwelcoming. We brushed it aside and walked around looking at the items they had on display. There was a Caucasian couple in the store as well looking around. As we walked my cousin and I chatted and then came into a smaller room at the back of the store that had plastic M&M Figurines we once had growing up. As my cousin and I chatted about the figurines the owner comes up from behind us and say: ""hey!.. I'm watching you two!"" sternly like we were children trying to steal. 

We both looked at him in disbelief and said ""I'm sorry, what was that?""  to which he relied: ""I said I am WATCHING you!""... We looked at him confused... He then said ""You don't want to buy; get out!"". This was the rudest thing that happened on my trip visiting my family in Montreal. He clearly wanted us out, so we started walking towards the door. As we were leaving I asked him ""what was it that we did? And why didn't you talk to the other 2 customers in the store like that?"" He then said: "" Because you touch! Don't Touch just look!! Don't Touch!!!"". He was referring to when my cousin had seen a small plastic football helmet and picked it up. It was the ones you used to buy in the machines where you put in a quarter and turn the knob. (retail price $2.50). The caucasian who were also in the store looked at this whole situation in disbelief as they too were looking at things and picking them up to examine them. They were treated completely different from how we were. 

Discrimination and racial prejudice is something I have felt and dealt with before, and I stand up against it, so I asked him. What was his name: he refused to give it to me and then asked if I was the police. He then said: ""You want to go outside?!"" and then pushed his way towards me. ""No"" I replied, ""I just want to know why you're treating us differently from the other people in the store."" he then said again: ""why? Are you the police?!"" 

I had enough of this shit. I asked for his business card which he refused to give and then he threatened us again wanting to ""go take us outside!"". He clearly wanted to fight us which was really stupid, so we walked out..

Salad and a dessert (usually halwa) is provided. The site claims to provide home made food and it indeed is. The food is prepared by a Gujrati lady and there is no overdose of colors, masala and preservatives. Sometimes, simplicity just wins!  A Thali costs about $7.99 (pre taxes) and sounds reasonable - given that it comes with a dessert too. Perhaps, they could offer additional rice too in case someone asks for it.

"So I want to say that our experience with doctor was amazing.  He worked us in on a holiday weekend when my daughter was three days old and having an issue.  The hospital wouldn't release us without the appointment, so I was very grateful.

Our problem has been with the billing.  Our appointment was on a Saturday of New Year's weekend.  I had both my insurance card and ID, but was told I had to pay for the visit up front because they ""couldn't confirm the coverage.""  They made me leave a credit card at the front desk while we were with the doctor.  I thought it was odd and it made me a bit uncomfortable, but I was also absolutely desperate to confirm my three day old baby was okay.  I was assured they would charge my insurance and reimburse me.

Fast forward two months, I get over my sleep deprivation and realize they never reimbursed me.  I call.  They never billed my insurance.  The man I spoke to was very nice and assured me someone at the front desk had messed up.  He assured me a check would come.  

Another month goes by.  No check.  I check my insurance statement.  The claim was paid.  I call.  I speak to the same man who tells me a woman handles the refunds.  She calls me back--""The doctor has to sign the refund checks.  You'll have it by the end of the week.""  That was a month ago.

So basically four months have gone by and this pediatrician's office has collected for the visit from both me and my insurance company.  I appreciate that the doctor's primary responsibility is to deliver patient care and I have no complaints there, but the doctors also set office policy and for better or worse are running a business.  I feel like my desperation to make sure my daughter was healthy was exploited.  I was treated like I was going to duck out on my bar tab in the office and have basically been double billed at this point.

1) hot and sour soup was BLAND. Literally tasted like chicken broth. No flavor at all.

3) asked if there was sweet and sour sauce in my bag (for the egg roll that didn't exist) and was told it would be $.50 extra! Really? $.50 for something every restaurant serves with their egg rolls? Umm no.

4) ordered the Mongolian beef extra spicy, it was milder than I'd ever had it there before when I ordered it regular.

5) Mongolian beef was 75% onion, 5% mushroom, 20% beef. I ordered Mongolian BEEF, not Mongolian onion.

And when I say random, the to-do list ranged from drywall patching (thanks to the mutt pack) to installing light fixtures and everything in between. I should preface this by saying that I have tried many times to hire a true handyman (individual and company), only to hear, ""Oh, sorry, we don't do that or that or this thing. But we can do this one thing on your list for you."" Not so in this case.

Jason was very professional in his dress and demeanor. He was helpful, friendly, and prepared (wow... I wonder if he was a Boy Scout?).

He hung doors for me, fixed knobs and locks, did paint touch-ups, installed some home audio equipment, ceiling fans... It was really a long list.

"This is a seller review, and I hope this would be the beginning to unveil the real face of these individuals and I urge other people to come forward and share their stories, I'm pretty sure there are many more out there like me. These people are nothing but a bunch of WHITE SUPREMACISTS. Racist low class individuals. I thought at first that it's only the person who was in charge of consigning my cars, but it turns out that they have a policy that comes from the top position and goes thru every level of management and down to the representatives that if you are not like them, then, they do not want you to consign there. PERIOD. The ignorant arrogant John Cook tried to trash the value of my cars from the very first minute i talked to him, in order to put me off, then eventually deleted one of my cars and added another one to run on the very same minute like one exactly like it ,so, both cars would lose value. They knew that this would be the only way to piss me off and make me withdraw my cars instead of facing a guaranteed huge loss on all of them. When i left a very polite message to the ""vice President of Consignment"" , Gary Bennett asking to have someone else take over my account, he never got back to me proving that, as i said above, it is a policy of the company, RACISM. My advice to everyone is to use the internet to find any car you are looking for at way cheaper price that what the same exact car would sell for at their stupid auction, and to the sellers, for way less cost and without having to pay those thieves $1500 ""lot fees"" before the sale just to consign the car then 8 - 10 % of the sale price, you can sell anything you want at so many different sites online.

"You know the saying 'Where do the chef's eat?' This, this is where they eat. The 2 owners started this place 10 months ago (both have been in the restaurant game, for years) and mark my words they will be expanding next year.

The decor of the establishment is inviting and shows their management has taken a course or two in branding. It's also a relatively spacious place compared to other take-out venues in Kensington. 

The turnover time for my sandwich was around ten minutes. The sandwich itself consisted of components that on their own were very good, but did not combine well into a cohesive-delicious-amalgamation-of-sandwich-y-joy that I had been hoping for. The steak was well-cooked and of good quality, but the pieces were were large and chunky, which made it impossible to take bites of my sandwich with ease. The size of the bun was far too large and overwhelming and did not complement the innards of the sandwich very well.

"Okay you see a 2 star rating, so it must be a bad review or perhaps I'm a disgruntled customer.  Not at all.  I liked the rental experience from here.  Now here's my say.

What I loved about this rental car company was how easy it was to rent and how awesome it was they don't up-charge for their satellite radio or try to up sell you on anything.  It was my first time renting an Audi, and the rep was very kind and explained all the dials an knobs.  And for that reason because of the guest service we get 2 stars, although because it was half of the experience they are more deserving of 2 1\/2 because they fulfilled their part.

Now what I hated.  For a newer joint out here in Vegas I was really let down with the quality of available vehicles.  It was a a weekend, but to only have one car available was beyond me, if I hadn't taken advantage of a discount I would not have gone thru with the rental.  The car I got, had real bad scratches on the rear which were whatevs but my biggest disappointment was how the rear trunk had issues which I can foresee people having real big problems with because the trunk kept opening up and if people travel with heavier loads or a more valuable things no doubt in my mind someone would risk losing their valuables.

I would get out of the car, lock everything up and the trunk would disengage and open up as I would walk away (thank goodness I always checked) and I would close it and it'd be cool.  I hated that it would continue happening often and I did not know what was causing the problem.  On the walk thru, the rep had the same problem even before we even started the car and same thing happened when I turned the car in.

Other issues I noticed were the tires were mismatched and it might have pointed to some underlying problems to the vehicle because the ride was just rough.  The brakes were subpar.  I do not understand how in 2016 there are still drum brakes being used, at least that's what it looked like my car was fitted with.  For these reasons this place gets 2-2 1\/2 stars.  Admittingly, I am still willing to try this rental service again just based off on how good the ease of rental and their guest service was.",1.0
"CAUTION! This location solicits for reviews and it is obviously affecting their rating system. They have fliers on each table offering a free drink if you show them a completed and posted Yelp review! This is wrong! That said, this was a HUGE disappointment! 

The bad (besides the HUGE offense already mentioned): 
The cuts of sushi are thick but poorly sliced. The Eel was burned and the BBQ sauce was WAY too sweet! Wasabi is a paste (which is ok since real wasabi is hard to come by) but this was so heavy in horse radish that it was terrible! The California rolls have a mushy mayonnaise paste like filling. I understand some sushi places do this and while I don't like it generally, this was inedible.  

The reason for two stars (instead of 1): 
Our service wasn't terrible. While she did forget our sake, but the staff was generally friendly and prompt. They do have some interesting specials. There is an all-you-can-eat option (both lunch and dinner) which is well executed and does leave dollars in you wallet. So that's a bonus. And the 2 for 1 drinks is a nice touch. While the sushi is mediocre, the all-you-can-eat and drinks specials are nice.

BOTTOM LINE: Sakana does NOT deserve the 5 star reviews it continually gets. It solicits for these reviews and requires a patron to show the POSTED review to get a free drink. (Naturally, this will encourage a guest to give a higher review since it must be shown while dining) This is appalling!

"I initially found this place during my hunt for Chanel frames that didn't cost an arm and two legs. Plus, I was looking for convenience. I work just an elevator ride away, and I wanted the convenient option of being able to run downstairs at lunch, pick out my glasses, pick up my order, etc., instead of having to drive somewhere else after work. I wanted quick, efficient, convenient, at a decent price point - and LF Optical delivered. Located in the Bay-Adelaide Centre, just around the corner from the food court, and in between deKefir and Second Cup, this is the perfect spot to consider getting your glasses, particularly if you work in the Financial District, since it's just a walk down the PATH. 

My prescription is pretty terrible, and coupled with designer frames, I've been quoted $800-$900 at other opticals (i.e. Lenscrafters, Hakim, etc). I ended up getting a pair of designer frames from LF, helped by the wonderful and knowledgeable Julia, for one third of the price I was quoted at other opticals. Julia ordered my frames, at no cost and no upfront fee, from a location in the USA so I could get the colour I wanted. They arrived within 3 business days, and I received my full order with lenses by the end of that week. Quick, efficient, and at a good price. Also note that a majority of their frames are discounted - their Chanel frames are currently 30% off at the time of this review, in case you're looking.

Staff: extremely helpful. I go in to this store to buy the refills for my car clip on visor air freshener. The samples of the scents weren't out for the refills so the sales associate when a of and beyond to locate samples from the back of each scent I was interested in. She also helped me identify ingredients in the scents that I liked and directed me to buy the corresponding body mist (get up sale).

"I came here in high hopes to get my korean chicken fix. They have lunch specials. They have the original style, spicy, and soy garlic flavors. I didn't get the spicy because my korean parents didn't pass me the ""able to eat spicy food"" gene unfortunately. My friend got it and said it was pretty spicy. I opted for the soy garlic and it's pretty decent. I just felt the chicken isnt as meaty as I wanted. Theres alot of fried chicken skin, not alot of flavor. Every time I bit into the chicken, I mostly got skin. There was a space in between the skin and the meat...meaning there was not alot of meat..and I like my meat lol They give you a bucket to put your bones in. They also have alot of other korean food. I didn't taste it because this is a chicken place, so uh I got the chicken. Ill probably come here once in awhile to get my quick fix (once every 6 months) but it isnt spectacular or anything.",1.0
"Exceptional customer service! Artemano really impressed me with their beautiful and functional pieces. 

The setup of the showroom is cozy and spacious. There are so many choices of different kind of reclaimed wood and even more rustic natural design. It is just so easy to find something that is perfect for your home.

Original price seems to be out of reach but just wait for warehouse sale or demo sale. During our visit, all the pieces were 50% off and some floor model even almost 80% off!!

"We rented Uhauls from Mail Plus twice. The first time last summer was a very positive experience. The 2 brothers working the store were helpful, accommodating and friendly.

We rented a truck and 2 furniture dollies last week. The girl who checked us out took us around the truck for inspection, but never had us confirm rentable items in the truck were sealed properly. We did not use the dolly that was in the truck. When we returned it, an older gentleman charged us for the dolly, because apparently the seal on the tie had been broken. It was only a $4 charge, but we shouldn't have been charged for something we didn't use, especially after paying for 2 heavy duty dolly rentals. When we tried to state our case, he abruptly cut us off in conversation, stated ""Nevermind, you wouldn't understand,"" insulting me. Then grudgingly told us he would credit the dolly charge, and walked out the back of the store, with nothing else to say. It was very rude, very abrupt, and he didn't want to listen to a word we had to say. 

We thought it was over after he agreed to the refund. When I logged into my credit card account, not only was I not refunded. I was charged TWICE. I had to file a dispute with my credit card company. 

I am very disappointed. This is the most convenient store for me to rent a truck at, and I like the European food market. However, due to the way I was treated, I will never return.",1.0

"Oh, Hello New York Bagel Shop in Charlotte!  If there is one thing I miss about living in NYC, it's the bagels.  I've been on the hunt for a good bagel shop for a while now that I've been living in the South for a few years.  Good biscuits - easy to find; Good bagels - and impossibly task.  Until one day after my spin class, I wandered into Poppy's.

I had a ham\/egg\/cheese on a bagel, which was super fresh and made that morning.  They even scooped out the bagel for me so I wouldn't eat so much of the bread!!!  So accommodating.

"Iv had two minor infractions with law in AZ and I have experience different law groups. One totally ripped me off and did NOTHING but humiliate me so I was skeptical reaching out for help at R&R. At first they seemed a bit sluggish with my case so I was expecting the worst but as soon as they got that court date set up...BAM! Jushin Gill (my lawyer) was so nice and answered ALL my questions. He was easy to contact, never made me feel like I bothered him and even responded to a weekend email I sent him! BUT I was still skeptical, after all it was just a speeding ticket. No matter that I was almost killed by an unlicensed driver, this guy wouldn't care to even read the police report till the day of, right? WRONG! He showed up at court like he was ready to FIGHT!!! He knew my damn case better than I did and I really didn't think that it was possible I could have missed any evidence but I did. Instead of sitting in the waiting area with me, he went right up and sat in front of the judge. It was like he was putting pressure on the judge to hurry up and dismiss this case if the cop was late. And MAN oh MAN that is exactly what the judge did! Lol, not sure if the cop hit a few extra red lights on his way to court but I sure didn't stick around to find out and neither did my lawyer. Guy knew what he was doing, worth every penny! I was ALMOST sorry to miss the show because Jushin Gill would have demolished that cop for the outrageous ticket he gave me...while giving an unlicensed driver a slap in the wrist.

My meal was great. I appreciated that there was an option for vegans. I enjoyed my coffee as well. The prices were beyond reasonable, as were the portions.

"All the fizzle and sizzle seemed to have died down a bit. I can't say I frequent this place as it's been nearly impossible to get a seat most of the time. But I have had my chances and have been lucky to visit about handful of times in the past 2 years. I must admit I did buy into all that hype a few years back and was impressed at first but as my taco taste buds have developed greater experience I am starting to become a little too snobby for this place I suppose.

The tacos are dry and I am hoping it's just a bad batch as of late. I don't recall them being this dry when I first visited a few years back. Pork belly dry, beef dry, fish... okay that wasn't dry but the taco shells are dry, dry, dry. I know, taco shells are supposed to be dry but I doubt they should be dry to the point where it sticks to the sides of your mouth if you don't chew them. Probably caused by the generous flour dusting on the shells as it touches your mouth forms a ""dough"" consistency thereby sticking to your mouth.

The flavours are strong but somehow lacks complexity. There seems to be a flavour imbalance of some sort. This is more of a fusion take on Mexican flavours as there are obvious Asian\/local flare.

"DO NOT USE THIS LOCATION - (they need a Zero star rating) This location is contracted with State Farm.  I was in a car accident and the rental was paid for by State Farm - State Farm is great, this Hertz location is horrible!  When I went to pick up the car, during business hours, no one was there in the office.  I had called an hour before and said I'd be there within the hour.  While waiting outside, two male employees walked right past me, didn't say anything when I said hello, I followed them inside and they both went to the back.  After waiting another 10 minutes a (nice) woman walked in and helped me.  I went back a few days later and decided to add insurance and the man told me it would be $69.  My car was being repaired across the street at Caliber Collision (a great experience with them), when my car was ready, I called Hertz and they said I could drop the rental car to them and they would give me a ride to Caliber.  I went to Hertz only to be told ""sorry we are too busy and can't give you a ride, just drop the car at Caliber"", that was fine with me.  Two days later my card was charged $210.16 by Hertz without so much as a phone call to tell me the charges.  The same rude man that walked past me while waiting told me on the phone ""we don't have to tell you what we charge you if your card is on file"".  He claimed that the man who signed me up for the insurance quoted me correctly and I must have misunderstood.

To me, the prices are reasonable for the size the cupcake--  however, the flavors were lacking to my disappointment.

I selected the salted caramel, red velvet, cookie dough and lemon raspberry. The cookie dough is great and is really like having two desserts in one. The lemon raspberry had no lemon or raspberry touch at all. Which was quite disappointing because the combo could have been amazing, had it any taste. Red velvet icing was great! You can taste the cream cheese and the cake itself was just the right density. As for the salted caramel.. No flavor. Nothing. Like eating a fluffy cloud. So if you're into that -- go for the salted caramel.

"The ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas Nevada"" sign is iconic, so much so it's literally in Paradise. It's as definitive and iconic as the Golden Gate bridge, the Hollywood sign, Milton-Freewater's  (Oregon) ""Home of Low Cost Utilities"" sign and the Sandia Peak tram. It defines the place. ""Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas"" reflects the city's character- it looks cheap, tacky, loud.. and who'd want it any different? It's got its own parking lot; people do wait in line to see it, like an object of pilgrimage. It attracts wedding parties, Elvises, you name it.

"I have been to Famous Daves twice. The first time I went to San Tan with my family and it was wonderful. This time at the Chandler location (which I am only writing the review for) I could not have been more disappointed. I have worked at a restaurant when I was young and I know the frustration with people coming in late at night but this was out of line. 

My girlfriend and son came in this last Sunday at 845 (they close at 10). There was immediate tension and annoyance shown by the staff when I asked for the television channel to be changed to watch March Madness. I wasn't trying to be rude at all only asking twice, but there was 5 minutes left and I didn't want to miss it ! Well the staff struggles to figure it out as I watched everyone looking so confused about to how to get that done. Either way I got to watch the last 45 seconds so there's the one star this review got. The food was very good our last visit so we were very excited to eat so that wasn't going to ruin anything ! We ordered the family platter ( feast for two ) that serves 2-3. Extra side of Mac and cheese because I remembered how good it was from the first visit, and two waters and one iced tea. The food came out in less than 15 minutes which was great ! Maybe too fast now that I think about it. We ate and enjoyed our meal, stayed till 945 and tried to leave so that we weren't trying to just lounge around till close. We even took home plenty of leftovers. 

Later that night at 1am, I had a family in crisis fighting over the two bathrooms in our house. All of us vomiting and having to use the restroom till we were restless. This had finally ended late last night. (This was also the first time we had all eaten together, my girlfriend works nights so she had just woken up and this was her first meal of the day.) Therefore, there food was the source. We called yesterday to alert them of the issue (not asking for compensation never would do anything like that) for the sake of other late night eaters that may go through the same thing. They told us a manager would call because only supervisor Paige was there and she could not handle the issue. No response that day. Called again and Paige said she must have wrote the phone number down wrong because she had called us and there was no response. Really ? Well that's when I knew I needed to write a review. Welp, that 50 dollar meal and 10 dollar tip was a waste, even threw the leftovers away because there is no way I could go through an experience like that ever again ! Just a warning, if you feel like the staff is pushing you out the door and half doing their job (maybe not even capable of doing it) beware your food may not be cooked correctly just because employees want to start cleaning before the place is closed. So Instead of me telling the manager, I have decided to write a review for all of you to know how my experience was. Thanks for reading.",1.0
"I am a retired first and second grade teacher.  After observing Nancy teach swim lessons a few years ago I knew with complete certainty she was the one for our granddaughter from Seattle to learn from.  After many many sessions in Seattle, Abby could not really do much except play in the pool.  After just one lesson she learned more from Nancy than in all the years in her group classes.  Undivided attention for 30 minutes with Nancy compared to 6-7 minutes in her group setting.  The rest of the time she would sit on the step and wait.  Private lessons do cost more but not in the long run.  
    Nancy gives clear concise instructions, models the correct form, has structure training, and her love of kids is obvious in the way she treats them.  If the child does not execute the correct move she calmly teaches and models until the child understands.  She praises trying, best efforts, and accomplishments.  Her background in Ironman and hundreds of triathlons shows her athletic ability.  But her teaching ability comes from the heart!

Yet, it's still my go-to Greek restaurant in Mississauga. You can't get much better than an open-faced gyro with extra tzatziki and some sriracha sauce drizzled on top. Pure heaven, folks.

The restaurant's always had really good prices over the years, and though the dinners can be a bit expensive, the portion sizes are huge. You pretty much have to split a dinner between two people - scoops of rice, big salad, plenty of pita bread and (if you're lucky) you might even get some honey sticks on the house.

The facility has state of the art diagnostic equipment and while some complain services are costly, I don't feel there is a clinic that can compare to what they have to offer.  The services offered are not ""pushed"" but rather suggested to maintain a lets healthy living.  Particularly comforting is to know they have an after hours emergency clinic.

It was cooked just the way I wanted it done.  It is really hard to find a steak sandwich like this anywhere else in the city unless you are going to this type of old school joint.  We all enjoyed our meals.

"Loved!!! Lovely restaurant, small space but cozy and well decorated. 

We tried all three broths.  The ginger chicken was my favorite.   Spicy miso had a kick to it and the kombu was the least flavorful.  They don't have a ton of flavor until you start cooking up your veggies and meats.  

I ordered the Ohio wagyu and found that the broth became very rich and delicious after cooking about 1\/4 of my meat. 

Other reviewers indicated that you don't get much food but we found that it was more than enough food and lots of fun.

"8-14-16: this is one star for my experience today.  Went to have a cut and color.   I had Jose who was friendly, we went over my color choice, but after he applied my color I was left sitting in the lobby for 1hr+ until someone else finally came to shampoo me.  After a 2min Shampoo I got my cut.  When I got to my car I noticed all the hair dye around my hair line, I'm used to some hair dye but this was all of my hair line, my entire hair line, in my ears, and the entire back of my neck. When I got home I started to feel itching as well.  I called to speak to a manager but the person who answered wouldn't even identify herself as someone in charge, she just kept saying ""yes?"" So I told her my issue about the dye and the wait.  All she said was that dye around the hair line was normal that they don't get it all at the shampoo bowl, but she could ask someone what could help take it off.  I've had my hair colored before, and I never left with this much dye. I didn't even get to the itchy scalp! I grabbed astringent, aquaphor and 10 cotton balls later there is still a faint outline.  
I call to ask for help and they won't even let me talk to someone in charge so I could explain the whole situation, they just made it seem ambivalent. 
I don't know if Jose was having a bad day, or if he just didn't want to get dye on his white pants (what colorist wears white?) but he didn't do himself justice today. 
I have fine thin hair and to be left sitting with hair dye for over an hour has now given my scalp that numb burning feeling  I went to wash my hair tonight  and the entire tub was colored red.  They didn't wash out hardly any hair dye. 

8-28-16 I initially deleted the above review thinking I had overreacted, but since it took 3 showers before I saw clear running water and I'm still having issues, like almost 2 weeks of my hair smelling like hair dye, my hair cut being uneven, my hair feeling lifeless, and my hair falling out every time I run my fingers thru it I thought I'd post it.  Now I'm back to putting my hair up in a bun or pony tail. So much for a new style

Saw the Yelp reviews called since we had an emergency. We had a leaking pipe in the wall in our bathroom and it was bubbling up the paint. The other companies we found couldn't come until tomorrow and we felt like it was necessary to have this fixed immediately before it got worse. Called at 9:30am they arrived at 11am. Quick service. My husband figured out that it was a screw that went through the water line when we went to hang a new bathroom mirror. My husband opened up the dry wall and the plumber changed the named and leaky pipe. The job cost $650 which I assumed seemed pricey although what needed to be done was handled quickly. We appreciate the prompt customer service. Since the job was finished we've been quoted a more reasonable price but there is honestly no price on piece of mind and the quickness that the job was handled before it worsened.,1.0
"I'm giving our experience one star and the only reason is because my fiancé and did enjoy the main course. We booked a reservation and were very excited to try out this restaurant for the first time. Hoping that this would be a good place for our rehearsal dinner next year. Unfortunately the venue is terrible if you want to have any kind of a conversation at all. It's so incredibly loud in the restaurant I literally am typing this the next morning and my ears are still ringing like I went to a concert. We even sat at a small table and were close to each other, still could only here every other word. Huge disappointment, we will never go here again and I certainly would not recommend this place for any reason at all. Oh and one more thing the lobster nacho's were literally a pile of black beans on chips, the lobster failed to join the dish.

"Spare yourself and don't come here. Worst service and nail job I've ever received. It feels like a disorganized factory assembly line and you are just being squeezed in and pushed through. My nail technician left me in the middle of my appointment without saying a word to explain. She was gone for over 15min because she went to take a walk in who needed eyebrow waxing. I was in a hurry so I asked someone to help me. The guy dismissively told me not to worry then walked away. He finally came back and sloppily slapped nail polish on my nails and hands. When I asked him to fix it, he gave me attitude and basically said that I'm in a rush so this is what i get. Me being on a time constraint shouldn't mean that I should purposely get a bad job done!

I went a little simple this time and ordered a medium well burger with mushrooms. It was very tasty, the beef was hearty and the mushrooms were grilled and delicious. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and I think this was my favorite thing lol. It was the sauce that got me. I want to say it was a mustardy sweet kind of sauce, it was very good. The fries also come with powdered sugar on top so you have your sweet and savory party in your mouth. 

I also tried the parmesan truffle fries which were amazing! The bold flavors really kick you in the throat but leave you wanting more. The truffle was not overpowering either so don't be afraid. They serve them with their house ketchup. Most places make their house ketchup with more of a marinara flavor, but not Gordon! This was sweet but flavorful and robust at the same time.

Now fair warning, if you got anxiety about loud noises or any medical conditions please be safe and travel with groups. Cause by yourself or one more person caused me to have a panic attack halfway through. The reason I give this review 5 stars is because the actors saw I was actually in need of medical attention and quickly helped me to the exit and even comforted me.

"I'm very disappointed in choosing this facility to be my OBGYN. First, the front desk workers are extremely rude. Second, when you schedule an appointment you don't actually schedule an appointment. This is something they don't tell you. I ended up leaving my last appointment after an entire hour went by. I was taken in back and checked in, and told to undress. I then spent 45 min in the freezing exam room. At which point I got up to leave. I told checkout I had to go. They told me it wasn't their problem that no one informed me that each appointment time books up to 5 people and they assume everyone won't show up. They told me waiting an hour wasn't bad and I should continue to wait because everyone who had made appointments showed up. I ended up leaving. A few hours later I received a phone call referencing me by the wrong name asking why I left since I hadn't been there more than 15 minutes. The third issue is the doctors are horrible. The first dr I saw disregarded the fact I was having extreme side effects from my birth control. When she called me for a follow-up she said she had no idea what I was talking about. I told her that was why I came in, and she denied talking with me about it. The second Dr I saw was Dr Norton. He is very unfriendly and not courteous by any means.

The (Norwegian) hostess was all smiles, she offered to arrange the roses I bought for my wife, and gave us a complimentary glass of bubbly.

We ordered the platter for two for $60, the tacos for $16, and a corn bread for $8 I think.  This was more than enough to feed one dude and two gal.  The food is a tad better than most bar restaurant; jack and milestones, etc.  So you are really paying more for just the chic atmosphere.

First experience, I found this business online, saw that I can call my order in, which is great because I was at work and needed to order for a few of us. After the lady takes my order she tells me I have to use my card in order to process the order. I wasn't about to do that when I had all this cash. So I came in and ordered. The cashier didn't say hello, or make me feel welcomed at all. She spoke monotone as if she were annoyed I was there. Then I sat down waited so long for my food. Listening to the cook get on the cashier over every possible thing. So I could imagine why she wasn't to pleasant. It took an hour possibly more for my food to finish. 

My second visit, today. Well, again, another pleasant cashier. People like to be welcomed into an establishment for that all around great experience. This place lacks that big time.

"I just don't get the hype with this place. Perhaps it's the matter of location after all considering the recent grand opening at the downtown location where the failure of Sears inhabited for many years before.  

I went by this Nordstrom a couple of times (during the weekends), it appeared to be quite busy with a lot of people as they just recently opened on both visits. But then again, will this store last in the long run?  The quality of the products they sell and the prices are pretty much as expensive as The Bay and other department stores, even more expensive than Sears when they were desperately trying to sell stuff in their final years with mediocre deals. The only things that stood out between this new Nordstrom store and the old Sears is an updated environment and newly hired staff members who appear to some what enthusiastic for now, And also a cafe and bar included inside, you know, just in case you really need an alcoholic drink to buy a $500 jacket.  

But is this enough to maintain a long running business? Only time will tell and if I'm right; just imagine me sipping a glass of iced tea as if it was none of my business :)

My husband will usually order something on special. We have tried the hangar steak (a butter knife can cut it), walleye, and scallops, and others I can't even remember bc I'm usually going into a food coma. And then, THEN(!) we cheese board for dessert. It's like a bed time story having the dear server describe each of the 15-20 cheeses and alas I must settle on a few.

"I am a huge fan of New Mexico style food, Carne Adovada being one of my favorite. I kept reading ""best authentic new mexican"" in the reviews. I couldn't disagree more. The food has an extremely heavy gringo influence for the worst. Could not serve this anywhere in New Mexico. I have never had Carne Adovada with pork that was dry and tough. As a cook, my guess is the pork was made days ahead of time and reheated (poorly). Then to make things worse, the adovada sauce had a distinct charred \/ burned taste to it. Cheese crisp had no crisp and was soggy instead. This is authentic to where I don't know other than here.

Not sure where all the great reviews are coming from. The only thing I can guess based on the crowd was that they have a lot of very loyal customers that are of the retirement age (or older)  and have been going there for years. Certainly nothing wrong with that. 

They had a full dining room with only 3 servers and one bus person and service was slow at best. I don't blame the servers as it was apparent that they were completely overwhelmed and doing the best they were allowed to do. Servers were even making the drinks\/cocktails\/margaritas for their tables. Wanted so much to like this place, but it was simply not a good experience. The owner \/ manager even came by and took our menus before we even ordered and without ever asking if we were done with them. In fact she never said a word to us. No one ever came by to ask how the meal was or to refill drinks.

They did take the uneaten Carne Adovada off the bill, thank goodness. Definitely won't ever be back.",1.0
"Used to be a five star joint. New management must've taken over because the place is ruined. Burger patties are super thin, bun is too big...gravey has been watered down...there's also one tall lady there who always messes up the orders and is super rude. Too bad. This used to be my favourite place. Now it's been added to my boycott list.",1.0
My family and i received very bad service at the buffet. When we complained the general manager of the buffett came and spoke to us and was even more unprofessional.  We used to really enjoy this buffett but we wont be returning unfortunately.,1.0
"Various choices of food to order! I used awhile for browsing the menu (want to try everything!) I'd ordered a blacken prime rib Benny and my honey got a egg stuffed French toast. Both are delicious!! And we've checked into Yelp to get each of us a free banana nut muffin which taste good too! Our server Amanda is great! She carries a big nice smile in front of every customers :) not that long waiting time (I arrived at 12:30pm and had around 30 minutes wait which is totally worth after I tried) will definitely visit again next time when I come to Vegas! Btw, hope you can win a trip to Disneyland Amanda! You deserve it ;)",1.0
"Great example of a Firehouse sub location. I go here a lot when traveling for work....but this visit was after a Cleveland Browns home game. Location is in a strip shopping mall, nice stores around....easy in and out. We visited on a Sunday night at 5:15pm. Short wait at the counter from 3 customers in front of us. I ordered a 12"" BBQ brisket, with Swiss cheese and tomatoes added, and my buddy got an 8"" club. Both sandwiches were correct, fresh and hot, and in front of us in about 4 minutes. Every table we noticed was clean and orderly, and the 3 guys working the kitchen were polite and friendly. Only possible negative was that the men's soap dispenser ran out of soap as I was using it, but I alerted the staff who went to fix it right away. If you've never been to a Firehouse Subs before, this is a great example to start you off....and if you're a regular, you'll get exactly what you're craving.",1.0
"So cool!!! When mentioned that I wanted to watch finding Dory, he brought me here instead of a conventional theatre even though it's a 50 minute drive from where we both live. I was blown away simply because I wasn't aware drive in theatres were a real thing.. only thought it was a thing in movies.. oops. 

We got there early so there were plenty of spaces to park.. there was also a bunch of cars parked in the way back early of the night.. so... ANYWAYS. I was warned beforehand to use the washroom in the restaurant we ate at because the washrooms here were dingy and lines were long - I didn't get to personally see it but he told me ""the guy's one is sketchy"" so I assume the girl's one is even worse. They sell food and drinks here, just like a regular movie theatre! I didn't get anything but he told me that he got chicken fingers once and it tasted like rubber. Ech.

Prices are comparable to any other movie theatre, $24 flat for two people, which isn't bad. They also have half price tuesdays and carload thursdays. 

If I lived in the area, I'd be here all the time! It's such a cute activity and definitely gives you more private time, if you're on a date. No having to hear coughing, snorting or chewing from random people and no worries about being kicked in the back of your seat. I'm a fan!

"By far the best mechanic shop in town! I've followed Fred and Liberty automotive through all his locations in Phoenix. When you find an honest mechanic, you stick with them! Fred and his team make sure my car is running in tip top condition and don't try to up sell me for other services! Even when they are busy they always make sure to keep me posted on how long it will be and if I'm not able to wait, I can either leave the car there or schedule time with him another day. I've never been disappointed in the service I've received! I would recommend Fred and Liberty automotive to everyone like I already have. :)",1.0

"I went to this location 12229 after work to pick up food for my pregnant wife and my self. Not only did it take me over 8 minutes to get my food as I sat at the window my order was completely incorrect. Normaly I don't do these surveys but it caused a major issue and we could not eat the food.
 From what I orders for my wife mild 2pc big box upgraded to breast with mash potatoes and coleslaw ( this is what she's craving).
For my self I ordered the 3 pc spicy tenders with Cajun fries for both sides and a extra side of red beans and rice.

From looking at the boxes I received all chicken no tenders. 
No red beabs and rice instead they give mash potatoes.
The fries where cold and old.
My wife couldn't eat her chicken cuz they gave spicy not mild for both.
Lucky she was Abel to eat both sides of mash potatoes and the Cole slaw while the rest of the food went into the garbage. I called the store before and told them the situation and the lady who answered the phone "" Popeyes can i help you"" I explained the situation and she stated ""well if you want you can bring it back"" I live in vegas and at this time it's rush hour me going to that store would take about 40 minutes there and back.

"I'm from the US and every time I've visited my cousins in Canada we've ate at Tehran. Over the years the prices have risen but the service has declined dramatically.

The food quality is still pretty good, the Barg is very tender and tasty. The koobideh is pretty good as well. Both types of chicken kabab are also good. The rice is good but the tomatoes are a little undercooked.

The main problem with Tehran is the poor service. The servers are stretched very thin and they had 3 servers for the whole restaurant. I genuinely felt bad for the servers. I don't know if the owners\/management are trying to save a few pennies by paying fewer servers but they'll lose customers this way. They've lost my family's business. 

I truly don't blame the servers, it's not their fault. They are stressed and stretched thin. The owner and management should be ashamed of themselves for putting the servers in this situation. A server told my mom that despite bad reviews they get busier every day. So as long as they get customers the cheap owner will try to use poor service to get himself a few more pennies. Shame on them.",1.0

"WOW. If I could give CycleBar six stars, I would. This studio is an absolute MUST for any athlete. Whether you use it to mix up your regular routine (I'm a marathoner) or as your go-to exercise, the workout will kick your butt and give back at least as much as you put into it. I have never done spin prior to CycleBar (found out about this studio at Clt. Pride) and after a few classes, yes there is a learning curve for newbies, you are hooked. I have raved about this studio to everyone who will listen. 

Good energy and positive vibes hit you as soon as you walk in the door. Super friendly and helpful staff greet you and get you settled in completely (from finding shoes for you, showing you how to check in on the iPads, filling up a complimentary water bottle, and helping you set up your bike).  You don't have to worry about feeling lost or uncomfortable if you're a newbie like me. You feel like you are a special guest of the studio as the staff is so attentive and plentiful. There are so many cool freebie amenities (hand sanitizer, chap-stick, towelettes, hair ties, fresh fruit, etc.) and the clean showers are stocked with products (and I love that they provide little plastic bags to stash your sweaty gym clothes in and towels - no carting your own back and forth). 

The workout itself is topnotch. The instructors, known as CycleStars, set the bar very high but don't make you feel uncomfortable as they remind this is ""your ride"" and ""your time to leave everything else at the door."" There are all types of bodies and fitness levels in the class. The CycleStars congratulate you at the door as you leave and are engaging with any questions, concerns, or general small talk (I've enjoyed getting to hear their fitness stories). There is a good mix of resistance training (hills) and speed work during class and I LOVE that they dedicate one song to an arm workout (my triceps are still sore from Sunday's class). There are some themed classes (my favorite is the Friday, Happy Hour 5:30pm class that concludes with a celebratory drink!)

Another HUGE plus for me is the stellar customer service. I have emailed the owner Lisa at least five times already (again newbie stuff) and she responds usually within an hour. Lisa always addresses my questions and doesn't seem annoyed with all my inquiries. The very prompt and responsive attention from the studio is noteworthy as I have not experienced the same awesome customer service from other local spin studios. The class also sends out feedback surveys after each class and thus far it appears as though they read and implement suggestions. 

The only ""negative"" is that my legs are a bit sore post workout so I can only do a few classes per week (thus far). I'm looking forward to getting in better shape so I can do more classes. Check out the website, there are still promotions going on at present.",1.0

I got the chicken shawarma plate. Large portion and rich in taste. I felt bad because I saw Chad throw butter on the grill so I asked him to remake the chicken for me.

But that's just my preference! I want to come back and try their other menu items because everything is made in house! 

They even have an array of hot sauces; sriracha, tapatio etc...love that just because it caters to everyone.

"This hotel is NOT a good choice for seniors! When my folks come to visit they usually stay at South Point. I wanted them to have an extra special experience when they came here at Christmas so I convinced them to stay at GVR instead. I personally love mostly everything about GVR so I was massively disappointed that the following was their GVR experience:
Upon arrival on 12\/23, only 2 registration desk workers were on duty so it took them 45 minutes to check in. Unacceptable. They were told to go to the East Tower, room 81xx. Of course, they went to the East Tower and searched for the 8th floor like anyone would do...but there isn't one. My elderly parents wandered around the hotel dragging their bags looking for this 8th floor that doesn't exist. (I also encountered several other guests wandering aimlessly looking for their 81xx room during the weekend and I was kind enough to give them directions, since apparently the GVR staff wasn't.) It took asking 2 staff members before it was finally explained to my folks that their room was actually on the 1st floor of the East tower and the 8 in their room number essentially meant nothing, unlike any other hotel we've ever stayed in. Once inside the room, they tried to put their clothes in the drawers but the drawers were painted shut so they called maintenance to unstick them. Then, my mom went to shower and the shower handle came off in her hand. Maintenance came again but the repair was going to take an hour at 11:30pm and they just wanted to get some sleep. They eventually moved to a different room. My dad really looks forward to waking up to a view of the mountains in the morning but from the 1st floor of the east tower, all you could see was the parking garage, so disappointing! The bed and mattress were so high off the ground that my dad couldn't get into bed. He had to climb on a chair just to get up onto the mattress. Each bed had no less than 8 pillows, mostly decorative. Lovely to look at but where do you put them when it's time to actually use the bed? The room was so tiny it was hard to find a place to put the pillows where they wouldn't be tripped over if you had to get up to use the bathroom at night. They couldn't even enjoy having breakfast together in the morning because the table in their room only had one chair. This room was so ridiculously small they can't even fit 2 chairs at the table!! What a HORRIBLE Christmas hotel stay for my elderly parents when I wanted them to have the most magical, memorable hotel experience of their lives. This was a huge disappointment. The hotel and casino look like a palace but apparently looks are highly deceiving once you're behind the closed doors of the hotel rooms in the east tower! Not to mention, the worst Christmas Eve meal of our lives took place in the cafe. The country fried steak was as tough as rubber, disgusting and unchewable! The shrimp scampi was a joke; I've made it better at home and for less money!! Another huge disappointment.
I will, however, gladly give an honorable mention to the best fish and chips we've ever had in Tides and a fabulous happy hour martini experience with live music at Hank's...those were the highlights of the stay. 
My advise: if you're wealthy enough to afford a suite, go for it, but the basic level rooms in this hotel are not a good choice for older folks. And finally...SHAME ON GVR REGISTRATION DESK STAFF FOR NOT CLEARLY EXPLAINING TO ALL EAST TOWER GUESTS HOW TO FIND THE ROOMS!!",1.0
"Went there with a few friends last week. First impressions are that the place is small, like extremely small. I was expecting something with a bit more room. The crowd can best be described as ""interesting"". Half of them looked like the stepped straight out of Yorkville and the other half looked like they stepped out of Jane and Finch.

I ordered the salmon and it was served to me basically raw. I pointed this out to the server and he apologized and said they were really busy and the chef had probably just forgotten to cook it. Really? Food overall could be described as mediocre. 

Would I repeat? At current prices, absolutely not. Service was professional, nothing spectacular, but the prices do not mesh with the food or ambiance at all. Cut the prices by 60% - 70% (we all know that won't happen) and yeah it would be a nice place. However, at current prices I simply can't recommend it.",1.0

Very unimpressed. They have one teller only at the first of the month. Waited in line for over 35 minutes. When multiple people asked why there were no tellers the greeter told us everyone was on their lunch. I don't understand why they need a greeter when they could have had 2 tellers. Someone had over 10 cash deposits and they still kept her as the only teller. One person in the back of the line made a scene and said she was going to leave her money and leave the bank. She actually got pulled to the front of the line and was helped. She might have been there 15 minutes total. I guess the moral of the story is make a huge scene so they take care of you? What makes it worse is their greeter\/customer service persons attitude. She deflected every single complaint instead of being apologetic about the wait she was going into how many required hours they have and talking about labor laws. Zero customer service. New management necessary,1.0

"Been here several times when it was still Bourbon Street Grill, always enjoyed my time. Since the new owners took over, we were curious about the improvements made, so we decided to dock and check it out. Told some friends we would pick them up here to jump on the boat. In retrospect this was a bad choice because there isn't an easy way back to the docks, without going through the restaraunt.  They had a small cooler they were planning on taking on the boat. Breakwater said they couldn't bring it through. I get they don't want anyone BYOBing, that is fair, but we are talking about walking through. C'mon. Strike 1. On the way back we had a grocery bag full of cans to recycle from an afternoon on the lake. As we were about to throw them in the garbage can on the doc, we were told from Breakwater that our garbage wasn't their problem. Thought he was joking, he wasn't joking. Strike two. We ordered some drinks on the main deck to hang for a bit and finish out the Badger\/LSU game. Six of us, plus a couple babies, sat down at a table on an empty deck after paying for drinks. Same guy from earlier asks us if we were going to be eating. Since we were not, he told us to move up to the third deck. Strike 3. Bartenders were great and accommodating, but this guy with a powertrip needs some learning disability level customer service skills. Lost us, but hope for their sake this guy gets let go. Didn't catch his name, but we were there in the afternoon twice on 9\/3\/2016.",1.0

The waitress was o.k, chatted very loud by the receptions. The curry had not that much sauce. A little bit disappointed.",1.0
"As new parents, we were thrilled to receive two items with tags and a gift receipt from this store. Upon realizing it was it was a 6 to 9 month item, we decided to return it for something else that would fit.  Within two days, we returned to the store, only to encounter a less than helpful salesperson who would not accept, nor give us store credit. To make matters worse, this employee phoned her manager and this person also denied us store credit. They suggested we ""regift"" the item. 
Needless to say, this was frustrating.  We wasted our time going to the store, we still have a useless piece of clothing (when it would fit, it would be too heavy for summer) and we had to deal with an obtuse sales Person. We like to shop local, but buyer (and gift giver) beware of

"Customer service is definitely not a priority at this establishment, in fact, they are doing you a favor by allowing you to be in their presence. We were ""greeted"" rudely by a hostess to be told that because there was going to be a 30 minute wait due to the fact that there were two of us and only one seat at the bar. They do not allow standing by the bar because we were later told ""they didn't want men hitting on other men's girlfriends."" She advised us to go across the street or elsewhere for approximately 30 minutes until we received a text. 

We went to the rooftop bar directly across the street, ordering drinks and then received our text immediately after. Having to quickly drink those and close out, we literally ran across the street to grab our now ready table. But wait, we had ten minutes to get back and we were there in 12 minutes. Literally TWO minutes late. We were told again that we had to wait because they gave our table away. 

When finally sat we were informed we could only order certain food items off of the menu due to the kitchen being backed up. We waited 30 minutes for 1\/2 of our party to get water...

I went to  gold and beyond. They didn't offer top dollar but they did allow me to haggle a little. Then in 30 minutes I had cash in my hand with no loan obligation,  all they wanted was a valid id.

"I went into color nation with virgin hair. Never colored in all my 26 years of life. I had my consultation and explained what I wanted. Balyage, someone who can blend really well and no orange. I showed her a pic of what I wanted. I made my appointment for the following week. I went in at 6:00 and ended up leaving around 9:30. I get it I have a lot of hair and we knew this was going to take a while but what I ended up with, I don't know how. I didn't realize how much I hated it until I straightened it myself the next day. The salon closed at 9 so by the time the color was done, I asked her to just straighten my hair and she insisted she just use a blow dryer and then had another stylist come over with her blow dryer and they both were drying my hair If I didn't feel rushed out of the door, I did by this point. I have huge frizzy hair so after the blow dry, I couldn't tell if I liked it or not, my hair was too poofy to tell. I didn't complain though, I just wanted to leave because I felt bad for keeping her there past closing time. I was told at my consultation  it would be around $150 and was told that each additional bowl of color was 10.00 each. I paid 250.00 and rushed out since they had been closed for a half hour so. Once I straightened my hair the next day, I realized she didn't color the top back of my head? She colored around my face only and then I go to check my receipt.... I was charged for an additional 6 bowls for color... I used a total of 3 bowls one included in the price so I should have only been charged 20.00 extra for color. I was also charged 40.00 for a haircut, I never got a haircut or even a trim. She said the style was also included in the price I never got a style. Just a blow dry. I called the salon and asked about the charges. The lady on the phone told me the stylist that did my hair was busy but she would talk to her and have her give me a call back. I never got a call back. I called again and was put on hold and then hung up on. At this point I don't want my hair fixed, I just want my money back for the things I was charged for and never received such as the 40.00 haircut and 30.00 for bowls of color I never got. I am so disappointed that I did all the research to find a good salon and figured I will get what I pay for. I would have been thrilled with paying 250.00 if I had gotten what I asked for and been a repeat customer but this is just ridiculous and I am mad at myself mostly for not taking the time to read over my receipt while I was there.",1.0

"There is a reason this Sephora location has such poor reviews compared to all of the others in the Las Vegas area. Whoever is the manager of this place needs to get his or her house in effing order! Every single time I come here, it's like pulling teeth to find help. It starts when you walk in and are promptly ignored while the sales girls titter to each other. When you finally give in and ask for help, they do everything in their power to give you the bare minimum help possible and look affronted the entire time. 

My recent experience was the last goddamn straw. I came into this Sephora ready to drop some $$$ as a VIB Rouge customer in need of some replenished supplies. Because I was ready to drop some serious coin though, I wanted to be sure this was the place that deserved my business. I walked in to silence, went to the first display - I've found in past experiences that a sales associate with the product expertise you're browsing tends to come up if you wait by what you want - only to have no one approach me in my 30+ minutes trying on different lipstick shades at the store. I moved from about 10 different displays at this time and passed about 10 sales associates (not an exaggeration) with testers in my hand. NOT A SINGLE PERSON APPROACHED ME. The only one who did - big boned girl with the shitty red dye job - glared at me the entire time I was using the center makeup station. Huffing and puffing around me like I was encroaching on her space. Do your job, heffa!

I will say that there were some customers with sales associates and they all had one thing in common - being older! Power to these women, most of whom looked like they did indeed need help, but just because we're young does not mean we aren't equally willing to drop $$$. We are the makeup addict generation after all.

"Garage door fell and wouldn't open this afternoon. I called the first company I found, and couldn't be happier (or luckier). The technician, Zack, happened to be in my neighborhood, so he was at my door within twenty minutes of calling.

I'm pleased with the work, cost, and warranty, and my door is working better than ever.",1.0
"La Rosa's pies are simply wonderful! The quality of their cheese and sauce go a long way to making a tasty pizza that is unique compared to the many bigger franchises in the area. Though they are marginally more expensive than let's say... Pizza Pizza, I would gladly pay the premium. The only reason why I didnt give them 5 stars is cause being so close to La Rosa has made keeping my slim figure increasingly difficult. Then again I'd rather be fat and full than thin and unsatisfied!",1.0

"Another cute little cafe at Yonge & Eglinton! When you first walk in the space looks quite narrow, but there's actually a small room at the back with additional seating (and wall plugs).

I got an iced latte and a chocolate cream puff and the total came out to be around $10.50 - a little pricey. The latte came in a fairly large mason jar (so hip) and it was actually really good - smooth and creamy while still retaining that strong espresso flavour - so I didn't feel too bad about paying over $5 for it. The $4 cream puff on the other hand left me feeling pretty ripped off. Now normally you would never hear me complaining about paying premium prices for pastries (because come on, it's an art form) but it was literally just a regular old cream puff, not too different from the kind you can buy in bulk at Costco. 

Overall: good latte, cool vibe, nice study spot, but pass on the cream puff.",1.0

If you, if you could return, don't let it wait, don't let it fade
I'm sure you're not being rude, and it's just your atmosphere,
It's teasing me to stay, I want to try everything.

I ate, I ate and it was good, and cocktails, oh yes so good.
So why am I holding back? Is that the way I stand?

Do I have to go to Linger? Do I have to, do I have to,
Do I have to let it Linger (Longer Lounge)


Spinning DJ, board game hoorahs, local draft beers, and cocktail specials; the linger indeed I shall and a littler longer as I lounge!  I finally made my way to this little gem.  At first the appearance of the place didn't seem to be happening and a little sketchy, but once I came in I realize this was definitely a spot I could relax and enjoy and few with some friends and be fine.

I ordered a draft IPA and shared the Prosciutto Grilled Cheese with fried zucchini with a friend.  A gal pal of mines went for the loaded fries which was all shared with the table.  The prosciutto grilled cheese was perfectly cooked; crunchy bread with warm melting cheese within, while the prosciutto provided a subtle saltiness to the sandwich.  The zucchini fries came along with ketchup and I believe to be a chipotle mayo.  I didn't care for it at all since I couldn't really taste the zucchini, but instead a crunchy mess.  The loaded fries were the star of the night.  Thick cut fries with jalapeno queso, bacon, chorizo, scallions, sour cream, and an over-easy egg.  What's not good with bacon and cheese!  With a hint of heat provided by the jalapeno and chorizo; boy my love handles are hating me, but damn it was good!

In the end, Linger Longer Lounge is a nice local bar with some lively pop to my surprise.  I rather enjoy the small town feel, but big town crowd.  The food is a hit or miss, but definitely not the loaded fries! - Enjoy!",1.0

"This review is based on the fact I only order shrimp and fried chicken tenders or chicken wings. For whatever reason, this location has the best shrimp, always fresh, sweet, and never overlooked. I always get 1lb (or more!) of shrimp, with hot n juicy spices and medium heat, and it never disappoints. Perfect blend of spices, lots of garlic, and a ton of butta! Chicken tenders\/wings are a perfect way to balance the heat. Definitely a place where you have to okay with getting down and dirty to eat and be okay breathing garlic for the rest of the evening. Food has always been consistent times I've been.

"I'm from Hong Kong and have lived there almost all my life, and this is authentic - from the food to the unceremonious service. 

It's not exactly a hole in the wall place, since it has nice-ish decor (good for a sit down dinner), but the service is definitely very HK i.e. servers are kinda curt and food is plopped onto the table unceremoniously. Nothing appalling, just typical of service back home where efficiency is everything. It's worth it for the food though! Very authentic and surprisingly good, especially for the one seafood item we tried. There are seafood specials listed on signs around the dining area, mostly all in Chinese, but worth a try. Besides that, they also have lunch specials (11:30a-3p I think) that are a pretty good deal for around CAD5-8 per dish if you're looking for a quick lunch).

We got:
\/\/ oysters in garlic \/\/ 
REALLY good! Oysters are huge and tender, and the soy sauce \/ garlic hybrid that the oyster is cooked in is delicious (I poured the sauce onto some fried rice and devoured it). Seems like seafood is pretty decent here! 

\/\/ vegetables (tong choi) stir fried in fermented tofu \/\/
Miss these vegetables dearly - portions are generous and it is prepared in the typical way, with the leafy bits soaking up the sauce and the thin stalks providing a bit of a crunch. The fermented tofu is salty and delicious, but may be an adventurous choice if you're not used to it.

\/\/ wonton noodles \/\/ 
I am quite picky about wonton noodles, but this is pretty solid. Noodles could have just a tiny bit more bite to it but the wonton itself is pretty good.

\/\/ crispy noodles with meat \/\/
It has the crispy noodle base, and the tender noodles soaking up the sauce on the top part.

Definitely pungent (without being stinky), but that's the way I like it - again very authentic and might not be for everybody, but it is pretty good.",1.0

As expected, the line was practically out the door. We didn't wait too long though and they were working quickly.  We ordered a ginger phosphate and a raspberry phosphate. Both good, but the ginger especially! Then we got the Gordon Square sundae (best fudge brownie I've ever had... So thick and creamy and not at all dry) and their root beer float (made with their homemade root beer!). The root beer was good, but what got me was the simple vanilla ice cream. Who knew vanilla ice cream could taste so amazing! It was the smoothest ice cream I've ever had (and believe me, I've tried a lot of ice cream).

"We used Creations in Cuisine food catering service and bartender for our wedding on May 21, 2016. We had passed hors d'oeuvres (3 choices) and a plated meal (2 choices) with wine service at dinner. We had a full open bar, we provided the alcohol and they provided the bartender and mixer package. Amy at Creations in Cuisine was great to work with and always replied promptly to emails. She was very flexible with us working on the menu and adding a few things last minute (linens, glassware, etc). Guests said they enjoyed the food and the waiters kept everyone's wine glasses full during dinner. The servers were good and meals were plated properly and timely. Guests said they enjoyed the food and there were no major complaints, so I would recommend them for sure. 

The one area I think could be improved was the bartender. He was fine and friendly, but didn't seem to want to do more than the bare minimum. We had planned to have signature drinks, but he said he never received the recipes even though I had emailed them to Amy a few days earlier. To be fair we didn't get him all the ingredients he needed, but I think a good bartender can fake it a little bit or get creative - he was just going through the motions. At one point my wife asked him for a glass of water and he handed her a Bud Light. He also didn't seem to know where some of the wine and liquor we had purchased was even though our day of coordinator said she explained everything to him. In the end it was fine and everyone got drunk and had fun, but that could have been a little smoother.

Amy also recommended a day-of coordinator that we ended up using who did a good job. So overall I would work with Creations in Cuisine again for good service at a reasonable price.",1.0
"I love living in 9920 apartments. I have lived here since July of 2013 and renewed my lease for another year.  The complex is very safe and maintained with lots of walking space and grassy common areas for my young daughters to play outside of the street. For a bit there was an issue with dog poop but they instituted stricter policies and almost every area has poop bags now and I haven't noticed any bad smells in grassy areas. The design of the apartments feel more like condos because there aren't that many units per building and they all have garages. 

Regarding interiors, I live in a two bedroom and have seen the smaller three bedroom. My two bedroom apartment has huge rooms but the master is a bit oddly shaped and my king size bed is a tight fit. My queen bed fit fine but if the bed is king and larger it's a tight fit. The bathroom is very large you can fit a twin size mattress in it in terms of length and it has two sinks with lots of cherry wood cabinets. I am not crazy about the bath\/shower, it's a plastic material that gets dirty immediately after cleaning but it is softer and that has been good for my toddler. The shower rods in both bathrooms are round and really add an elegant touch.  The closets are walk in-with wood shelving & plenty of room.  The carpet in my apartment is light beige which is pretty but not ideal for kids. The apartments has floorboards, very pretty wide doors and I love all the window blinds, they aren't the cheap mini blinds, the apartment has a lot of extra touches to make it look and feel nicer overall. The blinds in the glass sliding windows leave a bit to be desired in my eyes but they do the job. Tile in kitchen and bathroom is ceramic and the color is light but forgiving. 

The office staff, Lisa, Michael and Deea are always friendly and courteous and go the extra mile to take care of any issues or concerns I have. I work 14+ hour days during the last month of the year and Lisa and Michael really were flexible during the renewal process and took the time to explain all my options and work with my schedule. 

Maintenance is prompt and reliable. Ricardo and Cesar greet you with a smile and I haven't had any repetitive issues or repairs  that were done poorly or without care.  The biggest issue I've had in terms of repairs was one occasion my AC broke and they fixed the same day.

I gave the man my money I put it on the counter he slapped my money on the counter and walked away.

Dry, no flavor, over\/under cooked, the quality in general is just below par. You would think that having your meals included in your rent would be a plus but not when you still have to go out and buy your own food if you want something edible. If you are going to charge them for the food PLEASE improve it so they want to eat there. Also, I don't understand why you pay to get a parking spot, especially when it isn't even covered.

Should of left then..  they didn't have the suit we wanted in his size..ok..they put him in what they recommended a"" honey I shrunk the kid"" suit. I trusted them thinking this is what they do.

The lady which was called Mom by a guy there lost her marbles and proceeded to LIE to my face and say she told me when we pick it up they would have a suit there in the correct size. Never happened! She was aggressive and rude. I'm not sure how many people she has done that with. But I despise being lied to. She also said she gave us a discount for us waiting so long. Lie! I told her she must have me mixed up for someone else. I was shaking I was so mad.  This place ruined our experience! It's small, dirty, under staffed, unorganized, low inventory.

"Probably the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to when it comes to taste. To think it's located in the middle of Wisconsin, really sucks because I really dig this place. Anyhow they do serve alcohol here, which helps for most of you reading this review :).  
Let me get the negative out of here, I felt the service was pretty slow, like I had to flag down the waiter. there seemed to be a language barrier, but the other waiters that came around were hard to get a hold of but there was no barrier in communication.....and heck I speak all the langs they speak here lol Go figure! so when I saw communication barrier, I mean it!

Oh and ummm they could spice up the decor lol

Very Important !! They give you the option of picking the level of spice from 1 to 5. We had the food at level 3 and it was perfect to me, I could have gone up to level 4 but I wanted to share the cuisine with my one of my colleagues, he had level 3 for his dishes..... he was sweating profusely but said it was amazing. So if you dare or are tempted try level 4 or 5 :)!!! Lemme know how it goes!

First time ever I had the Dhaba Biryani that had shrimp, chicken, beef , and Lamb.... and the flavors were on point. Usually when you put those all in a combination they tend to clash and not be to appetizing. You won't regret ordering it......unless you can't handle spice :). Still craving it til this day.

"This was our first time at Famous Toastery. This place really has potential. I'm really hoping it works because the University area really needs more restaurant options. We arrived right at lunch time. The staff was polite. The gentleman that greeted us explained how the service would go. You'd have a team of waiters instead of one dedicated person assisting you.  They told us to sit wherever we wanted. We chose by the window that had a view of the pond. I ordered the New  Yorker and a flapjack. The New Yorker is basically a smoked salmon egg scramble. The flavor was good but the texture was off as it was a little on the dry side. The flapjack was very good. Great texture and tasty. The syrup is fabulous. My wife had the corned beef hash with hollandaise sauce. It was really good. However, nothing comes with it but two eggs. No toast, no other side. I would have expected more for $11. Also, they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I think we agreed that this place has potential and that we'd try it again. Although we do feel that it's a little bit pricey for what you get. But next time we'll pick other options to validate that.",1.0

The massage bar is greasy and melts too quick and you charge extra for the tin carrier you almost need to hold the messy bar in. The soap that cost around $17 bucks for an average bar of soap size disintegrated within a weeks worth of use...your only ""reasonably"" priced bath bombs are the only redeeming product in my opinion...and I cut them in half to use per bath. A purple one did stain my tub, and I dare not use the glitter ones...

"We've been a few times and have had both good and bad experiences. I guess it just depends on who's cooking and whether they're having a good day or not. There are always a few things that look really questionable like the whole fish dishes and the crab. Then there are a few things that we won't get again like the bokchoy dish, the cream cheese ragoons and the egg rolls. But a few of the tasty items are the coconut shrimp, the really thin chow mein (not the thick noodle one) the orange chicken, Chinese bbq pork, the mushrooms and the sugared donuts. The desserts are ""eh..."" but if you need to end with a sweet the little cakes are decent, along with the donuts. So overall, lower your standards, like really low, and you'll be ok. It's hard to find good Chinese in AZ, especially Chinese buffets but this one is decent enough. I'm sure we'll go when we need a Chinese buffet fix.",1.0

Secondly, I contacted Rick, the owner yesterday about 3-4pm and he quoted immediately and arranged me for a cleaning today between 2-4pm. He called me around 2:30 today stating that one of his business vans went down so one of the technician had to Pick up the slack do the other work. Needless to say, he told me that they'd be running late, it's cool, I get it, things happen. Better late than never. He showed up around 430, just to check the place and told me the van is on the way. Had a 20 min discussion about the NASTY pet smell from the previous renters left behind for my family to die in this beautiful home. I told him that my wife wanted the dining room done as well, and asked if he could charge me a bit more afterwards, he decided not to and to just throw it for free and for my previous military service he was thanking me for it. 

Joe, the technician arrived, and decided to go ahead and tackle everything without hesitation. I can't stress how serious joe was about getting rid of all the smell and the months of filth building up beneath the carpet. 
I figured since I'm the last stop before joe goes home, it's one of those ""I'll half ass the last customer of the day"" type of attitudes, but definitely not. He took care of me like I was the first customer of the day. Like I said, I can't stress enough how serious this company is about taking care of their customers.

The real triumph here is the fresh made soups and sandwiches.

BEWARE! DON'T SHOP HERE! They will promise you next day delivery and give you an excuse that the item that you purchased is damaged and cannot be delivered the next day.

It was originally the washer was damaged and now two times they tell me the dryer is damaged. They don't even tell you that the delivery guy will not show up the day you have scheduled. You will wait at home all day unless you call them. I have had to make myself available three times waiting for the appliances. Home Depot and Lowe's price match. If Spencers is cheaper just get the quote in writing and go to Home Depot or Lowe's. Your experience will be completely different. I would not have even given them one star.

"We have eaten here twice before and the food was great. Then we went last Sunday and it was like a totally different restaurant. The grits were basically not cooked sitting in hot water, it was terrible. The ""Cuban"" dip was not even edible - the meat was dry and grey (basically way over cooked) if I order something with ribeye on it... At least have it cooked medium! It was basically cremated dry grey ashes! We paid and when we walked outside my husband and I agreed it was never worth going back. 50$ for some of the worst food I've had in Charlotte.

"If you are only going to skate there, your review will be different and your experience will likely be different. I am writing a review for those that are planning to reserve a fire pit\/table to hang out there with their group. This was very average and nothing to write home about. I will not be partaking in this again. Firstly, it is a small skating rink so the sheer number of people on it is way too large for anyone that likes to free skate. Secondly, we ended up getting a fire pit in order to be able to sit down while we were there for 2 1\/2 hours. The table with the fire pit is cool and they even brought a lamp heater over as temperatures were approaching 32° F in Las Vegas which is cold for Las Vegas. The service is nice and everybody was very friendly. The menu is pathetic. In order to sit at one of the fire pits, you have to spend a minimum in that 2 1\/2 hours. We had to spend a minimum of $150. Food selections are all fast food and the most gourmet selection was a poutine with braised beef which looked impressive until it got to us... it was cold! The chicken pot pie was a deconstructed soup that was very disappointing. The cheeseburgers were average and just OK. These were the selections they offered. It is important to also know that it took a while for the food to get to us, and I cannot say that I'm OK with it because the food was less than impressive to begin with. There were no salads or healthy selections on the menu. Then, the drinks were less than impressive and there is no option for wine. The desserts were just boring and not very good. We ordered the Smore's dessert and the churros. Both were very average and nothing to order again. The pitcher of hot chocolate was good and the kids liked it.
Therefore, skating there is OK if there are not a lot of people around. One thing I will say that was cool is the following: we got there at 4:30 PM and we left a little after 7 PM. Exactly at 7 PM, as we were getting ready to get off the ice, they started blowing snow on top of the skating rink to make it look like it is snowing... Very fun and it was the highlight for us.
Therefore, for what we got, it was very expensive. Skating there is lots of fun but if you plan on getting a table\/fire pit there, expect 'fast' very unhealthy food with limited drink options and no wine option. Just a total thumbs down for me on that account.",1.0

"Located in the Yonge and Lawrence area, the rather typically tacky seafood restaurant decor of Lobster Monster is made up for greatly by the brightening hospitality displayed by Marianne, one of the owners of this establishment, all the way throughout the dining experience.

Of course I had to choose the lobster poutine--yes, with bisque--and needless to say it was a monstrous dish. Served with maple syrup for a dash of sweetness to top the Canadian theme, my only complaint about it is how monstrously stomach-heavy cheesy it was. Okay fine, they don't actually use cheese curds here also, but you're probably having too much lobster to care.

Overall a welcoming and fun place to enjoy lobster in taco form, lobster rolls, or just plain old lobster!

"I have been a loyal and regular customer at Celestin for its brunch and used to like the place due to its food and ambiance. However, after I visited the restaurant earlier this month for its prefix lunch, I was certainly not pleased with their service and food, especially with their signature steak, which is acclaimed to be 35 day dry aging one, but was not even close to it. What a huge disappointment and unpleasant experience!

After hours of wait without proper explanation 'why', steak was served; however, it smelled quite funny. Maybe, 'funny' would not be the right word to describe it; even 'disgusting', either. It smells like the mixture of strong raw miso and feces; rather close to later. Could you imagine how I and my wife felt after 1st bite? Anyways, that being said, we had to ask our server, who wore glasses with spiky hair, about steak, wondering what's going on. He explained in arrogant manner that it was a ""35 days dry-aged steak"" Wow, are you fxxxing kidding me this smelly shit is made of the best quality meat? I'm complaining your signature dish because I'm newbie to steak? Seriously?!? Trust me I'm a steak lover and have been top notch steakhouses not only in Toronto, but other cities like Vegas and New York. Even those renowned steakhouses usually carry 28 day dry aged, as I know. 
(Correct me if I am wrong) Honestly, I presume that Celesine's steak might have been dry aged for 35 days without proper care and ventilation, which might cause rotting decay. I wish whoever runs this restaurant read my review and explain better, because I am truly disappointed. From time to time, even Michelin 3 star restaurants might not be able to meet their customer's high expectation bar. However, when that happens, restaurants are expected to take corrective action to please its customers, instead of scolding them with high pride. Again, I'd be the last person to be called as 'claimer'. Please forgive my excessive words I used, but there is no other way to express my irritation.

The air freshener choices they offer are all ones that make me want to vomit.  I guess every thing went ok, it is just that when they were done with my car it smelled like dentene gum and cigarettes.

Its quaintly located in a shopping center off of Tropicana and by first glance you can't tell much but once inside it reminds me of a N.Y restaurant where only locals know bout it.  Very nice staff and they were extremely helpful in guiding my wife and I through the menu. Bulgarian food is great try the Sausage.,1.0
Where do I begin?! I am absolutely impressed with this company. From start to finish the service was top notch. The owner Martin was so helpful and communicated all information with excellent professionalism. I love that the company offers 24 hour service. I would recommend for any service you may need. The driver was actually the owner who drove my husband and I. Martin was on time and immediately offered assistance with our luggage and greeted us with warm smiles. He was on time and got us to our destination with ease and professionalism. The car was immaculate. Water is available for customers along with mints or gum. After a long flight I know that this is something that was very much appreciated. Martin is very good at making recommendations if you should need any of the area. I will be a returning customer and will most definitely be recommending to family and friends. Thank you Crown Sedan keep up the great work!!!,1.0

That should be the headline of your company, not Century Link.

When we signed the contract 1 year ago, you never told us you'll raise the price double after the promotion is over. Any sane person would refuse that, but of course you're hiding that from customers. Otherwise no one would want you! Your Internet speed is ridiculous too. I expect to be able to use it since I'm paying now $78! But you know what?? The connection drops every 10-20 minutes and sometimes it takes forever to open a browsing page. Because you're slowing down the speed, don't you? All the money goes into your pocket, and we get the slowest speed on the market. I cannot wait to be done with you, Century Link!

I hope dearly that you'll go out of business and not be able to rip off so many people.",1.0
"We finally got to try Pai after reading lots of good review on it. We had high expectation came in and we definitely weren't disappointed. The portion was decent, 3 people ordered 2 main dishes and 1 salad appetizer, we were all very full after. The sangria was also delicious! We really enjoyed the pad Thai and the green coconut curry! Highly recommended ! 

Another tip: try to get there as early as they open for the day to avoid long waits.",1.0

Tamara is AMAZING. She took her time with my thick, long hair and stayed past closing time to deliver results that were beyond my best expectations.

"Ever since I moved to sauga, I spent a lot of time reading insauga to see what's happening in my hood. One of the pages they had up on rotation was the top 5 rib places and lo and behold, one of them was close by my house! 

So I finally picked a day where I wasn't going to see anyone (read: I could sit at home in my fat pants) and decided to grab a rack of ribs for lunch. Lesson learned people: a rack of ribs for lunch for one person is redonk. It ended up being more like a rack of ribs for me and the mister for lunch and dinner and tomorrow's lunch.

Anyways, Brasas is a small little take-out joint with fresh ribs and chicken and egg tarts. You could also dine-in, but this place is quick food only, so no service. The place starts getting busy at the lunch hour, but they are efficient with the orders and seem to move at a good pace. The prices are quite a bit higher than I would've expected, but the food is GOOD. The amount of people that travel to that small plaza just for the food is a testament of how good it is. 

Note: they have two menus up for some reason, with different pricing, so I was confused and sad to have been charged the higher price. I expected as much, but if you want to raise your prices, take down the other large menu that's literally hanging above the pay area. 

The egg tarts were wonderful - flaky pastry with a lovely custard filling and the right amount of char on top. I found them a bit sweet, but everyone else in the household was impressed. 

I'm up for trying the chicken some time in the future, but would I grab a rack of ribs again? At that price, probably only for a special occasion.",1.0
"Late night rip off !
The first thing they care about is getting your credit card, then they give you a long pitch about how your pet is going to die at any minute so you need to sign a credit card for another $3,500 to pay for the care that it going to take to get her through the night and that might involve surgery and partial or full removal of a lung.  Very bad actors, long story that doesn't add up.  I took my pet to another vet within 20 minutes.. They checked her out and said the previous Vet doesn't know what she is talking about.  They gave me an antibiotic for her and in 2 days she was just fine.  This is the Typical Vegas type scam... get you in the middle of the night... get your credit card number and rip you off.",1.0

"I was excited to finally find a place that has Hong Kong egg waffles and just couldn't wait to come! This place is close to UNLV, so I stopped by right after my classes ended. 

The interior was super cute! I loved the wall art and all the decorations. 

You can get the waffles alone or with toppings of your choosing - they also have a pre-made combo if you can't decide! I got the matcha egg waffle combo, which was amazing. It came with green tea ice cream, mochi, and Pocky. The waffle was freshly made, which makes it all the more appealing. Overall, the dessert was very aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely get it again next time. 

I was a little disappointed in the honeydew slush I bought. It was a strange green color, I would probably describe it like a green highlighter. Seeing it was enough to make me think twice before trying it. It tasted just as weird as it looked, it was very sweet, did not taste much like honeydew, and left a weird aftertaste. I couldn't even finish half the drink. The boba was chewy and fun to eat, though! My friend bought the Hokkaido milk tea with boba, which was good. I'm sure their other drinks are good, but I don't recommend the honeydew slush.",1.0

Honestly, I was a bit shocked that the best poutine I've tried since I've been in Montreal happened to be at a shawarma place! There was a bit of a wait time with only one employee managing all the orders but worth the wait. I ordered the beef shawarma pita, sujok pita, manic poutine and some potatoes with their spicy garlic just to sample a bit of everything. All were delicious!! They're also very generous with the meat which is a plus for me. I've had a LOT of shawarmas in my lifetime from MULTIPLE places across Canada and States and this place knows what they're doing. I'm shocked at couple of the poor reviews but don't let it deter you. Will definitely return and recommend to others!",1.0

"Paying 70 bucks a month at the moment for tv and Internet. 

I was very busy with moving and have not had my TV in the apartment during install. The installation guy was nice and set everything up anyway. He did ask me if I want to schedule another technician out to check the signals for free. At the time I did not know when I will have the tv so I told him please mark down I will call in to make the appointment later. 

I bought my tv to find that picture quality is worse than Hulu and some channels are not there. So I dropped by the Chandler Store. Ryan at the store greeted me and after explaining the situation, he said he could only schedule one with a charge. I mean my signals were never tested out and he did read up the notes. It may not be his fault but he just couldn't do anything. I then asked another question regarding the payment that didn't go through on the Internet. I wanted to know whether they will run through the card again or I just need to make another payment. He said I need to call the billings dept. omg! Better training Cox please? I know there are different depts but staff should be much more resourceful than giving answer like please call someone else and I don't know. 

Then I made the call and guess what? After explaining the situation for 15 mins, she told me she can't schedule a technician when there is an outage? WHAT? so I need to call, wait, explain for the third time around because of AN OUTAGE and an employee that can't do anything more than please call and I don't know? 

I know that no companies are perfect but this is beyond reasonable. Why is it my problem that your bad quality service experience an outage and I cannot schedule an appointment during that time? 

Why isn't the staff at the store able to answer basic billing questions and willing to make calls or at least tell customers to not call during an outage? The store was empty at the time of visiting as well (nov 8, 16:00).

If it's not for the fact that I need Internet, I would cancel them with a heart beat. Don't waste your money with this company that has poor tv service and bad customer service.

"This is becoming my staple Birthday feast extravaganza.  Been here a few times now, and decided it was time for a review.  First things first, try and go during non peak hour times to avoid a wait for a table and having to walk a bit do to the limited parking.

Now it's all amazing from there.  Every time I have been here the staff and accommodations are amazing.  Today was nothing different. Our waitress was spot on in every aspect and I could not have asked for more.  The food was right out and we ordered a lot.  Four pounds of shrimp, a pound of mussels, two orders of nuggets, two orders of fries, corn on the cob, potatoes, and sausages; with a few different sauces to try. (Told you; birthday feast lol)

As with ever time prior the food is amazing, with more than enough flavor. The portions are beyond reasonable, and I have never left feeling hungry.

"Do not move here. New management took over in 2015 and everything has gone downhill since. 

It took the maintenance staff three different attempts (3 days) to fix our hot water heater. From what I've seen all they do is clean the system\/replace a filter before they even look at the unit and then we have to call again. 
The previous rental company brought in decent people that have lived here for years, and did a decent amount of profiling. This company brings in questionable tenants to fill up the apts and are gone within 2 months. There are children's toys strewn about the property when I take my dog for a walk and I have to avoid pet feces when I walk through the grass. None of these things were problems when we first moved here.
They are obsessed with notices. It took them over five months to remodel the pool and it was hot before they finished. I assume someone went in because there was a notice saying trespassing would be punished by law. Notices were just sent out about past due payments that would lead to eviction to half the complex. It turns out that their payment system malfunctioned, and they immediately turn on their tenants? Who are these people? If I could give no stars, I would. The cheap rent is not worth it.

It's a big park with plenty of seating. The dogs here were all huge when I took my tiny dogs. There is a tiny 'parklet' adjacent to this one so the little ones can go and run with their own size. It also had a lot more grass and looked cleaner. I just didn't go in because there were no other dogs in there. 

The people here are really nice and friendly. I liked it, it was just so mucked up with mud and dirt that it was really hard to enjoy it. I'm sure it's better when it's dry. I also wanted to mention there are train tracks that run beside the park and the trains make a lot of noise that scared my dogs to death, so be aware of that.

We especially enjoy this location here in East Mesa as the staff (Jennifer is the head Manager, Tara our hostess and Deb, our server) is great and we've become friends with them.  We drop in for an early breakfast in order to beat the crowd and enjoy fast, friendly service several times each month.  Enjoying an early breakfast has allowed us to make friends with the some of the staff.  

Tara always makes us feel welcome each and every time.  We're amazed with Deb's memory for details!  She never fails to bring us items that she knows we prefer.  We've observed her doing this for her regular customers as well which we find impressive!  Additionally, we appreciate how Jennifer (Jen) takes the time to briefly drop by our table to ensure we're satisfied with our visit as well as catching up with us.  She's hired a good group of people to make her location one of our favorite places to have breakfast.

Finally, we enjoy how the food (Chicken Fried Steak breakfast or the VIB are among our favorite choices) is consistently good tasting each time we visit.  Jen, great job hiring good line cooks!

"As far as ramen goes, Sansotei is as good as it gets. Good soup and good noodles. But be wary of the sodium, it's just too much.

I would like to say I am not the biggest ramen fan. The idea of a 10 dollar bowl of noodles with one egg, two pieces of pork belly, and miscellaneous items doesn't have the biggest appeal but I can appreciate it. It can make for a warm, and hearty meal.  

I've tried Sansotei downtown and found the Markham location just as good. I haven't tried the spicy tan tan (sesame) but have tried the tonkotsu ones and were disappointed. The salt just overpowers everything, and it's hard to enjoy the dish. I found spicy tan tan much better! It's less pungent and the heat provides a nice little kick. Do pair the spicy tan tan with thick noodles, it compliments better. 

As far the individual components of the ramen go, they really are amazing. The egg is perfectly soft boiled, the pork belly is tender. The noodles are perfectly cooked firm yet with a nice chew. The broth is rich, unfortunately just overdone with salt. 

Service was great and quick. We came on the weekend before 6pm and were instantly seated. This place was packed with a lineup just after 6 but with a quick turnaround time the wait shouldn't be too long.

I was a real buyer, ready to put money on a new vehicle and they have not only shown no real interest in getting my business, but then when they offered me a price in my vehicle, it was a pathetic offer.

Today I walked into your takeout section, was was blatantly ignored by your staff. Including a guy in a button up shirt, who I'm assuming is a manager? I walked in and stood there while they continued their conversations with cellphones in hand. Almost as if they were waiting for one of their other coworkers to make contact with me so they would be forced to help. Talking and laughing amongst each other and having personal conversations while helping me. Just so unprofessional. 

I came in, and although I made my order hours in advanced- when I got there my order wasn't complete....I ordered HOURS in advance. I get it, it may have been busy and no biggie I can wait a couple minutes. But then the girl helping me, asked the other girl to go grab my side items- it made me feel like I was a nuisance and she didn't even say sure! I'm sorry about that! Or of course no problem! It was a scuff and then came  back with hardly anything in my side cups. 

I just can't believe it, and as a manager I HIGHLY recommend that you review your staff and retrain them on how to deal with customer and guide hem on customer service.

"ラスベガスを訪れる日本人スーパーカー好きの皆さんには是非ここ「スピードベガス」に行ってもらいたい!!
196ドルから体験できる憧れのスーパーカーのコクピット。実際に体験したのはわたしではなく夫ですが、彼はまずランボルギーニLP-550ガヤルドを体験(フルスロットルパッケージ\/5周で345ドル)。この日はこの1台で満足しましたが、フェラーリも経験したくなり翌日もう一度行って、フェラーリ458Italia(アルティメットパッケージ\/5周で445ドル)を体験しました。
車好きさんには、この体験が素晴らしいものであると容易に想像できるはずなので、それ以外のところのレビューをします。
場所は、ホテル街からならI-15を南へ15～20分程度、Exit25(sloan)を出て左折して(I-15をくぐる形)すぐ左側に黄色い建物が見える、そこです。
受付ではipadを利用して、視覚的に分かりやすく進めることができます。わたし達は予約しないで行きましたが、問題ありませんでした。
まずは国際免許と日本の免許証の用意が必要です。
いくつかあるパッケージから、自分が乗りたい車のものを選びます。ランボルギーニLP-550ならフルスロットルパッケージ、のように。周回数は5ラップより（マッスルパッケージのみ4周より）。夫曰く、5周だと感覚が慣れた頃に終わってしまう感じだそうです。予算や時間に余裕があれば、少し周回数を多めに取るのがお薦めです。乗ってみたいだけなら5周でも充分。
ビデオ撮影のオプション(79ドル)はできればつけてください!!ストラップ型のUSBを渡されて、これにアウトカメラで前方を、インカメラでドライバーとインストラクターの表情を撮影したものを保存してくれます。PC等で再生すると、コース上の自分の位置、スピードメーターも同時に画面に表示されます。いいおみやげになる事間違いなしです！
ちなみに、カードで支払いをしますが、紙でのレシートはもらえず、メールアドレスに領収証が送られてくるシステムです。言えばレシートももらえるかもしれません。
受付が終わったら、情報が保存された腕時計型のデバイスをつけてコースへ出ます。
まずは、インストラクターからコースや運転についてのレクチャーを受けます。もちろん英語ですが、ホワイトボードに書かれたコースを示しながら身振り手振りで教えてくれます。
インストラクターは皆とっても親切です。こちらの片言の英語でも理解しようとしてくれます。彼らは皆、当然車が好きなので、スーパーカーに乗りたい気持ち、好きな気持ちをとってもよくわかってくれます。
あとはヘルメットをかぶって、インストラクターに同乗してもらってレースコース体験をするだけです!!
運転中も英語で指導があります。英語が得意でなくても、手振りと単語で理解できると思います。インストラクター席にはブレーキペダルがありますから、安心です。
0.5マイル(800m)のストレートでは是非思いっきりアクセルを踏み込んで、スピードとサウンドを楽しんでください。
同行者がいれば、レースコースのすぐそばであなたの走行の様子を写真やビデオに撮ってもらうことも可能です。すごく近いところで撮れますよ!!
終わったら、あなたが乗らなかったほかの車にも、シートに座ったり、写真を撮ったりして楽しんでください。きっと彼らはそんな日本人の姿を喜んでくれるはずです。
運転しない\/できない人でも、サーキット体験はできます。99ドルでドリフト2周というもので、プロドライバーの運転を助手席で体験することができます。わたしはドリフトにとっても興味がありましたが、ひどい腰痛のため泣く泣く諦めていたところ、インストラクターよりトップスピードを体験することもできると提案があり、ランボルギーニ・ウラカンに乗車することができました。プロの運転はまさにジェットコースター、ストレートでのトップスピードと、12か所のコーナーのステアリングさばきは実にお見事でとてもいい体験になりました。もちろん、これもビデオに収めてもらいました。
実は、誰も乗車しなくても、見学だけすることも可能です。受付で見学のみと伝えると、誓約書にサイン（サーキット内の危険について承知のサインですが、ゲストが出入りできる場所はおおよそ安全です）して、リストバンドをつけてもらったら自由にスーパーカーを見て触って写真を撮る事ができます。
これだけでも充分貴重な体験です。
現在はまだ仮設の建物での営業ですが、現在コース全体を見渡せるような建物を建築中です。
それが出来上がれば、ますます楽しい施設になると思います。
すべてのスタッフが親切でフレンドリー。日本語を話せるスタッフはおりませんが、そのことを心配して経験しないことの方がもったいないです!!
次にラスベガスを訪れたときもまた行きたい。その時はわたしも何か、乗ってみたいな!!

I was so baffled by this I walked in a circle for a minute trying to comprehend what was happening but needless to say, this place won't last long if they keep this up. They are in a brand new area in the center of the strip...Tourist surround you and if you're going to be a waffle bar that runs out of waffles at least give me a resolution, don't send me away empty handed. Horrible service, never tasted the waffles.",1.0
"I wish Tom's Urban had come up on my yelp search for New York, New York before I left for Vegas. It would have saved me a lot of time when I had just flown in and was starving. Luckily I ended up spotting it while walking down the street and decided to give it a try for brunch. It's really nice to sit outside on the patio and people watch while you're eating. I had french toast with a side of friends, and my friend had the omelette. Both were quick to come out and tasty. I would definitely be back.",1.0
"Today was my 5th time attending a zumba class here. I must admit, it can be a tad unnerving trying to keep up with someone half my age. Lalaine is an awesome instructor.  Even though she's one of 3 teachers that I've followed here at Namaste;  she's definitely my favorite.  She's so engaging and fun. She's mindful of us in the back of the room with the added cues and 2 dimensional moves. She's is so awesome and personalable. Did I mention that she's my fav?",1.0

"Over the weekend I ordered from Avanti Pizza through Eat 24. It was just too hot to leave the house. Having food delivered before relaxing in the pool for the rest of the day seemed like a great idea.

Online I easily found the menu with item descriptions and pricing. I made my choices and placed the order with payment in just a few minutes. I was quoted 45-60 minutes for delivery. Our delivery driver arrived within that time frame and was friendly.

The Mexican Pizza really hit the spot for me. The toppings were generously loaded and the crust was able to stand up to the toppings. I liked that the pizza had a taco sauce base instead of marina. The Avanti Salad was a salad large enough for 3-4 people. The salad was made up of greens, not iceberg lettuce and I always love that. There were plenty of the listed toppings including tomatoes, pepperoncini, provolone, onion, and black olives. The House Italian dressing on the side was actually a dressing that Avanti made. I liked the flavor of the seasonings in the dressing.",1.0
"I was referred to Rita by a close friend of mine. It was the first time I was taking something to be altered; my prom dress straps were a smidge too long and I needed them to be taken in. Rita was super sweet and helpful, I was charged $25 and the alteration was finished in a day. The way my dress is designed made the adjustment hard, so the dress was a bit too high for the neck. I took it back in and asked if she could re adjust it one more time and she did-with no charge! I had such an amazing experience with her and I am definitely going back to her for other dress alterations!!!",1.0

I've tried the tempeh chips (complimentary), sambal goreng tempeh, bopo chicken, holy basil, pad thai, and indo mac. The holy basil was too liquidy for me. Though they are usually not my favorites elsewhere, the pad thai and indo mac were hands down the best items I've had here and look forward to tryng them again (likely at the Taste). Service is very slow but very friendly; it's typically unclear if one should seat themselves or wait for attention. This summer, I waited for my companion on one of their small outdoor tables. I haven't seen other Indo restaurants around and their location on Willy St and John Nolan is mighty convenient.",1.0

"Matt is lucky to get a 2 from me. Email after email trying to get an update on my product for my b8 s4, Matt would hardly reply to each one at least 2 weeks later. It took more than 7 months to complete and he stated that one main piece was already made. (When his site says no more than a month to complete). I finally received my pieces and as I was excited to finally see the ""amazing"" quality, I was not very pleased. Bumpy and uneven clear coat  on most of the trim, with heavy orange peel on another and what looks to be a cover up spot on one piece. I can't believe for how much he charges that he would let this pass. The trim doesn't fit like they use too either. Charging big $$$ for his sub par quality is definitely not worth it especially when he doesn't give you any updates nor trust with your hard earned money....As for my deposit he did didn't redeem me after countless emails. 3 months later he finally pay pals me and doesn't even give me the full amount back. (PayPal fee) If I did a bit more digging into his company I would have never ordered through him. Customer service is complete crap and quality is not good for his prices.",1.0

We made a reservation ahead of time, which was confirmed this morning when the restaurant staff called me, and the food and service were both great. We were provided with 2 servers to help things run smoothly and it worked out really well. The only issues: one server forgot to bring my coworker her drink, but she apologized and made it right immediately upon realizing it; we had just a little back and forth with the order of the checks being passed out (almost all were individual). I really can't fault the servers, though...we were 15 people and 12 of us wanted our own bill. It was fixed quickly and all with a smile and professionalism. All in all, an awesome experience!",1.0
"Very bad service, lady (owner I believe) is incredibly rude. 

It's s not worth going here. Countless of other candy shops in Montréal that are better, cheaper and more welcoming. The owner didnt greet me or my friends (Apparantly she never does ?!) and came across very hostile (I'm not the first one to notice).

So I don't recommend going here, no candy in this store is unique and regardless of that it's still expensive. On top of that it's ridiculously overpriced and really nothing the store has to offer that is worth the horrible treatment.

Be sure and park at the City Scape Parking Garage on Washington just west of 1st St on the south side of the road.  A.B. will validate your parking for up to (2) hours so be sure and bring in your parking stub after parking in that garage.

We started out with the Pretzels and cheese Fondue along with the Crispy Shrimp. Both were delicious and I could see myself ordering again on another visit.  The cocktails were delicious and mixed well but were really pricey, most cocktails started at $10 and worked there way up to $14 a drink.  

The fish and chips were amazing--perfectly cooked fish and the tartar sauce was really good.  My wife enjoyed her fish tacos, and my pops said the food was amazing. He ordered the daily special which was a fried chicken dinner.

When I cut the fruit it just looks like that."" Then turned around back into the kitchen and whispered to the other girl working that she did put it on there and went into the back.

"Korean food..no Korean BBQ! Is basically what I live for! Its perfect for low carbers which my boyfriend and I are. Once every few months when we decide to cram ourselves with endless meats we go here because, unlike other Korean BBQs restaurants, this one you can get up and pick how much meat you want and that is freakin amazing. 

So picture this: Walk in, get seated to your table and have some drinks. Then you get up and get two plates: one for just meat and the other is lettuce that you can wrap the meat once its cooked and cut up into pieces :)

But since its a buffet the meat quality is...not pretty haha. Meat is good don't get me wrong! Its just when you are on yelp and see other Korean BBQ places and the meat is all marbled and nice so its definitely a little jarring but hey!

Their office staff is unfriendly, Dr. Shin is always running late-- even when I schedule the first appointment of the day, which I always do, after now having seen a different pediatric ophthalmologist we realize that Dr. Shin was incorrectly treating my daughter's eye condition. Honestly, in my opinion her practice is way too busy to properly give attention to her patients. Her schedule is at least 6 months out and we usually spend 3 hours there for a child's appointment! We only spent 1.5 hours at our new Dr. and the care was way better. I would not even attempt Dr. Shin's office. Unprofessional, always late, and rude.

"I have read a few reviews for this hotel and it just doesn't add up- what is everyone looking for?  I don't get it.  Excalibur is exactly what a hotel is supposed to be- clean, vibrant, and full of life.  Myself and two girl friends spent the weekend in Vegas for my birthday.  We booked a three-night stay at Excalibur and the price was magnificent- no complaints at all.

Upon arrival, we were greeted at the entrance and the door was opened for us by one of the employees.  The smell was fantastic, a perfumed smell throughout the casino floor, we didn't even know smoking was authorized as we did not smell one cigarette.  We checked in and went to our room.  Our room was exactly what we were expecting- two queen sized beds, flat-screen television, window view of the strip, and a clean and bright bathroom.  We were pleased with our accommodations.

The only complaint I have (and it isn't really even a complaint) was the lack of cocktail waitresses on the casino floor.  I played a considerable amount of Blackjack and it was difficult to get a drink order placed.  I stopped one of the waitresses and she said ""I'm sorry, but my area is over there"" and pointed to a row of tables across from us.  Ok, no problem, it wasn't a deal breaker, but it wasn't exactly convenient.

My friends and I also saw two shows- Thunder From Down Under (swoon, handsome Aussie men) and The Tournament of Kings (swoon handsome medieval kings).  Both shows were absolutely AMAZING!  NO complaints whatsoever.  I HIGHLY recommend you see those two shows.  For discounts \/ free tickets download the app ""Vegas Slots"" where you are able to earn ""loyalty points"" for free shows, food, gambling, etc.  I was able to redeem some of my points for free a free buffet meal, $50 in free-play gambling credits, and a free Thunder From Down Under ticket, YES!

On our final day we decided to rent a cabana in the pool area.  The spa staff were very pleasant and their uniforms were neat, clean, and tidy.  While at our private cabana we had a superior experience.  Cabana ""boys"" and waitresses stopped by frequently asking if there was anything we needed - very convenient for a day at the pool.  My only complaint, and not a deal breaker was the timeliness in which we received our food \/ drinks.  Perhaps a dedicated cabana wait-staff could be implemented.  

All in all my friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Excalibur Hotel- my mind still can't wrap itself around all of the one and two star reviews.  I think folks assumed Excalibur would be like The Bellagio or Caesar's Palace, it's not.  It's a fun place to stay that includes gambling, food, and poolside resort relaxation.  I will definitely stay at Excalibur the next time I am in town.",1.0

As for seafood, there was pretty much just cocktail shrimp and king crab legs.

Don't waste your money upgrading to any higher cost packages. The oxygen dried my nostrils out so bad I has nose bleeds for the next 24 hours (no drugs I promise). I've never had a nose bleed before this. I had to have my nostril cauterized when I got home.  I wrote the owner simply asking that he disclaim the fact that oxygen through nasal canulas will dry out your sinuses. He blamed it on the O3 that the casinos put out to clean the air. Sorry bud, I've been to Vegas a dozen times and that's never happened... Anyways, dry Vegas air, ""O3"" , and pure O2 through your nose is bound to dry you out. I was obviously too hungover to put all of this together, but you figure the medical professionals at Hangover Heaven would have mentioned this. 

So the treatment helped for sure. I felt better. The hangover was alleviated for the most part. 

** This is not a remedy for lack of sleep. So if you have been doing Vegas right and not sleeping, you'll still be tired. But you will certainly feel better. 

Main reason for the one star is because of the shitty service recovery offered by the owner. He made excuses and passed the buck. I have no respect for that. He did offer me some shitty hangover pills, but I let him keep those.  I paid $100 more for a package that offered no more benefit than the $159 standard package. And then I got to pay another $300 to have an ENT cauterize my nose.

"Wasn't impressed with the food at all.  My husband and I dropped over $90 on food that was mediocre.  Service was horrible, our server never checked on us, and we were sat at a table with no condiments like salt and pepper and no bread basket was given with our soup.  (We paid over $10 each for our soup.). Food wasn't bad, but certainly not worth the inflated price.  Service and food were both extremely slow and disappointing.

We gave Tommy Bahamas a second try.  So happy we did!  Night and day difference from our first experience.  Our server Jonathan and manager Dre were both very attentive, personable and had great suggestions.  

The view was beautiful sitting on the second floor with open windows overlooking the city\/mountains.  We ordered the scallop sliders as an appetizer, they were incredible...my only complaint is I wish they had more as they were so tasty!  The kitchen was much more prompt  this time. 

The lobster bisque soup was amazing with a spritz of lemon.   I ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sanibel Chicken which came with cauliflower mash and broccolini very tasty, and I will definitely be back to order again.  Both my husband and I throughly enjoyed this dish.  My husband ordered the Ribs which came with a cabbage island slaw and cauliflower chive mash, all very good. 

For desert we had the pineapple creme brûlée.  Light , refreshing and definitely would order again.

"One of the biggest adjustments I have had to make moving to the desert, being a person who grew up near the coast and trees, is the lack of nature near me. It's like taking the air that I breathe. Floyd Lamb park is a perfect fix for this, to get get some nature in and recharge.
   When you first walk up, you see this huge grassy field with some beautiful trees and some historical buildings in the distance. This place is huge! You start walking a bit further, and they start to appear. There are peacocks everywhere just hanging out. At first, I had to do a double take, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It was awesome. There are many different species of birds and animals on the grounds here. I feel like everytime I come here I see a new one. 
     There is a lot of tree coverage so it's a great place to sit and have a picnic and enjoy the sounds of nature. There are lakes to fish in or just watch the fish swim by. You could spend the whole day here just walking around.

I actually saw another doctor before him and am glad, I found Advance Plastic Surgery and used them instead.  I would have wasted a ton of money on doing a partial, since he fixed damaged core muscle that was not even examined before.  I also had zero idea of how intense this surgery would be, until meeting him and his staff.  It was scary, but had I gone into it differently would have no idea what to expect and be shocked by some things.  Recovery was good and I never felt once like I couldn't reach out to him and he even called me from his vacation to check on me post op.  I would tell anyone I knew to go to him and talk before making a final decision.  Especially if you are looking to correct a muscle, tissue or prior cosmetic surgery issue.",1.0
"I really wanted to like this place. I did. However, it failed to meet expectations. Maybe I caught them on an off day. I had the following items:

1. Iced Matcha Latte (12 oz for $4.00):
Three times the charm, right? They didn't make it right until the third time. I asked for soy milk but they made it with 2%. Then they gave it to me hot instead of iced. Finally, they got it right. Just to let everyone know, they pre-mix the matcha with sugar but it remains the bitter matcha that I love. I was pleasantly surprised with how bitter it was, but if you're into sweet matcha, this won't be for you. I just hated how it took the 3rd time.

2. Tiramisu ($7.50):
This was hyped up by one of my friends and it was probably the worst item. For the price, it's pretty small. Not only that, it was dry. The taste itself also wasn't impressive. Just straight out disappointed. In addition, $95 for the whole cake?!?! No thank you.

3. Matcha Mille Crepe ($7):
The size was also pretty small, and in between the layers of matcha cream, there is also vanilla cream. I'm not sure if that's what made it taste just like vanilla and nothing else. I could SEE the matcha powder but didn't taste it. It was very soft however, so I'll give it points for texture.

The servers were nice but they were really slow. I had to wait a long time for my order. It's pretty overpriced for what you get and if you're not rushed, then go ahead and try it out. I like that the iced and hot drinks are the same price because most places charge extra for cold. I also appreciate that they don't charge extra for dairy alternatives, but unless you ask, you wouldn't even know that is an option. I also want to note that there is only one tiny washroom which stores the WET mop which reeked. It was pretty disgusting. That just turned it off for me. The end.",1.0

Multiple issues were discussed and handle with no privacy. The front office staff is constantly gossiping about others when you walk in.

I do wish there were more bananas and strawberry toppings though since it costs almost $10. The ginger tea was strong in ginger flavor which was great. I also took home a bottle of kombucha, which is pretty affordable compared to grocery stores.

"I purchased a groupon for this studio for an unlimited month of classes along with a couple of friends from work. We signed up for our first class, Thursday 6pm barre with geoff, and arrived 20 minutes early just like the asked us to. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a woman at the front desk who asked us to fill out a small registration form and showed us where to sign in for each specific class. Other than that we were given no instruction as to where to put our belongings, where to find a restroom, which classes take place in which rooms, or what items we need to grab before certain classes. We set up our mats and things in the correct room after watching what others were doing and began stretching while we patiently waited for the instructor and others to arrive to the class. Right at 6:00, geoff came in and began class. Not saying a single hello or anything to anyone in the room. The entire class was very challenging and a great workout. As you can imagine, when you go to a new type of class with friends, you often look at each other and smile or agonize with each other in pain because of the difficultly level of the class. Fast forward to the end of class when we were doing the final stretches to finish out the class. Geoff instructs us to come up from this one specific stretch and he was already at the doorway walking out and he says ""Namaste."" Okay so apparently class was over? We grab our belongings, and leave feeling great and like we know how sore we were going to be the next day. 

So now today is Monday, 4 days later and we arrive again to the studio. This time for a Power 80 class with Casey. We were so excited and nervous all at the same time. We put our mats down in the yoga room (that we once again had to ask where to go) and because it was so hot in there and we were quite early, we waited out in the front for a few minutes. Casey approaches us and says ""Hello girls, I've never seen you in my class before, what are your names?"" We introduce ourselves and she tells us some helpful tips and exactly what we need to do for this class. She was so nice and friendly and the only one in that entire studio that made us feel welcomed. 

After waiting a few more minutes, Geoff approaches us and wow is all I can say. I have never felt more humiliated, disrespected, and attacked as I have in these few minutes talking to geoff. He told us how he felt WE were disrespectful in his class last week? He told us that he stopped class twice because of us? Really, because that did not happen, class was not stopped at any point, I mean besides the time when he walked out at the end without us even realizing class was over. He continued to scold us in the front lobby of the studio about how rude we are and how he wanted to ""throw us out of his class."" He was telling us how that class last thursday was the hardest class he had ever taught and barre is a discipline and how it affected the entire class and himself.  We apologized briefly, mostly so he would stop lecturing us like children. Now let me say, I can totally understand that IF IT WAS EVEN TRUE. We were not talking and laughing like he blamed us to be doing. We mouthed a few words to each other like ""this hurts"" or ""this is so hard"" but that is the extent of what happened in that class. I wasn't going to just bow down to him because he wanted us to. I told him that the feeling of disrespect went both ways and that there needs to be more instruction whether it be from the girls at the front or himself the instructor. 

Just wait, that's not all! After the conversation with geoff ended, we felt totally stupid even being there. We went and picked up our mats, and while we were getting our belongings and putting our shoes back on, we could hear the entire staff at the front desk (around the corner from the cubby's we were at) gossiping and talking bad about us behind our backs. What kind of business does that? We could hear everything they were saying and I have never felt more bullied in my entire life. 

We walked out the front door without saying a word and geoff chimes in ""Have a nice night ladies!"" Almost as if it was his goal to make us leave so pissed off. Correct me if i'm wrong but that is the last thing a business should want, is paying customers walking out the door to never come back. 

Long story short, we will not be returning. And all the other people we work with that have been telling us ""tell me how you like that yoga studio"" they won't want to waste their money there either.

The Shrimp Po' Boy features breaded fried shrimp, lettuce, tomato, pickle, cajun remoulade served on a toasted hoagie roll with a side of my favorite tater tots. I don't often order a Po' Boy sandwich but after enjoying this one, it might just be back on my items to order more frequently. The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but the Cajun remoulade is what pulled this entire sandwich together. 

Dora here. Not sure why hubby's short on words today. Hmmm. Anyway, the Chicken California Sandwich minus the mushrooms and avocado was moist and juicy and tender, and the bun soft and fresh. Delicious!

Reminded me why I like this place so much, and I admonished hubby that we need to come back more often. It's just a bit of a drive to make it a regular place. The food seemed to take awhile, but so long as the iced tea kept flowing, not a problem. :)

We would rate this restaurant 4 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving great food.

"We have ordered from here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Most recently, we ordered chicken fried rice, Buddhas feast, veggie lo mein, egg rolls, cashew chicken and kids sweet and sour chicken. Our total for all of this was $40 and we ordered it as carry out. (I have never tried the delivery). We had enough food for leftovers. The food was hot and there was plenty of it. Not salty and not greasy. One of my favorite things about this place is their use of fresh veggies. The dishes don't just contain book choy and onions. There are big pieces of fish broccoli, mushrooms, carrots etc.  the egg rolls are actually egg rolls - not spring rolls. The cashew chicken also had plenty of whole cashews. I'm actually surprised this place has only 3 stars overall. I've tried many Chinese places in Vegas and this one is by far the best, in my opinion. For this most recent order, my whole family loved everything and plans to make this the go-to restaurant for Chinese food.",0.0

"WOW! Not sure how to describe what may be THE BEST car I've ever purchased & from a dealership that gave me the BEST VIP treatment I've ever experienced. I started to order a 2017 Mercedes SLC300 that I would pick up at the factory in Germany. It's a long trip & would make me wait up to 6 months before it arrived in Vegas, so I did an internet search ""2017 convertibles"" and saw a car I'd never seen before ... 2017 Fiat Spider 124. SPECS: I wanted something fast, compact and with ALL the latest gadgets (backup camera, 7"" screen, remote everything). I'd already driven the German car so I went to test drive the Fiat. AMAZING! 0-60 in 6 seconds, zero noise or wind blowing at highway speeds with top down. Fiat 124 even BEATS the $55,000 SLC300  convertible BECAUSE it has pushbutton start (key can be in your pocket or purse) and top goes up or down in 5 seconds. Benz requires a key in the ignition and top up or down takes 23 seconds which can name a BIG difference when a sudden rainstorm appears. Warranties are identical (4yr\/50,000 miles). All this at HALF the cost of the German sports car AND it gets 20% better mileage!

Towbin Fiat made my choice even better. Aside from an UNBEATABLE PRICE (and I shopped Fiat dealers ALL over the USA), Vanessa Rau treated me like I was royalty from the minute I arrived at Towbin Fiat. She showed me many features as we walked around my new car. Then we went for a test ride where she taught me more. Ms. Rau even connected my smartphone to the gorgeous 7"" touch screen so I could get music from my phone, make calls & receive texts.  If you are looking for ANY new convertible in the Las Vegas valley and don't at least test drive the Fiat 124 at Towbin, YOU ARE CRAY CRAY CRAZY!!!",0.0

I'm not sure how or why it was made that way. Like I said glad I had an offer that just had me pay for the drink.",0.0
"Wow. So surprised at the one and two star reviews!  We started with the most tender calamari. Although the marinara sauce was a bit bland, but a touch of salt made it just right.

Dressing was served on the salad and it was a nice amount. We ended our delicious meal with a piece of tiramisu. Our server Matt was right on!! Very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. Our appetizer, salad and entrees were timed perfectly. I love salad and did not mind that my entree was served while I was still eating it! No problem it let my dinner cool to just the right temp for me to eat it comfortably.

"Went here as a group of 8 to celebrate my friend's daughter's talent show performance and we were told it would be a 30 minute or less wait.  Half the restaurant was empty.  Adults waited at the bar where the nice bartender who was both bartender and waiter took forever with the drink orders.  Asked the hostess twice after half an hour had passed how much longer and they said another five minutes, twice they said this and then they told us another 3 minutes. I asked if we could sit in empty area or even outside and they said they only had one server handling it so they couldn't??45 minutes later we were seated in the main dining area. Ordered immediately and drinks took another 12 minutes to come out and no straws either.  I had to get up and get those myself. Took another 30 minutes to get our food. And the food was mediocre and overpriced for chicken.  Wine costs $7 which is more than a local bar!! Needless to say we tipped badly and doubtful we will ever be back.  Management was nowhere to be found and when I asked for the manager they never appeared.  This place needs to retrain and add more staff as the servers clearly needed help and didn't seem very experienced.  They were nice the whole time while I tried to remain calm but I blame management who should have stepped in and helped out.  Should have comped our dinner or drinks or something too.  The prices need to be readjusted as it's way too high. What a shame.  Not coming here again.",0.0
"I wish I could give no stars.  The only upside is that I finally got my mirror and free of charge:

I will defiantly go to another location the next time I need something done by Toyota i.e recalls.  Otherwise, I will go to a mechanic outside of totyota.  I have had two bad experiences now with this location and have no desire to go back.  When I went the first time, I had to wait for a recall part to be ordered when I was told that the part would be there.  The person I worked with was quite unprofessional but I thought maybe this was just one bad experience. 
This second experience has showed me, however, that communication and customer service here needs to be greatly improved!  My passenger side mirror came off (just the mirror, not the entire piece) on a Wednesday morning.  I called ahead and asked if they had any in stock, and the man I spoke to in the parts department stated that they did indeed have one and I would just have to make an appointment.  I did so for the following day due to the fact that I am a full time college student and I work.  On Thursday I arrive for my appointment, but when the Toyota employee Mr. Guest and myself went to the parts department we were told that they did have a mirror but the system states that the location is unknown.  The employee I spoke to Wednesday failed to look at the location causing me to waste my time driving to Toyota when there was not a mirror there.  I then sat in the waiting room while Mr. Guest when to see if he could find the part.  An hour later Mr. Guest comes to inform me that he did not realize I was still here and that this whole time, someone had been looking over my car for things that need to be replaced.  I did not authorize this nor did I need this done.  I had come in for a mirror replacement, not a diagnostic.  
Mr. Guest informed me that he ordered the mirror and it would be there Friday.  I leave and come in Friday and waited another hour until Mr. Guest came to inform me that the mechanic cracked my mirror and I would need to come in for a THIRD time for a mirror replacement.  Mr. Guest informed me that the new mirror would be there Tuesday and that he would give me a call to let me know when to come in.  Tuesday came and went and I received no call.  It wasn't until I called Wednesday at 10 am and left a message with Mr. Guest to get an update.  I received a call back at 11:45 to let me know that the mirror was there and to come in at my convenience.  I arrived and he apologized for not calling Tuesday that he was out sick.  However, this being an inconvenience for a customer, I would think that he would tell someone when he called out to say ""hey can you give this person a call, she is waiting on this part.""  I left with a mirror on an hour later and a covered fee but the amount of time I had to deal with this dealership, in my opinion, is ridiculous.  I am in a customer service job and I understand how things can be sometimes, but the lack of initiative and customer service I dealt with has made me not want to buy or own a Toyota. Ever. Like I said, if I ever HAVE to go to Toyota I will find another location.",0.0

I visited this mid-century circular masterpiece of a flipped dungeon of a mini castle yesterday.  I booked for a free group tour (2PM) via davidwrighthouse.org, which they appreciate to be done to prevent too many people at one time attempting to fit inside the house.  Since they are very popular, I was booked 2 months in advance.  (I certainly hope this month's not the final month of the tour, due to a dispute with fussy (Arizona) neighbors!)  The rule is this:  when you arrive for your appt, you must park on the southernmost section at the parking lot of Camelback Church of Christ 5225 E. Camelback Rd next door and enter the House property through a gray gate with a sign on it and continue a long path towards the Small House, where a docent meets the tour group before heading towards the Main House.  Do not park on Rubicon Rd or nearby residential street for this purpose.  The back gate on Rubicon is for deliveries only; the docent or volunteer will not open the gate for you and would direct you to go to that church.  As I first entered the property, I felt like I was entering a commune or  UFO base (because of the dusty weaving driveway\/walkway) ;)
The 10-acre Arcadia gated property sits privately at the base of Camelback Mountains south of Camelback Road and was designed \/ built in 1952 by the master architect Frank Lloyd Wright, where it used to be all citrus grove and a bald mountain.  Currently, you cannot even see the the property off of Camelback Rd.  The House was purchased by a private buyer for 2 million dollars in 2012 to save it from demolition.  The Conservancy eventually restored it and are still maintaining the entire property- even the remaining Wright Family still occupies it (you can see their clothes in the bedroom closets ;) ).  This type of circular mid-century house is known for having had no garage, extra fireplaces, few bathrooms, and little storage space, as well as poppy colorful decors in geometric patterns.  The museum conducts free tours, educational programs, and welcome various events.
The docent, Phil Booker, an older gentleman who appeared fond of the House, gave an approximate 2-hour tour beginning inside the Small House and next heading towards the inside of the Main House and next outside around the House, including atop the roof.  It's as if he's selling the house and we were potential buyers.  He even asked each of us where we were from ;)  You are required to wear provided scrub-like shoe covers or your own clean socks to walk around inside the Main House (not Small House) to protect the original flooring and hand-made woven throw rugs.  Unlike other museums, you can TOUCH (gasp), so the atmosphere felt very relaxed and like visiting a family.  You don't have to stay very close with the group, especially if you walked away a bit to take specific photographs.  You can photograph\/videotape anywhere on the property.  At the end, you can fill out a card offering to support or volunteer the Wright House.  While the tour was almost flawless, I highly suggest to the staff to save visitors the time by placing a sign\/note at the church gate letting them know to first enter the Small House at the start of the tour- they, including myself, entered the Main House only to be told to go over to the Small House.  There were also boxes inside the Small House blocking the fireplace which made it hard to photograph without the unsightly box in the way.  Just keep the Small and Main Houses cleaner and more free of clutter; otherwise, the (working) bathrooms were clean ;)

"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. The food is always fresh and has a  great presentation. My favorite dish is stir fried eggplant with ground chicken in black bean sauce. It is so tasty. I don't like very spicy food so I just tell them 0 spice. I also love their brown rice, it's far more delicious than any other brown rice I've had. Their cucumber salad and crispy spinach are to die for. The restaurant is clean and they are very pleasant. The service is a little slow but that's because everything is made to order. I always bring friends and relatives who are visiting Las Vegas to Komol everyone loves it as much as I do.",0.0
"I love Nakama- have been going there every now and then for years. Sushi is great, hibachi is good as well. However, last night I decided to order a healthier version of my meal. I asked they could cook it without butter and with double vegetables, no rice.  (a simple request that most Hibachi restaurants are OK with). A few minutes after I ordered, the manager came out to ask me if I was allergic to butter- I said no just watching what I eat. He told me that if they busier, they would not be able to make my requested meal but if they were busy, they would not be able to make it. He wanted to make sure I knew in case I wanted to order again. While he was very nice about it, I found it troublesome that a restaurant that cooks everything fresh will not customize a meal while busy. Not a huge deal overall, but still would not come here if you are trying to be health-cautious.",0.0

"I've always driven by this place, consistently drawn to their unique sign, and finally decided to give it a try. My friends and I decided to stop by during happy hour on a Friday. To start, the restaurant was clean and nicely decorated, though nothing was as eye-catching as the sign outside. 

We were seated immediately which was also nice, however, their happy hour options were pretty limited and to be honest the food and drinks overall seemed a bit overpriced. I had a red lantern cocktail which was pretty delicious, but kind of small given the price (I believe it was $13-$15). I ordered oxtail fried rice which was a little greasy, but good.

One of my four friends didn't receive his order until the rest of us had already finished our food, perhaps an hour or so after we were all seated. It pretty much ruined our experience there since they had cleaned off our table by the time my friend received his food, which he said was only decent (he ordered the claypot chicken). 

Overall, the food and drinks were decent but definitely overpriced. I spent $35 dollars for one plate of fried rice and one drink, didn't seem worth it to me. Service wasn't terrible but the food arrived very late. We would probably not eat here again for these reasons.",0.0

"Went for a Wild Card NFL playoff game on a Saturday night with a friend. We both ordered beers, I got a Troegs (can't believe bw3 had such a non mainstream beer) and friend got an ipa. Server said friend had to get his beer in a sniffer due to its high abv. I got mine in a pint glass. Later we compare notes and figure out both our beers have the same abv. Not only did friend not get what he ordered, he got the wrong beer in a smaller glass, losing valuable liquid gold. He would have sent it back but our server was awol for quite awhile. Later on I ordered the garden something app with hummus. It was served w\/o hummus and I was told it'd be out in 30 seconds. Then told they were out. Server looked shocked when I refused it. Thankfully they did have hot pretzels in stock. Bathroom was dirty. BW3 is America's super generic sports bar.

"Small brewery, easy walking distance to Old Town and Scottsdale Stadium.  Parking is a little bit small but plenty across the street in the staples parking lot.  Other than popcorn they don't offer any food.  Pretty barren inside besides the brewing equipment. Beers were like a lot of the small brewpubs these days, mostly just like your neighbors homebrew but on a bigger scale but lacking the quality of some of the better other local craftbrewries such as Sun Up, Four Peaks, Huss, Papago and San Tan.  You can get growlers or cans of their beer to go on the off chance you find something to your liking.  Without any real food I don't see this place as lasting too long unless the beer quality improves.",0.0

"Just ordered from here for the first time. From the east coast so I like a real good calzone. Ordered a buffalo chicken calzone and mozzarella sticks.

The delivery time was pretty good, but when my calzone got here I had to put it in the oven because it was still so doughy and undercooked. Gonna probably try it again because everything else out here sucks but that might be it.

The manager truly does take pride in the restaurant. Even on a busy Saturday night he is always walking around and talking to every table to make sure that the good and service are exceeding everyone's expectations. On one occasion my husband wanted to order a particular lamb dish and the manager actually told him that he did not want to sell it to him b\/c it wouldn't be as good as it should be due to a delivery error from the food vendor.

"My family and I love going to pho places so when my aunt recommended this one, we went to try it out for dinner after a long day.  I have to admit that I'm pretty surprised that this place has such low reviews.  As I checked in on Yelp at the beginning of our stay, I was a bit wary while I ordered due to the low ratings but, nevertheless, we ordered as we would have anywhere else and we were not disappointed - maybe they're aware of the low reviews and stepped up their game that night or maybe it depends on when you go that the food turns out good or bad. In our case - it was pretty good!

We ordered two orders of spring rolls ($3.95 per order for 2 rolls - crispy fried rice paper rolls w\/ shrimp & pork, veggies, & taro) to start - they were pretty good - the sauce needed a bit more flavour but the rolls were cooked nicely. We had the large size chef's special beef rice noodle soup ($9.50; S - $7.50 ... there's no in-between size though) which had brisket, flank, & beef tendon, tripe, & beef balls. When you first get the soup it looks like there's almost no noodles but it's hidden under the meat and other ingredients - stir it up and the large bowl of soup was enough for our group of four (but if you come here just for the pho on empty stomachs, the large is good enough for two).  Broth was pretty good - average but I'd eat it again if I came by. 

We also ordered stir-fried chicken in lemon grass w\/ vermicelli which was good - not our fave dish of the night though - something was missing to round out the flavours($8.95). Our favourite dish was the grilled pork chop with rice ($8.95) - marinated with a sweet flavour and cooked well, I recommend this one over the chicken vermicelli dish. 

Overall, Pho Quinn is a good place for Vietnamese cuisine - service was friendly, quick, and frequent to ask how we were doing and the ambience is clean and modern. While the food isn't amazing, I'd say it's average or even a bit above and worth a try.",0.0
"Came here for lunch several times since it opened many years ago, but never did dinner.  Crab legs are cooked just right.  The shells break as they should, and the meat comes out in one piece, the sign of proper cooking.  Other places the meat falls apart and the shell is squishy - overcooked.  Many delicious staples, including a huge sushi section which is not my thing, but heard great things.  The real marker of a good asian buffet is my observation of the patrons - we were there on a busy Saturday night, and I looked around and noticed more than 2\/3rds of the customers were Asian.  Never in my life saw that at another Chinese buffet.  That speaks for itself, and speaks volumes - this food is the real deal!",0.0

When it was brought to their attention we were told that they didn't have any burrata. That should have been mentioned upon ordering or at least shortly after they discovered they didn't have any. It seemed a lot more like they were hoping to slip it by. Insult to injury, the waiter came out and said ""So, no goat cheese huh?"" Well, no, not when I ordered burrata. Then the music actually got louder. We were on the patio and were the only patrons. It was literally too loud to speak to each other or the wait staff.

Their portion sizes are way too small. I eat very little and never finish my food, so it's crazy that I'm complaining about portion sizes. Generally when we go out, we get 1 appetizer, 1 main, and 1 dessert to share. The first time we came here, we got the bruschetta, a pappardelle pasta, and a chocolate cake. The bruschetta was two tiny pieces. It was really good, but we would've had to order three of them for it to be enough for an appetizer. We left still hungry after that meal and it cost us around $75.

The second and third times, we went with a third person, and upped our orders so everyone had their own main and desserts, which made up for the portion sizing, but we still weren't full after our meal. 

The other problem is with the service. The waiters seem to seat us and then forget that they seated us. We were ready and waiting for almost 20 minutes before our waiter finally came back. Then once we finished our food, the waiter was nowhere to be found for another 30 minutes.

"We took the scenic tour out of Rockside at 9am in first class.  If you're riding first class, don't sit in the first car - sit in the second one past the bathrooms - it's much quieter in there. We were offered water, coffee, and vending machine type snacks which were a nice touch. The volunteers were happy to answer any questions and talk about wildlife.  No eagles spotted for us on this trip, but we did see their nest.  Even though the scenic first class tickets say on the website that you can't get out, we did and walked around Peninsula for a few hours.  It happened to be a beautifu day in February, so we really enjoyed ourselves.  There are hiking trails, shops, and restaurants to explore.  I recommend getting some chocolate from the Yum Yum Sweet shop and walking down to the Yellow Creek Trading Co.  Also, lunch at Winking Lizard was nice - especially their brown sundae.  In the summertime, you can take a shuttle from the Akron depot to the zoo, so that would be a fun thing to do too.  It's not an overly beautiful scenic tour by any means, but it's a nice thing to do and experience.  The best hiking is in Brecksville if you schedule enough time in the weekend.  Check out their nature center where you can hand feed wild birds on Sundays!",0.0
Amazing shops! Everything you can truly think of and so beautiful. Be prepared to break the bank!,0.0
"I came in on Sunday and was there a good part of the day to watch football with friends. Like any other sports bar, it's better to have each TV show with a sign as to which game is going to be playing on that TV.  This is primarily for the benefit of the bar and the employees. Serving is a tough job, servers not only have to deal with multiple food\/drink requests, they shouldn't have to worry about the science of picking which game needs to be displayed on what TV only to request it to be changed and another table get pissed off at that they changed the channel.
With that being said, with multiple requests I also feel it lead to the fact that it took 15+ minutes to finally get the drink I requested.  Now that was one factor, the other was watching the servers and how they were interacting with other people. Some were chit chatting it up with other coworkers for minutes on end. The biggest issue, the manager. He was more concerned with making sure all the single girls in the bar were happy with their beverages.  I know serving isn't the most fun job but it starts with a good manager and works itself down from there.  Make sure your employees are working, not socializing and get some signs on your TV's to display what games are playing on that TV and make no exceptions for channels to be changed.  P83 needs a good sports bar so I really hope this is taken into serious consideration.",0.0

"This place used to be kaba curry before Tokyo kitchen took over. They picked a good area to have this restaurant at. Walked in and was greeted by a lovely server sat us down pretty quick.

Beautiful inside too! Lived in Solon for years, and Imperial Wok has plunged downhill for years, with its stale shrimp chips, lukewarm wonton\/MSG soup, re-re-reheated fried rice, fortune cookies packed in the 1990's,  and hot and sour soup that tastes canned in comparison.

"Rooms are outdated, huge bubble in the ceiling from above room water leak, food on site is disgusting, no room service unless You stay for four or more nights. Pool is nice that's about it! So a few months ago I saw a Groupon for the Legacy Golf Resort for the 4th of July weekend.  It was a great deal...$300 for a 4 night stay at a resort ($75 a night).  Now I know why it was such a deal.  Day one we check in.  My wife has to use the bathroom as soon as we get in. I tell you this because when she flushed the toilet, someone else's waste came back up and clogged the toilet.  The maintenance guy doesn't show up with a plunger, but a plumbers snake. Obviously, this is a reoccurring issue. We laugh it off and head to the pool.  Long day of traveling and the wife and I want a cocktail. The bar at the pool has a big sign that the system is down to charge to your room. Back to the room I go to get my wallet.  Then we go to the resort restaurant for a nice dinner.  My son ordered chicken wings which about the only good thing that arrived on our table. Every thing else was or appeared to be frozen food.  No charging to the room there either. Fast forward to our last night there,  we aren't the family that needs every day maid service and its a good thing we aren't. Wife puts out the ""clean today"" sign on day the door while we were out.  Come back to the room to find it as we left it...no towels, no TOILET PAPER, and no trash emptied. Wife calls the front desk, and apparently they don't offer room service until you've stayed for four days.....with a roll of toilet paper!",0.0

Food: Mediocre to Ok. The dish i ordered was SALTY! That's why i kept drinking water. It was a noodle dish seasoned with soya sauce. The dish was below average in taste... I thought it was just salty and the flavor was very one-dimensional. The beef in the noodles were good; perfectly sauteed. I posted a pic of it on yelp! 

My friends ordered other dishes; i tried a bit of theirs. It wasn't that much better. For example, their fried rice was mushy and they only placed a few pieces of shrimps into it (how cheap!). That dish had very bad texture and was bland! Even I make better fried rice than that!

Environment: Very upscaled! The washrooms were very clean! 

Prices: This place is more expensive than other places I've been to! Dinner AYCE is $27.99 on Sunday (before tax and tip)! That's why i just ordered a dish instead! For the taste, the food is definitely not worth its price! You might as well buy food inside the food court at Fairview mall! A lot of the fast food places taste A LOT better and for less than half the price!

Overall, I don't recommend this place! Just because you go to restaurants for its food and their food is kinda shitty!",0.0
This company is very unethical and would never recommend them. They quoted me $50 for the work of the job was easy. It took the guy less than 1 minute to do the job and then he told my wife it was $130. They used a low price to get the job and the ripped her off. I would never use this company again and let everyone know to use a different company unless you want to be scammed and pay high ridiculous prices. I called and tried to at least negotiate with them to work on a fair deal and they would even budge on the price when they quoted me $50. This is a bad company and go elsewhere for better service and pricing.,0.0
"This place is somehow in my bookmarks list. Someone recommended it to me in case I go to Vegas. We were supposed to go to a buffet at the strip (Caesar's), but the line was too long. Luckily we found this place! 

This isn't too far from the strip. It's located in a plaza and there's plenty of parking. We came around 10:40 pm and got seated in less than 10 minutes. We also got our food pretty quick after ordering. It took them 5-10 mins to get the main dishes and a total of  less than 30 mins for everything else. My only complaint is that the booth that we got (located on the right side) was very awkward to sit on for me. I'm a short Asian person. Anyone who's probably 6' and muscular\/big build would sit comfortably in this booth. The seat is too far from the table. Other than this, everything is perfect. 

We ordered the Gangnam Combo and substituted the Green Salad and Koshitsu Pepper Yuzu for the Broccoli Cheese Fondue and Squash Tempura. The Broccoli is okay, not really mouthwatering. My favorites are the beef toro, Korean prime kalbi, 4 out of 8 of the banchans, Mushroom Medley, and the Oysters!!! The Oysters are definitely one of the best ones I've had.

"I haven't had too many instances where my experience has been completely off from what yelp suggested, but this was one such case. 
My husband and I originally tried for a table at Lotus of Siam, but were told that we'd have a 120-minute wait. So we walked around that complex, yelped, and decided to get dinner at Komol. We put our names down, and there were just a couple of other names ahead of ours so we were hopeful to get seated in about 15 minutes, but nope - took an hour and 20 minutes. By the time we got our starters, it was 2 hours and just then, we got a call from Lotus of Siam. In hindsight, we should have taken off at that point.
The Thai ice tea was decent, but it was all downhill from there. 
We'd ordered mushroom Tom Kha, but got a Shrimp one instead. The replacement soup tasted like... well it didn't have one. The baby corn had clearly gone bad both in our Chow Mein and Red curry.

I had a taco and two baos. I was stuffed! When I was looking at pictures of the bao on yelp, I'm thinking it's probably small, plus it's only $3.50, it has got to be so small! I was hungry, so I got three items.

While waiting, a girl walked down with her tray of bao and I realized I ordered too much lol. Don't get me wrong, the bao isn't ginormous. It's about the size of a baseball, but it is a lot more filling than  you'd think! By the time I had two baos, I was done! 

I got a tofu bao and I'm glad I did. At first I was reluctant because sometimes, the way tofu is cooked doesn't allow me to enjoy the food. This one, it was golden! They must have used medium firm. It wasn't tough, but it wasn't mush to the bite. I preferred it over my beef bao, which is something I didn't expect. 

I also enjoyed the kalbi taco a lot. The sauce was good and the kalbi was cooked well. It was perfect! I think next time I'll try the chicken.

"Maison Christian Fauré is an elegant pastry shop - as fancy as you can get in Montreal, anyways. I had wanted to try their creations for a long time, yet never made it to that corner of Old Montreal. We took the opportunity to do so after visiting La Grande Braderie at Marché Bonsecours in October.

It was around lunchtime, and the shop was packed. The decor was modern and the smell of warm pastries was amazing. No tables were available for lunch, so we bought a few items to go. It was a difficult choice: every single item looked beautiful and delicious (I would have gladly tried all of them, to be honest). We settled for a I-forgot-the-name tart, a piece of flan, a croissant and a cannelé. It was pricey, but not surprisingly so. We sat outside to try the pastries. Everything was very refined and well crafted, yet somehow the resulting experience was not as exciting and new as expected. Chef Christian Fauré had promised to revitalize the Montreal pastry scene, but he probably meant the ""haute-couture"" scene, specifically. Outside of that highly technical and select circle are actually many younger, adventurous businesses that are pushing boundaries, albeit in other directions. The pastries at Maison Christian Fauré are certainly world-class, but mostly French in spirit.

The guy trying to slide it by when called out tried to tell me that's how all rental car companies work until I told him I rent regularly from his competitors & perhaps I should do that now. He quickly corrected the price. However when I began reading the contract due to the dishonesty already demonstrated he began sighing loudly & stated he had other customers to help. I told him to cancel me, let me speak to a manager, & help them. He again checked his attitude & became very accommodating. I told the outside clerk about my experience. He was very polite, apologized, & asked me to fill out a complaint card as they do not want that kind of staff. He gave me keys to a car that looked like a steel brush was dragged across the top with deep scratches in the paint on top. I went thru 3 cars-one wrecked, all very damaged before getting an somewhat decent though still damaged car. 3 other customers were having the same experience while I was there.

"This place is tucked away in the corner of the lot like a hidden gem. The shop has a nice sitting area outside to take in that morning dew with your coffee.

Sitting area is comfortable and along the walls. It sure does beat Starbucks in seating availability.

I like to start off with yellowtail sashimi. With 8 pieces costing $12 it's a pretty good deal. Additionally the fish was a nice temperature and tasted fresh and tender. Each roll that I've tried has also been a delight. First off the Oh My God roll has a smokey eel flavor that is not overwhelming but compliments the rest of the ingredients well. The H3 has a spicy kick that most japanese restaurants don't have, it might be a korean thing. The caterpillar roll is melt in your mouth from the fresh avocado to the eel. I've had the chance to try the mango crunch roll which has a sweetness to it mostly from eel sauce, the mango I found was a bit tart and made the roll a delightfully light flavor. The oasis is covered with cucumber instead of their signature purple rice, it's cooling and refreshing for summer, but I'm not a huge fan of that much tuna.

Yes I had a big order but EVERYTHING on my order was wrong. When I came back to get everything fixed the Manager ALEX was very rude and extremely unprofessional! He has no interest in fixing my order all he did was argue with me about why it was wrong. When speaking to Alex, a young boy interrupted me and said ""Actually I made your order"". Even though I had all the food brought back, and the receipt to show they messed up on my order QUEN the employee there argued and blamed the other employee who was training for why my food was wrong. QUEN even was even more unprofessional and rude then ALEX the manager was. Alex, who left to the back claiming he wasn't here when we made the order so he has nothing to do with it walked to the back when QUEN still stood there arguing with us. It took for the very nice and sweet assistant manager RYCHELLE to come out and apologize for both of their actions for me to get my 
Order replaced. I will never visit this location again just based off of this one experience. I would advise everyone to do the same!! The store manager and district manager should also be aware of the kind of employees they have working in their store! QUEN even took it so far to tell RYCHELLE she needs to hurry up with replacing the food so I can leave because he was about to ""Spazz"". What kind of customer service is that? Save your time get a better experience at a different location.",0.0
"The ONLY negative I can say about this little jewel is they had a Liverpool banner hanging. Good staff (while a bit short-handed), great beer selection, and not only a proper fish and chips but one of the best I have ever had. Glad we found you, we will ABSOLUTELY be back!",0.0
"This place is legit.  Went here with the Husband on a Friday for dinner.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the ambiance.  For an appetizer we had the crispy shrimp.  I was really excited about the shrimp because I'm lowkey ALWAYS craving crispy fried shrimp and this place didn't disappoint.  Perfectly fried, seasoned, tasty batter, clean shrimp, and the peppers they served tossed in with it are fried as well and aren't super spicy.  For my entree I ordered more fried food....Dont Judge Me...I had the fish and chips and the fish was reeeally good.  Definitely recommend.  My Hubby had the Jambalaya, which he said was good, but could've used just a tad bit more seasoning...He still ate it all though and enjoyed it.",0.0
"Just as good as the reviews say it is and a pretty good meal at a good price.  My wife and I ate there this morning and had to wait over a half hour because of its popularity.  The restaurant is well run and well staffed.  I watched a very young man scrub, not wipe, table after table as he prepared them for their next customers.  The man in charge of staging the wait and filling the tables did a great job and even came around at the end of the meal to make sure we were pleased.

My wife had the breakfast wrap and thought it was excellent.  I had the western omelet and pondered the choice between hash browns and potatoes.  I chose the hash browns and was a little disappointed.  They had a watery taste and I suspect the were steamed on the grill with water and a cover to ensure they stayed moist.  The problem was all the water was not cocked out and it diluted the oil normally used to give top hash browns their best taste.  The western omelet was very good.  Next time I will try the potatoes.  The final bill was about $21 and well worth the price.",0.0

I have never come across such a rude tsa agent ever. The agenta at Las Vegas airport obviously think they can be rude without consequence. Me and another customer followed the signs for 1st class and the agent told us we should go wait at the back of the other line and did we think we were better than everyone else because we were traveling first class. He made us wait until he felt like we were humbled and embarrassed enough before checking out I'd and boarding pass. People like him are what gives this country a bad name and causes the divide that exists. I hope he realizes that the customers he is so rude to are patching his salary. The guy needs to go to church and learn to act right.,0.0

"Been to this place a few times.  Usually I avoid it on the weekend due to the extremely long lines but since it was a holiday I had no choice.  When I put my name in I was told it was a 25 minute wait.  65 minutes later we finally got a seat.  I don't necessarily mind waiting but please try to be more accurate than that.  On to the food.  My party ordered the blueberry pancakes, ham I am, and a side of eggs and bacon.  The pancakes were big enough to feed a small army and from what I saw on other tables, they were puny.  Ignoring the ridiculous size, they were quite tasty and filling.  The ham steak was also delicious.  The prices seemed quite reasonable considering the portion size.  The blubbery pancakes were $7.99 and they could easily feed 2-3 people.  If you have time to spare, check this place out.",0.0
"Amy and Meghan were a pleasure to work with for our wedding block in March 2016.  They were responsive and helpful.  Some of guests requested late check out and it was just fine.

"Came here on a whim 'cause the sister and I wanted to share a meal before I had to head to work. It was the first time too. 
Cute restaurant and overall theme. Kinda funny how Christmas decorations are still up XD
Staff was nice and informative. They checked on us a couple times, and it sounded like they knew a few of their regular patrons well. I had wanted the SOB, but they had to substitute it for the similarly crafted Sloppy Jose, and I was not disappointed. Shredded\/tender chicken with a salsa verde sauce and overeasy egg on a freshly baked bun. Who can be let down by that? Not to mention that my mocha with peanut butter was pretty good - reminded me of a subtle peanut butter cups. 
My sister liked their Frittata of the Day. She just wished that she had more of it 'cause it was about the size of a slice of pie. Enjoyed the toasted bread, salad with vinaigrette, and a side of Chai Latte.

"I've been going to 1up barbershop since opening and personally getting my hair cut by Gabe for several years now. 1up is 17 miles from my home but it's worth the drive every time. Gabe is a master of his craft. He's a magician with the clippers. His attention to detail and precision is unmatched. I would definitely recommend anyone to Gabe if your ready to have that life changing haircut.The shop is very clean and has a very laid back feel to it. A nice big flat screen tv, usually with sports being played. Every barber there is very friendly, professional and will cater to all your needs. No matter your age, gender, hairstyle, etc. you will be taken care of. This shop is a shop for everyone. Also, another thing that is clutch is their appointment setting app. You can set your appointment with your preferred barber and guarantee yourself a haircut at your convenience. No more waiting around for hours on end because who like waiting?                                      Don't wait. If you're reading this, your search for a good barber shop is over.

"A girlfriend of mine raves about this place, but mostly for it's craft beer selection. Which, is pretty epic and I found two new delicious winter beers to obsess over. 

We each ordered a gyro. I always opt for sweet potato fries but was shocked to see a $3 upcharge on my bill at the end. I looked again at the menu and the price tag for the sweet potato fries is completely covered by the fold in the menu. Bummer. 

The gyro was a gyro. My friend's regular fries did look amazing though so I was extra - salty - about my expensive sweet potato selection (they were good don't get me wrong but the regular fries definitely were better). Oh, and the bartender wasn't really friendly at all. 

So yea, lots of great beer! The menu did have a lot of potentially delicious items which I will definitely go back to try. My friend said their buffalo chicken is good, so that is next up on my list.

This is very good pulled pork, served on a fresh bun (pulled out of the wrapper as you watch!) and served with optional slaw on top or on the side with a couple of sides available.  This is an indoor, sit at a picnic table and get your chin greasy food place, and they do very little else.  But what they do, they do quite well.

Although they specialize in korean noodle soup, the one dish i would recommend is the bbq herb samgyupsal. This grilled pork belly was tender throughout.

Unlike other shows, I was pleased that we got down to the meat and potatoes when Elton started the show promptly without any extra bands.  For some this might add value to their concert experience but when I pay to see someone, that is who I expect to see.

"Last weekend, I went to Las Vegas for my bachelorette party.  We booked a Terrace Suite at Planet Hollywood last month.  A group of 6 ladies.

We arrived early so our room was not ready.  We checked our bags at the bell desk.  When our room was ready, we went back to get our bags from the bell desk.  It was a very busy weekend, however, when my maid of honor asked if we could take the dolly up to our suite with all of our bags the bell desk said, ""No.""  Then she asked if someone would help us with our bags up to our room and he again said, ""No.""  I was unaware that this happened until we got up to the room.  So I called the front desk to speak to the manager, whom apologized.  I also asked for more towels.  30 minutes later, we still had no towels, so I called housekeeping to ask for towels.  They said they'd bring them right up.  Our group of ladies had to share towels because we were getting ready to go out.  At this point it had been an hour.  I called again, and they said they were backed up and had someone on their way.  So I asked them to leave the towels in our room so they would at least be there when we returned from a night out.  We went to a club and two of my friends came back at 1am--STILL NO TOWELS!  So my friend called the manager irate.  The only way we got towels was because my friend told the manager to stay on the phone until we got our towels.  This had been 8 hours from the initial request for the towels.

This is a suite, mind you, that we spend over $1,000 on for the weekend.  

The bar area in our suite had a wet carpet, from some sort of leak.  The front door was cracked, like someone had punched it, or tried banging the door open or closed.

We brought food up to the room the first night and left our trash outside the front door.  The person who brought towels did not take the trash.  The next day, when someone asked us if we wanted room service, did not take the trash away.  We ordered room service the next day and he did not take the trash down after delivering our food.  

After two nights and three days, our trash from the first day was still outside our doors.

To top off this awful experience, when we were getting ready to check out on Sunday, we noticed on the opposite side of the suite there was a large men's white tee shirt left on the table.  It had yellow stains and was none of ours!  THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

We took the shirt downstairs and showed it to the gentleman at the front desk who checked us out.  He was so apologetic and could not believe we even touched the shirt.  

We could have stayed anywhere on the strip, where hospitality and competition is high.  We could have spent over $1,000 at any other place and I'm sure would have had a better time.  
My bachelorette party was only great due to the friends I was with.  Planet Hollywood is awful and I will never stay there again, nor would I wish this experience on anyone.  I felt bad for my group of ladies who spent plenty of money to celebrate my marriage and I feel that I let them down by this experience.  I don't even know what else to say.",0.0
"This place really is as amazing as everyone says, but the wait is also real.  We arrived right after our flight around 4am and still had about a 60 min wait.  As many others said, there are few seats at the bar, so if you have a big party, expect a longer wait.  Luckily, there were only two of us, so we were able to squeeze in between parties.

We also went during a time where it was a happy hour, which included cheaper wines, beer, and raw oysters! We ordered a dozen raw oysters, which were delicious and fresh.  We ordered the bouillabaisse and the pan roast, and the bouillabaisse was amazingggggg. Contrary to what others say, I thought the pan roast (by far the most popular dish ordered) was just okay to me. But it's probably because I really enjoyed the fresh seafood and lighter flavors of the bouillabaisse (although by lighter, there was still a lot of butter put into the soup).

Comment from Boba S. of Kung Fu Tea 
Business Owner
9\/19\/2016  Hello KATHIE

I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts and opinions about the Kung Fu Tea franchise.

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he ""should"" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 ""I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy."" 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed.",0.0

"Food - great pho place. Above average for what it is. I ordered pho with beef tendon and beef ball Thai style with a side of roti with curry. The soup base is very light yet tasty. Just the right amount of flavour. The Thai style makes it spicy. Didn't have to add anything to it. Highly recommend if you're a fan of spice. Very flavourful!! Highly recommend.

The roti is one of my favourite things on the menu. GET IT. The roti is crispy and flaky on the outside and soft when you bite in to it. The curry sauce is very strong in flavour. Even my friend who wasn't a big fan of curry enjoyed it (so it says a lot). Just try it.

Location- alongside the busy Korean town part of Yonge. Park alongside the side streets. It's pay for parking. 

Service - it was just alright. 1-2 servers at the time. When the Restaurant got really packed you'd have to constantly flag them down for things like napkins (they don't have napkins on the table... they only give you like 3...and with roti it gets messy!)

"The return policy of 30 days is incredibly stupid.  I bought my son some clothes for his birthday, you know I was thinking ahead.  When to return them 32 days later and the rude ""manager"" was snotty and said that the ""policy"" is 30 days and that they couldn't return them.  I will NEVER shop at Sears or Kmart again due to this policy.  When I mentioned to the cashier about buying gifts for Christmas, I was told that they change the policy in December to 45 days.  They make concessions for the holiday season, but not for the entire year.  I then went to Penney's and their return policy is 45 days.  So long to Sears and their affiliates.  I am tired of the customers being treated like second hand citizens.  I can't wait until they go out of business due to cruddy customer service.",0.0

"I've often laughed at the fact that people write reviews for fast food chains, but two big fat middle fingers to the Jimmy John's franchise that permanently soiled my opinion of all other Jimmy John's franchises. I already found the chain shady at best due to its founder's love of big game hunting, but tonight I found myself in a pinch and decided that I could temporarily put my principle's aside to feed the family ""freaky fast."" After ordering $30 worth of food I asked for two cups of water. I was told I would have to PAY for them. Seriously, shame on you for your greed. I've never in my life been asked to pay for dirty-ass AZ tap water. I also ordered a sandwich with no mayo because my youngest child is allergic to mayo.

"My first experience riding on a train for vacation was from Edinburgh (Waverley Station) to London (King's Cross). From start to finish I had a pleasant time with a few hiccups along the way.

First pro is that Waverley Station is along Princes Street meaning you can literally shop your way to the station. The station itself is connected to a small mall where you can grab a bite to eat (it has a decent food court) or pick up last minute essentials.

After a little bit of shopping I made my way down to the Virgin first class lounge. I started looking for it, but gave up and asked for directions because my bags were getting heavy. I was excited to see that the lounge had been recently renovated with plush seating, little lounge areas and my new favorite cocoa\/ coffee machine. Snacks were plentiful, but the only big downside was that the wifi wasn't working! We had an employee try twice to fix it, but he wasn't able to. Big bummer since we we anticipated making online reservations for things to do in London.

The actual train ride was pretty relaxing. The train ran on time. First class food service was enjoyable. Every single time the cart passed through they gave us our choice of food and drink. Edinburgh was the start of the trip so we had the full selection of food. They do not replenish food along the way so later stops had a smaller selection. I enjoyed the food on the train and had fun trying everything throughout the ride.

Cons for the ride is that wifi is spotty, but I was still able to use it to purchase west end tickets for that night. Bathroom was small and a little dirty (think airline status). Finally, alcohol is supposed to be in the cost of the ticket, but isn't served on weekend trips. I didn't miss it, but it is a shame that the ticket wasn't any cheaper since this perk was missing. All in all I would love to take another first class trip with Virgin East Coast!",0.0

"Apple and bacon pie with maple ice cream. 

Now that I have your undivided attention, let's start at the beginning. That was my dessert. 

L'Orignale is hard to find if you don't have binocular vision. It's just round the corner and into an alleyway off Rue Notre Dame (Rue Saint Alexis) in the Old City. 

This place is the perfect combination of a métis voyageur's cabin with a demon craft cocktail bar. All the waiters are dressed like Paul Bunyan with their checked shirts and all. 

The food is French and Canadian wilderness. Hearty yet imaginative. Not afraid to take small yet appreciated diversions to excite the palate. 

I knew what I wanted before I even walked in the door thanks to the street-side menu. Rabbit and foie gras parfait followed by a leg of venison steak chop whatever with a rossini sauce. I'm not going to rant on about either. 

I lie. The parfait was creamy as heck. But that was never apple jelly with it as the menu claimed. My napkin looked like Sweeney Todd's afterwards. I suspect a raspberry compote or A negative. But it was subtle, not gory. 

And the deer limb: it really looked like a tomahawk steak and claimed to be 18 ounces. But best of all, I was never asked how I wanted it. I approve. The chef should always decide how I want it. And how right he\/she was. The venison was between medium rare and medium rare. Never chewy, just the right amount of give. And not a whiff of gaminess which surprised me but did not disappoint. 

Back to the bacon, maple and apple action. It finished me off. Like a British pork pie of apples and cubes of meaty Canadian bacon (as we like to call it sour of the border) with a delightful dollop of maple ice cream on top. All I wanted was a private room where I could sink my face into it without all the judginess.

Good place to watch a game and drink but the service and food aren't so great. Went there on a weekday night during happy hour and had the mozzarella sticks which were a bit cold.

"The store is huge and has everything but wow the customer service needs some work.  I have had some rude run ins with the butcher department before and for some reason (probably because the store IS so big) I keep going back.  I think I am done now though.  I was looking to make a pre-order to pick up on Christmas Eve.  The unsmiling employee who seemed to be an assistant hesitated and then asked the main butcher ""Are we still doing pre-orders?"" He didn't even look up just barked ""NO MORE PRE-ORDERS!""  Now I know why she wasn't smiling.  If I had to work with that guy I would be sad too.  It has never been out of the norm at any grocery I ever went to in the past to get a pre-order for meat in 4 days before an event.  And, in fact, I called 2 other places and it was not a problem at all to get orders in so I have no clue what this guy's problem is but I do know I won't be having to deal with him in the future.

"This place is located on The Strip just outside of The Flamingo Hotel. They have their dogs in mainly two different categories: Retro Dogs and Haute Dogs (which are their signature hot dogs). I decided on my first visit to try one of the Retro Dogs called the Detroit Coney Classic. It wasn't bad, but nothing really stood out. The bun was soft, the hot dog cooked well, and the toppings were decent; nothing to hoot and holler about. The fries we got seemed to have either been sitting for a while under a heat lamp or were overcooked or both. We got water which they only sell bottled (but it does have their logo on the bottle which was cool). The pricing is what you would expect for being on The Strip but not too terribly overpriced for calling themselves a gourmet hot dog place.",0.0

"Went here with a friend last night for dinner. All I can say is the food is Amazing! Had the original stromboli with ranch and marinara on the side, pepperoni pizza, and zucchini chips. Everything was delicious! So much food and it was all around $35. We even had enough for left overs for the both of us. We sat in the dining area and bypassed the bar part of it. When I first walked in I wasnt so sure of the place. It looked like a small smokey bar. Once we went thru the dining area and saw families and others packed sitting enjoying their meals I was like ok they're busy. What brought me here though was the fact that its down the street around the corner for my house and my friend mentioned Guy Fieri recommended it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives so of course being a foodie I had to check it out.

Then she saw us and got an attitude about how they close in half hour. Our food came our cold and tasted  like crap. My shrimp was cold. We both got sick the next day. Karma pays back in folds because after us many people came in. My best thought on a food establishment is how they act when it's getting close to closing time. And you guys failed miserably.

"Excellent!!!! Best in town. Around 10 coin pool tables and 7 excellent full size league pool tables!! They also have darts, arcade, and tons of TVs at all different places around the bar for sports. This place is part pool hall \/ part sports bar \/ part restaurant \/ part cocktail bar \/ part cozy hideaway \/ part social club. It's lots of things all at once. One area of fun will be somewhat separated from the other areas so that if you're into doing one certain thing you won't feel bugged by people doing something else. Other bars and pubs and halls should learn from this place!! Event nights are creative. The music sounds great too, not to high on treble or bass and just loud enough. You can choose your own songs too and no one messes with it. It is not cash only as some shady reviewers say. The cocktail waitresses are so so at punctuality but very sweet. The crowd is very diverse here too and that makes everything a lot more comfy since all types are welcome. If your tired of cramped, dirty places with bar food and no where cozy to sit, badly kept pool tables, loud annoying sounding music, the same cowboy type crowd or people who are very clique, and having to go 4 different places in one night to do the things you want (in perhaps 2 different towns or more) then you'll love this place. 5 STARS.",0.0

I had the grilled chicken and shrimp with rice and a baked potato.  I was very impressed.  The shrimp were nicely cooked while the chicken was very tender.  The rice had lots of flavor and was very pleasing to the pallet.  The baked potato was a bit small in my opinion but still very good, and loaded with butter.  The other entrees  at our table were the fishermans feast which had a nice assorment of various seafood items, the lobster linguini, and their peppercorn steak.

"My husband and I moved into a new home and wanted a quick lesson on our new pool equipment. We saw the great reviews of Bee Clean Pools and decided to sign up for ""pool school"", which is an a 3-4 hour class at your home on how to properly maintain your chemicals. The owner states you get free text support for the following two years to help balance your chemicals each week. The class was informative, and we learned some new things about taking care of our pool. Throughout the class, the owner was extremely cocky, stating he won the ""Pool man of the Year"" award, but at the same time, we felt he was always holding back a little information in order to keep us as a customer. At the end of the class, the owner compiled a list of everything we need to ""properly maintain"" our pool. HOLY CRAP - if we agreed, the bill would have been over $500 (which included pool school)!!!!!! He did state that a few things we could probably find cheaper at B & L Pool Supply, but he made up for that because he delivers. We told him we needed to think about it, and went to check out B & L. Well ,we found everything on the list for under $150 at B & L Pools. When we told the owner, I think he was surprised that we comparison shopped, and said a sly comment like, ""Well, I guess I won't be telling other customers about B & L"". We initially texted him our chemicals each week, to help balance the pool, but once we got the hang out of it, we didn't feel like we needed to text him for advice all the time. Recently, we have attempted to occasionally text for advice, but twice we haven't heard back from him. Apparently, if you don't text often enough for support, you don't get the two years of support. Overall, he was informative, but I think there is a cheaper pool school out there (we paid $150). Plus, we just got that used car salesman vibe every time we interacted with him...he always seemed to be trying to sell us something.",0.0

"How do I start?  Let's start with a quotation or two.  One that comes to mind is ""it takes an eternity to get a customer but only 2 seconds to lose one"". This is exactly what happened at 7:10 pm on Jan 27.  Marvic and the cook took the liberty to yell at the top of those lungs that they do not honor typical Popeyes coupons that are advertised as specials. I remind you - this is on their website and coupons that state this it is valid only at this location. I at least give Marvic credit for ""checking up"" on possible acceptance but the cool came running out in his green apron to yell with confidence that ""we don't accept those coupons - I don't care what the website says"". I asked him if he even knew what they website said and he said yes. Yet he could not reiterate word by word but his hubris won't even let him look. Very bad service. And it's like my second grade teacher who once said "" it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for the rest of the bunch"". Well, Marvic, I will not only boycott your location but all popeyes locations. I cater a lot and now the other franchisees lost out.

The Zonkey Fries (carne asada fries) were good but the tacos were pretty bad borderline awful. The in house made tortillas were the main reason for the tacos being so bad.

"We were very fortunate to have been referred to Eddie by another plumber who wasn't available when I called. We had a rented auger stuck in our backyard sewer clean out pipe and we were on the clock for higher rental charges since my husband couldn't get it to come out after exhausting himself trying. Eddie arrived in a couple of hours to 'save the day'. To  be  honest, the situation seemed pretty hopeless, but Eddie was sure that he could retrieve the stuck cable and head. Sure enough, after wrestling with the exposed cable like an alligator wrangler, the stuck cable did come to the surface. In our case, however, it was kind of good news-bad news. The cable was able to be released, but that's because the cable actually snapped somewhere along the line which left the stuck auger head and some cable tail still in the sewer line...at least we were able to return the machine. What happens next remains to be seen. Eddie and his wife were a pleasure to work with and we would call them again if we need any other plumbing or drain issues resolved.",0.0

This place used to be so lovely with the friendliest and most accommodating office people. However, it got sold and the place went downhill. They spent lots of money on re painting the buildings this awful, dark colors. Black and gray in the desert, really??? Dark charcoal walls???? Who's idea was that??? Probably the new owners wanted to show they do somethings new for the residents. How about putting your money into replacing old, more than basic appliances??
The  grounds cleanup and maintenance became less of a priority and the hallways haven't been cleaned in weeks.

"Food:  3 stars
Ambience: 1 star
Service: 1.5 stars

Our search for a decent pasta in Scarborough brought us to Scaddabush on a hot Saturday evening.  As we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by at least 3 staff that were crammed in the narrow doorway.  

The restaurant itself had a very confused (eclectic, if you want to be nice) decor which translated into many other aspects which I'll get into later on.  We were seated in a bar section in a booth that was just a little too tight to comfortably get in and out of and the rail at the bottom of the banquet seating definitely would have posed a hazard to someone wearing high heels and not paying attention.  You could see the remnants of Jack Astor days very evidently here with rows of TVs facing our table. 

Since we had already read the reviews\/menu, we ordered our appetizers first and browsed the menu for the mains.  As we waited, it was already uncomfortably warm in the restaurant.  When asked, the server replied that the A\/C was on full and that she felt the heat more as she was moving around.  A curious response, indeed.  

Our server promptly returned with our bottle of wine and 2 visibly dirty wine glasses that I had to point out for her to bring new ones.  Our appetizer arrived and I was shocked to see the size of their signature meatball (just about 5 cm in diameter).  Sure, it was larger than most meatballs you encounter but at $13 a pop, I thought there would be more to it.  The meatball itself was flavourful but on a salty side and I'm pretty sure I won't order it again at $13 per meatball.  The bomba burrata was a much better dish with the creamy burrata swimming in a generously chillied tomato sauce.  The accompanying bread wedges were too oily for my liking and it was annoying to have to wipe my hands every time I reached for my glass of wine in between sampling the burrata.  

We had decided on the fettucine capri and a sirloin for our mains and funny enough, a doe-eyed waitress came by with a peppermill and some cheese before the mains even came out and asked us if we wanted some.  Uh...no...there is no food on our table, don't you see that???  

Fettunice capri came was generous in portion and I was happy to see that they were using fresh pasta.  The accompanying tomato sauce was also good and kudos to the kitchen for not over-cooking the seafood.  The gremolata that came atop the past was a little too coarsely chopped but it was fine.  But the real sour point was the lack of attention paid to the pasta noodles itself as there were too many parts of the pasta that were stuck together in a chewy clump.  My husband's sirloin was flavourless and cold as if it had sat in the kitchen while my pasta was being made.  Cold steak is not a yummy steak.  

Food aside, Scaddabush really needs to decide what kind of establishment they want to be as there was music blaring way too loudly the whole time we were dining.  It was hard to have a conversation without leaning across the table.  As we were leaving the restaurant, I saw a DJ standing next to the front of the house as people were seated uncomfortably in a row of chairs waiting for a table.  

Overall, Scaddabush experience was just that; ""a little bit of everything.""  Food wasn't bad albeit some execution issues.  The service and the ambiance is where they really felt short and if I wanted to drop $140 for a pasta dinner, it'll be elsewhere for sure.",0.0

"The ambiance and look of the place is very nice, clean open space. Ordered the Tallarin Verde, Bistec a la pobre, an order of yuca bread, and a cup of Chicha which is an ethnic Peruvian Drink. So lets begin with the Tallarin Verde, the flavor was good, but the type of pasta used was not my favorite and a bit on the soggy side, they add chicken to it but, I do not like meat. The Bistec a la Pobre looked decent, but the taste tester (yeah, im so fancy, I have taste testers) Subject stated the Bistec or the steak was not good, actually on the hard to chew side and lacking in flavor. The rice was not very nice on the palate, either. The only good things were the french fries and the fried plantains. Moving on to the Yuca bread, that is the reason why I might come back to this place, only for the Yuca bread, hmmm nummy! Hey you got something right! The Chicha was pretty good, but come on, if you can't make Chicha, then there is no way you are a true Peruvian Restaurant.",0.0

"I went in today for the first time and had an appointment with Michelle. She was INCREDIBLE. About thirty minutes into my hair coloring, I suddenly became so sick. I had a medical procedure yesterday and was having a reaction, and began shaking and doubling over from my abdominal pain. Michelle was so kind, she immediately offered to wash the color out, and had me call someone to pick me up. No one lives near Scottsdale, so it was over thirty minutes before my dad came to get me, and she sat with me the whole time and got me water and helped calm me down. She even offered to drive me home if I lived closer, and kept encouraging me to go to the emergency room next door. What a sweetheart. I felt so bad, this was our first time meeting and I was so out of it. She ended up not charging me at all, even though she spent an hour and a half doing my hair and sitting with me, and the original appointment was  hours that she missed out on. I will be tipping her so much extra next time, to make up for it! Haha. She was so great, and obviously very skilled. I love this salon, and I love Michelle!!",0.0

"Being a native New Yorker, new to the south, I've been searching for a farm-to-table restaurant that'd fulfill my expectations. This place is it! It's a bit of a drive, and I'd recommend reservations as seating is very limited, but do make the trip! My husband and I started with a delicious salad with warm goat cheese and strawberries marinated in a balsamic vinaigrette - as well as the tempura veggies. For the main course, we chose the chicken (breaded and cooked perfectly) and the strip steak. Both were absolutely delicious. At the end, neither of us had room for dessert - but with a meal like that we couldn't say no... just had to try what else they had in store.  The desserts were a great end to a fantastic meal.

The fries also are big and they use fresh potatoes that have been cut and fried. It is not crowded or too busy so the wait does not take long.

"This is an excellent place to try out on Lothian Road. I had meaning to come for a while, and reading some excellent reviews spurred me to finally give it a go. The place is very popular, and finding a seat can be difficult, although there are quite a few. There's a nice mix of stools and high tables, sofas, and armchairs, so you can choose a comfort level to suit you.

I was in with a few friends, and after settling down, we obviously went to get some beer. And the beer choice is tremendous. It changes regularly, and I mean regularly. I got a beer, and enjoyed it so much I went back to get it again 30 minutes later, only to find it was no longer on tap! No worries though, the selection is large enough to find an alternative without difficulty.

The beers are expensive though. Average price is about £3-£3.50 for 2\/3 pint (strange portion size), so it's definitely above average even for this city. The only other negative is that the music is too loud, so maintaining conversation is difficult unless you're very close to the other person.

"These fresh corn tortillas made in house are not to be missed. 

Current favourites:

Tinga de Pollo - sauce is lovely, chicken is prepared well, it's hearty enough to be a comforting, satisfying taco
Pescado - the fish is fried perfectly, balanced well with the crunchy cabbage - heat level of the spice is satisfying.  
Chorizo - good lord, the crisp cheese on this is like crack. Probably not the healthiest option but you won't regret its explosion of deliciousness.

The service was lovely: informed, attentive but not intrusive. If you prefer mild food I would bring that up with your server when ordering.     

The incongruous pricing on the menu throws me off. Tacos are tasty and being a bit larger than Grand Electric's they are reasonably priced. 
The Sangria tasted like it had a dose of grenadine in it or some sort of fruit concentrate. Not a bad thing necessarily, just not expected. It was not a $9 glass of Sangria.
The Margarita was prepared with fresh lime juice, had a nice salt rim and was mixed well but was FAR too small for the $9 price tag. 

A good location and the place has a warm, welcoming vibe. But the drink prices do not match the ambience.

"Not typical of an Argentinean restaurant but man was it some of the best meat I've eaten. 
I had the rosemary braised beef Sammy and it was to die for. 
They have chimichurri  sauce and 3 others you can choose to add to your food. They were a grilled onion sauce, a red pepper and tomato sauce and a garlic sauce. The only one I didn't use was the pepper\/tomato sauce. The other three were an excellent addition. I also tried the vegi empanada which I wasn't fond of but I'm an empanada snob so my expectations are high especially when you use the word empanada which shouldn't have been used here. It was more like a vegi turnover but if they called it that I would have never ordered it.

I will not say the name of the place but there is another Chinese buffet on Rainbow, a few blocks from Krazy buffet and it is ten times better.

"We had fun, and there's a lot to do and see. However most of the exhibits have some broken parts, and several exhibits were completely broken. Additionally we went at around 1100- and the place was overrun by ""Lifetime Fitness Summer Camp"" and crap like that. I completely get that it's not reasonable to expect a 22 year old gym rat to actually supervise 25 6-9 year olds, but that makes for a rotten trip for everyone else. My 3 year old was actually PUSHED by another kid who kept following us exhibit to exhibit and trying to shove my boy out of the way. At this point I want to grab the brat and shove him out of the way but that's how the cops get called. In short, we had fun, it's a little broken down, and if you go, make sure you arrive after 2 PM.

We went home to eat and about 1\/4 of the way through his food, he found a hair. He immediately threw his food away and we called to inform them. We aren't the kind of people that call to get free shit. We just want to let whoever is in charge know that they need to keep an eye on their chef. She started trying to almost defend it?

We went back because everyone deserves second chances. We had gone there 2 more times. Then 2 days ago he went and good food, and behold, another hair.

"This place is owed by the same people as Perch, so I'm told. Stopped in for a drink with a friend for Happy Hour. We tried the meatballs and had a couple beers. Meatballs were fantastic... They did a great job on them. Beer was fine... The copper color bar itself looked really nice and is a cool reference to the Copper State... They definitely need to donsome fine tuning... hopefully they will get everything else on the same level as the food.",0.0
"This place is one of the best in Markham to have laksa with the right amount of spicy kick ( very hot hot ) and in that plastic bowl that it comes in, it is surprisingly very hot and stays warm until the end. I love the soup because it's full of good flavors and the tofu squares totally soak up all that nice soup flavor. The noodles are great too because not too soggy. They often give alot and I usually can't finish it to the end, although I really try hard because it tastes so good. 

Price point is good because it is also located in the food court of fmp. It is tucked away in the corner and usually there is not a long wait for the food!!

"Went to this place last week with my wife, baby & mother in law for dinner. A couple of days later my baby started throwing up before bedtime & was sick for 3 days. I got sick right about the time she was getting better now my mother in law is sick too & my wife is starting to feel it. Instead of a nice meal from this horrible place. We went home with a doggybag full of the Norovirus. As most of the other reviews stated. The place is a filthy mess. Most of the supposedly clean plates & silverware still have food residue on them from the previous customer. I had to go through a stack before I could find a clean one. So if you want your whole family to get sick then this is your place. The health department should shut them down.",0.0

LOVE THIS PLACE! Somehow I've been working a block up from this place and never knew about it until a quick Yelp search yesterday turned it up. So thankful I went because the pizza was great! I'm from the North so I definitely have high standards for pizza and while of course nothing compares to NY pizza this is the closest I've gotten while in the South. I got the lunch special of 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $5.95. This did seem a bit pricey for slices so that is the only reason I can't commit to 5 stars but otherwise this is definitely a place I would recommend!,0.0
"We found this place thru a Yelp deal. The place looked like it had just opened because it was c-l-e-a-n. The owner was super friendly and enthusiastic, and our order came out quickly. 

We had a bowl, a wrap, and a sandwich plus 3 of the healthy bottle drinks (which were really, really good). Some positives and negatives about the food though. 

The smoked salmon bowl was different but in a good way. I'd recommend this. The smoked salmon wrap was ok, but not as good as the bowl. The roast beef sandwich though was very underwhelming.

It was a very basic sandwich like something you'd make at home if you didn't have a lot of time. For home that's fine, but at a restaurant it's disappointing. Maybe because my parents owned a deli for over ten years and I used to work in the kitchen during the summers, I expect a lot from a sandwich. Their sandwich for me was a 1-star.

There were however a couple of budding pop stars there taking up the mic on the little stage. The day we went was kids stage day and they're was a family with a couple little kids who were belting out tune after tune which provided for some smiles and cheers. That was nice. I believe local amateurs also perform there on certain days and times. 

Overall, there was a vagueness to the theme and menu of this place and the food we ordered reflected that. I don't think the owner is a real, hardcore foodie or a I-sleep-with-my-chefs-knife kind of cook. The place seems like it was started out of an idea to combine live music with some simple food. 

I hope it gets grounded, comes up with some really good food, a solid focus and succeeds. I'd watch a bunch a Diners, Drive Ins & Dives episodes, pick out a selection of the best, most doable, test them out and try to create a short menu of homeruns. Nobody cares where you got the recipe and you don't have to tell anyone. It just needs to be good and cheap. Word spreads fast when you can knock em out of the park every time.",0.0
"Broadstone is the BEST apartment community in the area. After living in several apartments in Tempe during college and doing an extensive search before making a decision on the next move, truly nothing compares to Broadstone Waterfront. The staff is SO attentive and responds quickly to all emails and needs. The amenities available are incredibly well-kept. For such a large complex, the pool, parlor and parking garage and gym never feel overly crowded. I was worried about noise, being on the bottom floor near a busy road... We never hear anything. Supposedly the neighbors dog barks a lot and we never hear him either! Units are nice and big, appliances are all great too. My fiancé and I both absolutely love every aspect of Broadstone and have no intention on moving any time soon!",0.0

"The owner or worker definitely assumed the sale and tried to push the dozen donut holes for 99 cents on me too.

Nothing special about these donuts when you're used to California o nuts and cronuts. I'd have to say I was a bit disappointed with the quality but the only saving grace were the blueberry donuts.
Great flavor. Moist and yummy.
The sour cream and old fashioned were just blah.

This location has great parking and is next to gigis cupcakes. We actually were going to get cupcakes but they were closed so settled for donuts.

"Thursday May 19 2016 6PM checked in at kiosk
TL;DR
Wait: about 45 minutes keep in mind our time frame though.
Lines at food stations: seafood was longest at like 8 people others had 1 or 2.
Price: $60 without tip add unlimited beer wine champagne for $20
Service: they did there job well for a busy place
Seafood: mediocre
American: meats were great, sides were good but simple
Mexican: meh IMO
Italian: looked good but I wanted to save space for more adventurous food.
Asian: awesome selection, some OK, some amazing.
Desserts: good, just wish I wasn't so full by the time I tried it lol.

Let me start by saying my company paid for this meal so I will not be heavily weighing the value of the food for the price paid. Also we came for dinner and with $10 tip it came to $70 for anyone wondering. If you wanted to add unlimited drinks it was an extra $18 (which I don't consider bad at all but my friend and I were still a little hungover from the night before)

When you go to wait you first check-in at a kiosk. Ours said 60-71 minute wait but we weren't in a hurry so we walked around and checked the gambling tables and the shops at the forums. They texted us probably 15 minutes later to tell us to come back. You go back and then you really wait in line, for us it was about 30 minutes in line. So overall 45 minute wait, and this was started at 6pm on a Thursday in the middle of may.

The service was good for how busy they were, drinks were always filled and finished plates were taken. 

The food here is very diverse and there are A LOT of options so pace yourself if you want to try everything. The seafood was OK but pretty basic. The crab legs were not Alaskan king crab legs but just the regular ones. I will note that I saw a table that had king crab legs but they were ""VIP"" so I guess higher retired guests get a better experience, but hey they did pay for it. Other than that the seafood was mediocre for a ""high end"" buffet. Shrimp, clams, scallops, oysters, different fish prepared different ways, nothing amazing though.

Next I tried the meats\/Americans section which was very good. The prime rib was very good and the au jus worked well with its. The lamb and sausage were also very good, along with the pulled pork. Fried chicken and fries were good but nothing special. There was also your plain old mashed potatoes and gravy,  Mac and cheese, and veggies but I was saving as much room for more interesting food as possible.

The Mexican section was nothing to rave about, the street tacos were OK and nothing else really looked good (to me that is).

Next was the Italian section where I ate nothing. This is just because I didn't want to waste space on bread and pasta, etc. Also there's only so much that can be done with Italian food and I've tried my fair share.

And then we have Asia, my favorite cuisine. The selection was amazing the only thing I was missing was some Korean BBQ. They had tonkotsu ramen which was OK, very salty and the flavors were OK. The pho was good for a buffet too. The did have crispy duck through and I splurged on that! Probably about half a duck cooked perfectly. The sushi was good for a buffet, better than the buffet sushi back home. There were some good octopus dishes too. Then there was dumplings and egg roles fried rice and noodles, udon soup as well. They tried to focus on real Asian food and not as much americanized Asian from what I could tell and I loved it.

Lastly deserts were very good but didn't have much room to fully enjoy them lol. They were doing crepes to order so I got a Nutella crepe with banana topping and whip creme, which was amazing. They had ice cream and gelato but was too full to try that after tarimisu, creme brule, flan, and coffee cake. There were also some cake pops and plain looking cookies.

Overall it was a great experience, I would probably go back if I had not eaten all day and was celebrating something special.",0.0

"This place is wonderful. Ms. Kelly, Ms. Rachel, Julie up front... they are all wonderful. My daughter has been taking ballet here for about 4 months now and I can't compliment them enough. I simply don't see the perceived rudeness of the other reviewers. This is a place for dance education and fun. About tardiness, yes the children need to be on time. They need to warm up, they need to not interrupt those who are learning and who are on time. About dropping classes and paying for unfulfilled obligations, this is a small business. They have these policies in place so they can keep the lights on and feed their families. If your child wants to learn to dance and not dink around and goof off, then these are the skilled instructors you want teaching. If you child just wants to wear the outfit and pretend to be a ballerina and dink around not paying attention, this might not be the place.",0.0

He was very patient and listened to everything I needed and worked quickly, but step by step, and showed me how it looked at each stage, giving me tips along the way for hair maintenance. And I'm grateful he did that, because while he was working on my hair, I decided to go with his suggestion as it was even better than what I had in mind!!

"Solid all around. Might be one of the closest places you'll go to get an authentic NY slice of pizza. For $6 you can get 2 pieces of pizza and a drink. That's a solid deal for Vegas.

"I've never had anything better than mediocre customer service in Cara's.  Usually the sales clerks struggle to even greet those walking into the store.  My most recent experience involved a rude clerk with awful people\/sales skills who insulted my idea of a gift and also suggested I get a water bottle instead of spend money on a piece of jewelry. Nice- I'm sure your sales lead will be pleased to read that.  I walked out immediately and took my business to Nordstrom Rack and got a beautiful pair of Kate spade earrings and an Alex & ani bracelet for a much better price.

The meat was flavorful and well seasoned, the Mexican slaw and fresh pico was also a nice touch. It was garnished with farmers cheese and some cilantro and it was delicious.

Hubby got chicken and waffles.  The onions and sage and thyme all combines with the waffles and syrup and it was interesting and good.  The fried chicken was good too.

"We went to the Compass Arizona Grill for Thanksgiving. No complaints about the wait staff but then it was a buffet, how bad could it be. The restaurant charges a hefty fee for eating TG with them our tab was $ 190 WITHOUT liquor. ( for two ) The food was good but not ,memorable. Since the restaurant is upping the ante on price and food it seems like everything should be kicked up a notch. The waitstaff looked good in black shirts and pants but the host staff looked just above picnic attire. The view is stellar",0.0

"I don't know why this place is packed all the time (had to wait a long time for a seat), probably due to location, because the food is really nothing special. First of all they have a limited bar, and you couldn't really order really just any drink you want, which is not really a problem. The Martini was pretty good. The foie gras was fine, but the bread was very stiff and hard to swallow. The salad was just a lot of mayo splattered all over some lentils - was actually really bad.,There are 3\/6 entrees that are cold dishes, so we both settled for the braised lamb. It is not well done at all - lukewarm, lacking flavor and was not even that tender. For a Yorkville restaurant it is really uninspiring.",0.0

On the up side the vanilla latte was delicious and their scones were great! I just wish the service was friendlier  I went again trying to give it a second chance, but that time it was an older woman and she was distant as well and was having a conversation with another customer the whole time I was trying to order, it was a bit awkward and uncomfortable so I once again just walked home to eat instead of staying there.",0.0

There is a sign posted about helping speed up the line, to be ready when we make it up to the window.  There had to have been maybe 5 cars in front of us, it took 10 minutes to get up to the window, at which point one employee was sweeping the floors, one girl looked like she was trying to make drinks, and the girl that should have acknowledged us, taken our money and gave us our drink had her back to us for a few minutes talking to the other employees.

"One of the newest attractions in Las Vegas, High Roller was one of the recommended sites to see. We were wandering around The Strip after Midnight and ended up walking to it to see it. We bought tickets at the ticket booth before getting on the ride. It was around 36 dollars to just rider it per person but we opted for the Happy Hour option which includes 30 minutes of open bar. 

There was no line to get on to the ride, but we did have to wait a couple cars to pass by since the Open Bar ones only come every once in while. The Observation Car is fairly roomy with a makeshift bar in the middle. The bar provided for the usual basic cocktails, champagne and beer.

"The worst hotel experience that I have ever had!! I had reserved a room here for a weekend during spring training with my boyfriend and friend. When we first arrived we just dropped off our bags and left, not really looking around at the features the room had to offer. Later that night we came back to call it a night when my boyfriend called me from the bathroom to come see what he found. He had smashed a bedbug that was pretty big which was far from comforting. After this experience we looked on the floors and bed and saw at least 4 bugs running across the room and sheets. If that wasn't exciting we noticed cockroaches, beetles, and god knows what else crawling down through the walls and bathroom. Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts. They offered to move us to a different room but at that point we wanted nothing to do with the room.  The one positive of this whole experience was the lady who helped us out at the front desk. Extremely nice and apologetic. I wish I remembered her name. If you've ever seen the movie "" The Birds"", it can compare to the experience that my friends and I shared at this Motel 6.",0.0

"I really wanted to like this hotel, but I didn't get a single night of good sleep here. The beds are comfortable and the shades are dark, two great pluses. However, the A\/C units were poor in a number of rooms our group stayed in and took days to cool down the rooms. The location was good, short walking distance to city center, and it wasn't too much work to get there. We took the Pearson Express train to the train station, then the subway to the closest stop, then still had a few blocks to walk. The elevator in this building is horrifying. I swear it took 5 solid minutes for it to get to the 4th floor where my room was. The downsides were the noise. Poor insulation inside, so you could hear every door opening and closing on your floor. I got woken up each day at 4-4:30 with birds sitting on the ledge outside my window and tapping on the window\/cooing\/etc. You could scare them away, but they just came back, time and time again.

We are not fans of the ""Sysco"" restaurants in our neighborhood, so I'm always telling my husband we have to drive out of our hood to try better places. BLD was pretty much a Sysco place, nothing priority about it. We went here because we saw it on Check Please Arizona, and the reviews and pictures here. We ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon. They literally put about a teaspoon of hollandaise sauce on each egg, unlike the photos I saw here. I ordered the biscuit and gravy, there hardly wasn't any gravy, the eggs literally covered up the gravy, I thought maybe they just forgot it. In the gravy was hardly but 2 or 3 little bitty chunks of what they called sausage. I singled out a piece and could swear it tasted like hamburger not sausage, my husband agreed. Nothing like the photos I saw here with gravy run amok. In all honesty this place rates right up there with IHOP or VI, closer to my house, less expensive and taste about the same. So the B part of BLD, I won't be back. Maybe I will try the L&D part, someday?",0.0

"What a great little place! Solid Cantonese food served up by some people that hustle. The service is a bit haphazard but competent. This is a typical family Chinese place.  Formica tables, linoleum floors and a bit ""sweaty"".  The food is the star of the show and is well done.  We tried the salt n pepper pork, Chinese vegetables with garlic sauce, and braised tofu.   All three were well prepared and served hot.  In typical cheese fashion, each dish was delivered as the kitchen finished making it.   

As stated earlier, it makes the service chaotic but your food is hot!   We were there two hours and I was the only non-Asian patron in the place.  Always a good sign from my experience!  Highly recommend this place if you want Cantonese fair.  Two thumbs up from us!",0.0
"I was craving breakfast and was finished my work on campus nearby so I thought I would try Cora's for takeout.
 
Ambience: As soon as I walked in there was no one at the front to greet me. It was just an empty restaurant front while everything else was happening towards the back of the place. I had to walk in and look for a server to help me.

Food: I was ordering breakfast for my sister and myself. I ordered the Mountain of Strawberries Waffles for myself and the Delicious Cherries pancakes, sausage and a side of syrup for my sister. We both enjoyed our breakfast!

Service: The server who was helping me gave me the menu and pointed out exactly what I wanted. I asked for my receipt and noticed that she charged me for something I didn't order.. Instead of putting in an order for the Cherry pancakes, she charged me for the Blueberry Fields. I let her know, she apologized and she went to go change the order with the kitchen. My food arrived and as she handed me the bags, she mentioned how the Cherry pancakes cost $1.75 more but how she waived it because it was her mistake with the mix-up.. (Okay.. you screwed up, why are you letting me know that it was more expensive, even though it was your mistake?)

Price: I paid almost $30 for both meals.. which is not very student friendly in terms of prices.

"Wednesday night is wing night.   I rated a four based on the wings and salad bar.  The wings looked to be fried then run through the grill (I think).  They were cooked perfectly.  The wings are larger than your average wings you get at a sports bar.   They are crispy and tender, I cannot say enough about these wings.  100% totally surprising me, as I am a wing snob.  The sauce is on the side, so I went with traditional buffalo.  They have other choices....

The salad bar had a great variety.  Looked fresh, actually looked better than some nasty Golden  Corrals I have been too......  The chicken noodle soup looked homemade, but I couldn't swear to it.  The noodle are wide, it was tasty.  

So, Village Inn Pizza - that name.......... Pizza?   It is a solid 3 star.  Nothing special, a little below average.   It is ALL thin crust, so if you like hand tossed or traditional, you are out of luck.  

It is worth mentioning the buffet was kept extremely clean, the place was full, which ensured a great turn over of food, but sometimes with a full crowd ---  the feeding frenzy leaves crap all over the bar.  The staff is friendly and works hard.   The bathrooms are clean.   

To sum it up, for $9.99, you cannot go wrong, do not expect NY pizza, but you get your belly full.  Furthermore, CiCi's has better pizza for cheaper, but there isn't any remotely close.  (Exit 23 closed :-()",0.0

"I had never been to this place before and am new to the area. I hadn't had pizza since since going vegan about 8 months ago and had a craving for pizza that I finally broke down and gave into (not the meat though, just the cheese. Dogs get the meat).
They didn't have delivery but were close to my home, so I decided to give them a shot. I called and ordered a large deep dish pepperoni pizza. The girl said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I said ""wow! Ten minutes? That's fast!""
So I get there about 15 minutes later, just in case they're busy and need a few extra minutes. I walk in and the place is empty. I see people working in the back so I stand and wait. The girl finally sees me and I tell her my name and what I had ordered for take-out. She says, ""It's going to be about 10 minutes. She forgot to throw it in the oven.""

REALLY????

But she offers me a free bottle of soda, so I wait. 
While I'm standing there I see that they have a drive through window. Cool.
I also notice that their specialty is to-go pizzas, and they are making them in mass! They're stacked up in mega piles in the cooking area! And the to-go pizzas (aka ""Hot n Ready"") are only $5 each. My large deep dish and two small garlic butter sauces was about $10, and I ended up waiting about 30 minutes to get it.

I must say, the place was clean, and the girl made things right by offering the free bottle of soda.

When I finally got to eat some of my pizza it was pretty good. The crust was really thick (probably too thick) and there was an adequate amount of sauce and cheese but the sauce was a bit acidic\/tangy, and they scrimped on the pepperoni. My dogs would have liked more pepperoni.

All in all it wasn't bad for the price. But I wouldn't recommend the buttery garlic dipping sauce. Too strong and gave me heartburn for the next couple days! Icky.

"The Original"" was the first dish EVER that made me want to make special trips to any food place as often as i could.  That was over 20 years ago and to either of the original 2 spots in Los Angeles.  I was heart broken when they closed and beyond happy when it reopened.  However, no matter what they say,  the recipe is not the same.  It's been tweaked and not necessarily for the better.  Now is good enough for me to remember how good it used to be but not good enough, hence only 4 stars. The Original is a bowl of tasty, somewhat spicy broth you eat by dunking slices of French bread. A the broth level goes down,  a pound of shrimp is slowly revealed.  The Original coves with shell on shrimp.  There is an option to have it with the shuttle previously shelled, as well as having either rice or pasta adeed into the broth as well. I only recommend The Original,  but mostly because it's an experience too peel the shrimp with your fingers. Wash your hands twice,  use the bibb,  ask for extra napkins and get to pinching tails and...well,  you know how is said shrimp are best eaten. The clam chowder is good to,  but i can't vouch for any of the other dishes on the menu.  I'd like to have them some day but that will never happen because for me,  there's only 1 reason to come here. The Original.",0.0

The location is a little tricky to find as it's upstairs in the little building as opposed to having a storefront on street level. 
My group did the Vegas room, and although 2-6 ppl are recommended, we did it with 3 and it was great. The room set-up was pretty cool, not cheapo or disappointing. We had to figure out a vault code to 'steal billions' while there was a 'fire and evac of the casino'. 
There were quite a few steps to this room (it was their hardest one of the 4 they have, with a 12% success rate or something along those lines), but we managed to get through to the very end with only a couple nudges in the right direction from the employee.

"Yummy place. Staff is still trying to figure it out. They weren't sure what white wine they had available. Love the cheese sauce on the fries. It's not the typical nacho cheese. Only down side is the hamburgers are pretty small for the price. I bought a glass of wine, fries, and a burger which all came to $23 . I'll be back for the cheese fries burger was average.",0.0

"Came here tonight for the first time since the remodel. Consciously didn't come here right after reopening, though it's so close to home, knowing there'd be kinks and it would be busy. Foolishly thought those would be ironed out by now. The seats were nice (though not as spacious as other theaters with comparable seating). The lines were horrible, unorganized, and super long. It wasn't clear where you needed to be when you walked in. Out of the soda machines, one was out of 90% of sodas, and one was out of ice. We took to having everyone in line for the soda machines getting ice from one and soda from the other. Our movie was in 3D, and it seemed nobody was aware or handing out glasses. Nobody in our theater had been handed glasses. I volunteered to go point this out to a worker, and had a hard time tracking one down. When I finally did track down two workers to aid us, one seemed understandably super flustered. I felt bad for her. But the other was downright rude..guess I'll bite the bullet and go to the slightly further theaters of the area in the future.. I was so excited for this remodel too.. :( I've been spoiled by going to the Cinemarks in the area recently. And somehow thought this would be able to compete.",0.0

"Went here on a Sunday night. The decor was pretty sweet, with a modern hipster-ish look. The place was pretty loud, but habitable. The waiter took a while to get us menus, but after that he was quick to get our orders. We tried the pork nachos. The portion was a bit larger than expected. Overall, it was really well made. The pork just melts in your mouth. I ordered the chicken sandwich. It came with avocados, tomato, and some aioli on the bread (which I think was ciabatta, but I could be wrong.). It came with a hefty serving of fries. Since I'm not legally allowed to drink, I can't give a great review of the bar. From what I've seen, however, the service is pretty good with some interesting cocktails. Overall, The Urban Tap is a fine place to stop for lunch or brunch, and I definitely hope to come back here.",0.0

"My fiance and I chose to have Union Pig & Chicken cater our wedding and both their product and service was fantastic. From the beginning, the management staff was informative, available, and interested in ensuring that we had enough food to serve our guests. Throughout the evening, family and friends routinely asked who our caterer was because everything had tasted so great. With all of the other issues we experienced that evening, in terms of the venue space and parking obstacles, it was such a relief to hear that the food aspect was running very smoothly. Their team of servers were professional, helpful, and very nice to interact with. They made our guests feel comfortable and worked to accommodate in a swift manner. Hats off to you, Matt, Mario, & Jade.

"Like a lot of reviewers I was drawn by Matty, or rather a friend's love for him. The bartenders and hostesses are so nice at P&L that it pains me to speak ill of the place, but I have to be honest: My meal was disappointing from start to finish. The red wine poured into my glass had turned - I asked for another and it was replaced by another that was also iffy. For my meal I had the broccolini, which was cooked to a nice char and topped off with a tasty egg, but all that goodness was soggy and overwhelmed by too much sauce underneath. The pasta was really disappointing - paper-thin ravioli that was again drowned in a watery sauce. (The mushrooms on top were fab though.)",0.0

Their bagels are excellent with great variety and the choice of cream cheese is awesome. Everything I have had here has been very fresh and tasty. We were so excited that they opened because Avon has NOTHING but chain restaurants as far as the eye can see. It's like the city has banned local bakery's or breakfast places-and it's not like Barry's is independent or local (again, I think the city must have something in their ordinances against that), but at least now we have some other option than Bob Evans or Perkins :( Their coffee situation is very limited, but we get our bagels to go and enjoy them at home on our patio with our own coffee.

This was the second time I have been.  The first time they were fairly new so I waited to see if they were just having beginners problems.  I absolutely love the concept of this place. The outdoors decor is fantastic and the staff personable. However the ice cream is so lacking in flavor.  My group of friends and I tried a couple to see if maybe it was just the one.. But sadly they are all flavorless. .. I know that it is homemade and not mass produced and that's exactly what appealed to me but all of the flavors were bland.,0.0

"There are so many places to get sushi in the Mandalay complex, I picked this one because I wanted to try the hot mess and pop rock in. I did try those along with the crispy rice and black cod miso. To start my friend has a beer and I had a $20 glass of grape plum sake which tasted like pure grape juice, I wouldn't get that again. The crispy rice came out and it was so good. The crispy rice texture with the tuna was great and the sauce they poured over it was yummy. The miso black cod I have seen in many menus and always hear how great it is, this I thought was ok, I just don't think it was my thing. The hot mess, one of the best sushi rolls I have ever had. The poke in too was so fresh I found myself wishing for just a big bowl of poke. The pop rocking was interesting I was skeptical, but the flavors paired so well together and it made for a mouth pleasing fish it balanced out the spice perfectly. Then there was dessert.....always my favorite part of the meal. First off they have an amazing desert menu and I wanted to get one of everything but I settled on the island summer which was a pineapple guava upside down cake with vanilla bean ice cream and a caramel run sauce. I barely ever finish dessert but this is one of the times it was gone, it was a very small serving though. As soon as you take your first bite the essence of guava explodes in your mouth, I love guava and when it was gone I found myself wanting more. Overall a great meal with good service and nice atmosphere and I will be back here when I want sushi and I'm in Vegas.",0.0

"This review is an update to a previous review I wrote back in 2015. This location of Bed Bath & Beyond has improved with their customer service. My husband was recently there to purchase a filter for our Keurig 3.0. We were greeted by a friendly and helpful gentleman as soon as we entered the store. This same gentleman helped us find what we were looking for where all of the Keurig coffee, makers and accessories are located. Throughout our time in the store, we encountered friendly employees asking us if they could assist us. At check-out we had a helpful employee who helped me with my 20% off coupons. She pointed out some were for one item only and another one I had was for 20% off the entire order. I am so glad she pointed this out to me as previously I have not paid attention to this. The store is neat, stocked and clean. Overall a good place to go for kitchen or house hold items. It is a fun store for me because I like to browse and see what is new in the way of kitchen appliances and gadgets. We had a very positive experience and we will return to this location.",0.0
"Came on a Friday lunch. My last visit was three years ago. 

Ordered:
1. Shirmp & Veggie tempura Udon 
This was the most saltiest udon broth I've ever had! To the point that after sipping just three spoons, I can feel my lips wrinkling and my throat drying!

Tempura was not crispy at all, probably the frying temperature was not high enough, resulting all the veggies were soggy and oily. Even an ayce sushi does better. 

The udon noodle itself was not chewy, it tasted like over cooked dumpling skin. So soggy that almost every time I've tried picking it up, the noodle just breaks off, which never happens to any other Udons i've had at other places. 

2. Sashimi lunch 

Just not fresh at all. Salmon quality is like the ones you get in Costco that have been left there for few days. 

Overall, I don't understand how the 4 stars came from. I'm not asking much, just expected for the price it should at least be a bit better then ayce sushi or maybe even those sushi chain restaurants.

"Escape Games is absolutely my favorite escape room place that I've tried. Granted, I haven't tried other highly rated places except for Casa Loma, but in a vacuum I will always give this company five stars. Being located near a subway station and right off the highway makes it very convenient to reach.

My friends and I have completed all the active missions (and a few retired and outdated ones) and they are all incredibly well made and thought out. Mayan Curse is the only mission that was pretty weak immersion-wise and even that one is still better than some of the more mediocre companies' rooms. Each mission is multiple rooms and Escape Games uses their 10,000 square feet very effectively.

Syndicate: The Relic Heist and The Unknown were both phenomenally well-done and are absolute must-trys. In Syndicate, the room gives you everything you'd expect from a heist mission and you really do fall into certain roles as your team works together. I was absolutely giddy at some of the things we had to do and I can't imagine how anyone wouldn't enjoy it. The Unknown really is unknown, so all I'll say is that it's designed for you to enjoy an experience more than it is to be challenging.

One of the greatest strengths of Escape Games is their use of technology, which unfortunately is also the source of my only complaint about this place. They still use basic key and combination locks, but they also use magnetic locks, computers, and other electrical triggers, which are very neat. It's little things like that that really set the good companies apart from the cheaper ones.

Now while I do enjoy these nice features, they have also been the cause of some technical difficulties. We've been stalled a few times due to faulty systems and one of our rooms ended before we finished the last couple of puzzles (causing them to reset parts of the room so we could finish). But even so, I still absolutely adore this place and I'm perfectly willing to accept that when you push the limits of status quo, things aren't always going to work properly.

The staff are all super nice and friendly. They've always been very helpful and love chatting about certain aspects of rooms after we finish them as much as we do. We've never taken more than seven people so we never had issues with locker space. They did install a set of lockers in the lobby somewhat recently so it looks like they are more flexible with storage space if you need it.

Lastly, I just love the design of the puzzles. They are all very logical and flow naturally. You never feel cheated or tricked and many puzzles are just very rewarding to piece together. They give you all the information, they never make you re-use something once you've used it to solve a puzzle, and there's no excessive ""find or read something in the dark"". The success rates range from 20% - 50%, so I imagine their one hint rule is pretty strict. All the missions are pretty linear except for Noriko, which allows bigger groups to do parts in parallel. I felt the time limit was always generous and only Syndicate was really tight for time. If you bring the minimum number of people to some of the harder rooms it will definitely be more of a challenge.

All in all, it's an amazing place staffed by amazing people who are constantly working to design new rooms with new puzzles to keep rolling out fun rooms for us to enjoy. I will not be back... until they finish Mindshaft because there is nothing left for me to do there. This was the first place I've been to, and after trying other places I've realized just how high they set the bar for me initially. I recommend Escape Games to anyone that I ever talk to when escape rooms come up and will always vouch for them.",0.0

"Hands down the best sandwich shop in Pittsburgh. Their sandwiches are incomparable. Every sandwich is like a gourmet meal wrapped up in a handheld package.  I've been going there consistently since it opened about three years ago and I've never had a bad sandwich.  The soups and sides are always good too.  And if you're looking for the ultimate hangover cure, you'll find it in the il Bastardo--carby, greasy, salty, fatty, eggy goodness. (It's also great when you're sober.)",0.0

"Not impressed, wasn't first visit. Ordered....well wanted to order the half roasted chicken and was told they are out of it and the bbq half chicken (on a Sunday at 6pm). OUT OF CHICKEN??? So proceeded to order the ""country fried chicken"" w\/ mashed & gravy. When the tables food came it looked great, big fried piece of chicken w\/gravy but upon eating it....let me just say ""COUNTRY"" fried you better believe it. That gravy is beyond country. You taste the whole damn farm. It tastes how cow poop smells, No other words to describe it.  I took one bite and about vomited on the table.  Sent it back and got a different replacement meal to go as the party I was there with was about done eating before to go meal came.  A manager then came to our table and asked if I still wanted the chicken, it was ""now available"" Why wasn't I told by my server that it was cooking and WILL be ready shortly?? I still would of just ordered that and waited.  Appetite was ruined after tasting the whole farm in one bite. In conclusion it wasn't our first trip, as my family likes their steak but that made it our last. I'm NOT impressed....the ONLY good thing on the menu\/served are the sweet yeast rolls n butter. Oh and by the way, don't expect HALF a chicken...a baby chicken or maybe a pigeon...but this is the smallest half chicken I've ever seen in my life.",0.0

"1st time here yesterday and though there were no one else in the restaurant, the food and service was above par. The restaurant is spacious and clean, and there's a good amount of selection on the menu. I ordered the ""house"" dog aka ""the dirt dog"" which consisted of a beef dog wrapped in bacon (all their dogs are which is awesome!) topped with grilled onions and peppers cooked in thousand island sauce, letchu, mayo, mustard, and bacon bits! As far as the bun, you have a choice of 3, I chose the Portuguese which is a ""sweeter"" bun and the bun is laced with a green chile spread. Overall, it was a delicious dog! Probably one of the best I've had in a while. My friend ordered the ""red"" dog which was spicier -- and for those who aren't too used to spice, it definitely has a kick! My lips were burning a bit after tasting hers! Dirt dog is definitely a good spot to grab a quick and satisfying bite, so glad they brought one over from LA to Las Vegas. Also, shoutout to one of the chef's Cameron! Since business was a little slow when I went, he hooked it up with some free samples that weren't on the menu!

"I had been experiencing extreme hip pain that shot down my left leg for about 6 weeks.  I tried chiropractic care and was finally advised to see a pain specialist.  The next morning I couldn't even walk and the pain was off the scale.  As I was on my way to the emergency room I decided to try the Core Institute to see if they could get me in for a same day appointment. The receptionist was very kind and offered an appointment an hour later.  Not knowing what to expect at the emergency room, I accepted the appointment.  After an hour wait, I saw Dr. Collins.  He asked me what was wrong, looked at my x-rays, twisted my foot to the left and then said ""nothing is broken and it is not your hip, I am a hip doctor and you need a back doctor"".  I was sitting in a wheel chair crying with pain. He never examined me more than moving my foot slightly.  I never even got out of the wheel chair.  In a matter of 5 minutes  he said ""well I guess we could order an MRI, if that's what you want but it will take about 7 days.""  What a waste of time!  Dr. Collins had to have been the most insensitive doctor I have ever seen!  He didn't even take the time to examine or ask if he could do anything to ease the pain.  I left crying and completely frustrated.  I went immediately to Mercy Gilbert Emergency Room they had me in a room with a nurse, doctor, IV and CAT scan within 30 minutes.  I would never recommend The Core Institute to anyone!  What a joke!",0.0

The fish tacos were great, best dish for the both of us.  The saffron rice was decent, nothing special.  The deep fried calamari was disappointing as the batter was not crispy enough and was falling off of the calamari.

"As vegetarians, it is funny to leave a review for a place named for its steaks.  However I can find non meat dishes anywhere. And though their non meat sides weren't great (especially  for the price)  the all over experience is worth every penny! Wait staff is constantly refilling glasses, brushing crumbs off table, aligning silverware......my kids thought it was hysterical! I let my son order the $80 seafood appatizer (he was 12) on a 3 tiered ice platter and even though that's rediculous -it was worth it-it was so beautiful, and a full meal for him! Their drinks are really good too.  I've been back to the bar just for their drinks.",0.0
"This is one of my favorite ramen shops in the Tempe area. The menu is very simple, especially with the ramen, but there's still room to try new things or customize your order. I have tried both the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen, while my boyfriend has tried their ultra spicy ramen. Their miso ramen has a lot more depth of flavor to it compared to their tonkotsu broth, and my boyfriend said that their ultra spicy is LEGIT (and this is the kind of person who can eat ghost peppers). Their braised pork belly is also an excellent addition to ramen, but I've yet to try it donburi style with rice. Extra toppings add up so just be mindful of that when ordering.",0.0

"Like most people I don't like going to the Dentist. I moved to Phoenix in 2005 and couldn't seem to find a good dentist. So I stopped going like a idiot. After a few years I knew I had to find a dentist, so the search began. I found Dr K and read all the positive reviews so I gave him a shot. I'm happy I did. I had a lot of work that needed to be done and he did a great job. He is very friendly and laid back. His staff is extremely friendly and outgoing. I know I have found my forever dentist as long as he is practicing. I have recommended him to friends and will continue to do so. One last thing, the office is extremely clean with a modern feel. TVs mounted above the chairs and they will let you watch whatever you want. Highly recommend Dr K and his staff.",0.0

While they don't sell any individually, they also do not sell ANY of the better known brands. They have a few multi-packs of the cheap brands (marked up) but that's all.

"I contacted Jeff to spend some time with an ASU student upon arrival in Tempe for another year at School. First, he is very nice and empathetic. We discussed hypnotherapy and re-wiring of thoughts before our session via telephone. He was very patient and what could it hurt?  Emotional trauma leaves scars and we were open to other forms of treatment. Often medically prescribed drugs have side affects and they don't offer new ways of thinking to develop coping skills. Counseling can be great if you find a counselor well trained for action and not just to provide a place to dump negative thought each session remaining victim in your own mind. It was pure wonder that Jeff could insight a physical feeling without touch instead with the snap of a finger. We worked through three major hurtful experiences, naming them, not explaining them. As the onlooker, those experiences I could see were extremely painful. As a parent, I was surprised by the experiences named. It just goes to show what one thinks is relevant to another can be way off! It took a lot for me to not go back to a particular item named and ask my child, ""what the heck was that? What happened 'here' that I don't know about?"". I thought I was completely in tune with my kid and knew pretty much everything as a committed parent. Through therapy Jeff diminished the pain of a past experience and my ""patient"" is asking for more. The relief felt was that good. We will hire him again. The patient has set goals and would like to reset the endings to events. It would be a blast to see his entertainment hypnosis some day. It's difficult to imagine such a thoughtful caring guy might also be funny the way hypnotists are on stage. We are grateful for Jeff and his hypnotherapy talent!",0.0

My friend ordered the Huevos Rancheros and although she thought they were a little small in portion for the price, she said they were really good. I ordered the Jackfruit Sliders, but vegan-style so they put it on one big focaccia instead. It came with fries and a unique cinnamon ketchup-type sauce. It was delicious and vey filling! My friend and I shared some of it. Cute little place and I will definitely be back to try the pastries that looked really unique and good. Only took away a star for the confusion in ordering, the time difference between when they brought my friends meal and mine, and the chai tea latte I got which was only okay.",0.0

The only issues we had was with the billing. It was not very busy when we were there but they gave us the wrong bill in the beginning, okkkkkkk that happens.
But when we went to pay they short changed us about $20 because the cashier gave us small bills in 5's and singles, but she recounted 2-3 times.
We got to the car and realized we were short so my bf went in and without hesitation she took a $20 that was part of another table payment and gave it to him. ( Things that make you want to go hmmmm) She did not retrace the transaction or question if he was sure she gave the wrong change.

I had an horrible experience at Carrabas On Tiedeman Rd! We had a party of 12. We waited for 30 minutes for a table despite the table at the bar being available the entire time. After we were seated it took 30 minutes just to put in a order for drinks. It took an hour before we were even able to put in our order for our meal. It took 2 hours before we received our meal. We were not given refills for our drinks. We had appetizers that were ordered and never arrived. After waiting 2 hours for the food, one of the kids orders never arrived. He had to wait an additional 20 minutes for his food. We were not offered fresh Parmesan for our pasta, when I requested it. It took Jared 10 minutes to bring some to the table. The pasta was luke warm and the sauce had started to congeal. I'm not sure if this was due to the kitchen being slow or our waiters inattentiveness! I'm leaning towards the latter

"I stopped at this McDonald's today.  I ordered 2 cheeseburgers and small french fries.  After I paid I pulled up to the next window and waited about a minute before I was acknowledged.

I thought this odd for a restaurant that hypes their fries as one of the mainstays of their menu.

After a couple of more minutes my order was handed to me.  The bad was literally soaked with oil from the fries.  Since I had waited in line and had held up other folks I just took the bag and left.

This place needs some serious help. I understand it's right in the middle of ghetto town USA which is why you shouldn't keep me waiting in the drive thru for 19 minutes for a burger and fries! Plus you added onions and forgot my straw! Huge fail. I would never pay you $15 per hour. Today you were worth 3.35. Won't be back to this location ever,0.0
"It is really unfortunate that this place isn't better than it is for the location. With all of the excellent food offerings in the downtown Las Vegas area, it is extremely important to put ones best foot forward on the food scene. There were several strikes for this restaurant in my opinion, the first being that as soon as my family was seated, we were ignored for at least 15 minutes. With the menu having been studied for at least that long, we were ready to order. The waiter breezed up, took my drink order for ONE BEER and left without getting the food order. The waiter breezed up with the beer, took the food order of filet mignon nachos and an order of shrimp ceviche. The sad nachos arrived to the table with very little cheese, drowned is a terrible sauce, low presence of steak, and sad looking guacamole. The chips were fresh. The ceviche was a no. All around...a no. No flavor, nothing, period! The avocado was fresh. Oh yeah, I wanted another beer, no one ever came back to the table. Once done with dinner, we waited, and waited, and waited for the bill. Finally it shows up and guess how much 1 beer, 1 plate of nachos, and 1 ceviche appetizer cost...OVER FIFTY DOLLARS! Are you kidding me!?! That's even unreasonable for Vegas! We weren't on the main strip. Not even on the Fremont Street strip. I do not recommend this place AT ALL.",0.0

Only ""complaint"" is that you will be here a long time .. 1 hour lunch is normal. You wait to be asked what you want to drink ... 10 minutes later your beers will come from the bar and you will be told ""I'll give you time to look at menu."" 10 minutes later your order is taken .. 20 minutes or more to make a lunch. Great food but don't come here if you are in a hurry. It's  place to go and sit and socialize and sit some more ...",0.0

"Loved this spin class. Came from out of town (Houston and we have high quality spin studios down here) and got my butt kicked. Colby was awesome and was biking along with us- which I always love seeing trainers do the actual workout. She introduced herself before and checked on us after. Also great customer service. The workout had great music but I had a little trouble staying on beat (still fairly new at rhythm based spin) but just don't stop- keep pedaling. There was a lot of movement (taps, side to side, weights, standing) so I felt this was my best full body spin workout. We didn't have the fan on (which you can request) and though I sweat a ton, it didn't feel uncomfortable at all. Challenging but so worth it. Wish I had Rev Cycle down in Htown.",0.0

So, I'm gonna start reviewing them along with my regular grab bag of foodie places. Plus I travel, so I see a lot of Starbucks.  I try to always hit the local places....not always possible. Starbucks is easy to find and familiar.

This Starbucks is located on Main Street in Chagrin Falls, OH.  Super cute town. 

This Starbucks is long, not wide...so it can be tight if they are busy, but there is still ample seating.

Music is a little loud, baristas are pleasant enough, drinks are coming out quick.  Lots of people at tables working.  Actually, all tables are occupied.

We are very familiar with many pizza places across the west and east valley of Phoenix such as Zio's, Grimaldi's, Venezia's, Oreganos, etc and we both agreed this is definitely the best. Their pizza is great, but the service is what sold us. Will definitely come back to try their pasta and other goodies :)",0.0
"Thank Goodness, a company (Dust B Gone) that did what they said they would do!  For years we didn't think it possible to have our saltillo tile removed without moving out of the house first. Finally we got the courage to get an estimate and get it done.  We chose Dust B Gone and we were still skeptical as to about the process. DBG showed up on time, the 3 guys were professional, polite, and we could tell experienced.  They answered our questions, covered the kitchen cupboards with plastic (although the process really didn't need it) and we were amazed at the outcome !  I couldn't believe how smooth the floor was when they were done and they cleaned up nicely before leaving.  There was just a very very small amount of dust (like they said there could be). My husband and I were so pleased with the fabulous job these guys did !  The cost was quite reasonable for the work they did.  Great Work, you guys were awesome !!

"While on our way to Great Wolf Lodge, my ten-year-old son and I dropped by for a burger. We don't have one of these restaurants in our sleepy little town of Greensboro, so thought I'd try something new. When we got there it was about noon on Monday and was quite crowded. Unfamiliar with the place, we foolishly just sat down at the bar. When the cashier finally noticed we hadn't fought through the proper line to give our order, she politely came over and handed us our order forms. Even my son, who was watching the Olympics on TV said, ""Dad, what's taking so long?"" After THIRTY minutes our food came out. While I was waiting, I noticed that there were only two cooks in the tiny kitchen and the one cashier\/waitress. I counted: FIFTY (really, 50) people in the restaurant. Popular? I don't know why. The specialty burgers are just like the overlooked hockey pucks your idiot neighbor down the street cooks while he's drinking one too many six-packs. The onion rings WERE real (and really hot) but that just simply doesn't make up for the rest of the food. The waitress\/cashier took my son's meal off the bill without me asking. She WAS very nice... and apologetic. Midway through our wait, I noticed what appeared to be the manager slink out the front door, giving a feeble wave to the horribly over-worked waitress. If this had been MY franchise, I would've been out there helping out. Guys like this are losers -- this place won't be there forever.
And another odd observation: Do NOT sit at the bar... It is designed so that you cannot reach your food! There's a sloped edge to it that's about 6 ~ 8 inches wide... You can't put your food basket on it so you have to lean waaaay over the edge to get to your food. Bizarre design flaw (and yes, I *am* a designer).

The food was tasty though the pecan dressing on the
salad was so heavy and flattened the greens, it should be
all automatically on the side. Thats what customers want.
 The bread for the turkey sandwich was stale. Store bought
bread, really?, so average.
This is a large restaurant and sits mostly empty during the week
and its the only game in town for full service breakfast.
We left at 1pm, very quiet, eery.

Did not see a manager ever, I suggest to begin straightening
out these yelp reviews, you begin showing appreciation for
what guests you do have, or you will be mediocre forever.
Stop by and touch every table while guests are present,
show appreciation, fix issues immediately and stay 
visible and available. This restaurant is big and feels
awkward when business is soft.

Solutions: Management needs to ""own the business""
You are open only from 7-2:30, be amazing !
Touch every table, ask good questions, be there when
people leave, so there is a source to sound off, if needed
Sense of urgency to maintain perfect service levels
Particion dining roof off so appears to be smaller and
perception is busier, successful
Offer unique, high quality specials on big menu chalkboard 
you have which currently has no message.
Revise menu's , add prices, clean it up
Comp  a unique offering such as a small pastry basket to 
each table as they arrive to have with coffee and while waiting
for their food, differentiate yourself and be consistent.

"If only it were possible to give this place 6 stars!!Had breakfast here on a Sunday morning. If you love breakfast food and you have a big appetite you will love this place! We got there around 1030am and after we sat down the place filled up! A few large groups of people were there and soon there was a line up. Our server was a friendly and muchacho with some pretty awesomely sculpted facial hair. I'm always envious as now being a married muchacho myself with a wife who disdains facial hair of any kind, I sometimes have a little envy for men who are facially hirsute. He thought he recognized me and had welcomed me back. I had never been before but I thought his mentioning it was a nice touch. There is a definite dearth of that kind of customer recognition in the world these days. Put plainly: The food is great! I had eggs, sliced tomatoes, pea meal bacon and home fries. Everything was very tasty and landed on the table in a jiffy! My 3 sunny side up eggs were perfectly Sunny n Runny! The back bacon had me singing Baby Got Back! The crispy seasoned home fries had me thinking I was in a North Carolina greasy spoon! Ruggedly handsome muchacho kept the coffee mug hot and full! Price was great! Next time I find myself anywhere near this place and hungry I will beat down the door to get some breakfast in my belly! They also have a great burger and sammies menu for lunch, I almost ordered a burger. Next time I will!! When I tell you this place is awesome my word is bond!! Baby Got Back!

"I love this place. Best junk food in the valley. No, you aren't going to be eating a salad here (although I did see one on the menu, a Grilled Chicken Salad). Chances are you came here for a sloppy, home made burger, a big chili dog or even a Philly Cheesesteak. Everything is made fresh and delicious. The peanut butter shake is awesome. The owner and his staff are friendly and service is as good as it could get in a place that often has a big line before you order. Sometimes, you have to scrap around for a place to sit down, but it's worth the hassle. I think it's a five-star meal experience, and the only reason I knocked it down to four stars is that the parking lot is a pain in the ass. It's so tight and there are so few spaces -- really dangerous if you've got a nice ride.",0.0

"I had heard good things about this place, and I have been misled.   I went with my wife and some family on a Saturday morning. After waiting for about 20 minutes for our food to come out, we  noticed people who ordered after us were getting their food before us.  I went back to the counter to ask and the cashier had no idea what I was talking about. No one actually gave our order to the kitchen staff.  No apologies.   Food finally came out about 10 minutes later. It's now been approximately 40 minutes since we ordered 2 bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches and a order of French toast.  My sandwich had 2 ""slices"" of bacon on a $7 sandwich. They were extremely thin and tiny.The French toast had strawberries in the side of butter.

"With lots of soup and salad options, I thought there would be ample gluten free choices. Unfortunately the server at the salad bar had some strange answers to my questions. When I asked about soups, he said all vegan soups were gluten free. I asked why it corresponded to vegan and he didn't know. When I pointed out the tomato soup had pasta he said they would make it without. I chose a salad and asked about the dressing. He didn't know and was reluctant to go check. He wanted me to order the herb vinaigrette. I asked him to please check and he quickly came back announcing it had mayo therefore was not. I pointed out that mayo rarely has gluten and that seemed odd. So I chose another salad. ""No, that one has sugar."" I pointed out that sugar is not gluten. He was growing impatient with me and clearly was guessing about something he knew nothing about. We left. I was disappointed and embarrassed because my friend thought she made a great choice for us.

I followed the Yelp app announcement and signed up for their email list in order to get the free lettuce wrap appetizer, which was decent.

When? 5pm on a Sunday in late March

How (did it look\/feel)? Modern, well-designed, with 3 tables against the floor-to-ceiling front windows. Restaurant was half filled and a lot of tables had ordered katsu dishes

What (did we order)?
1) Beef kimchi fried rice + kalbi ribs combo
- Fried rice was flavourful; well portioned to fill one person
- Kalbi ribs slightly undercooked so although it was tender, the meat stuck to the bones

"I'm giving this 2 stars due to the high quality clothing. The staff left much to be desired. I went in to take advantage of the Father's Day sale. The female ""manager"" I'm guessing told me they would honor it ""because I mentioned it"" . So if you didn't mention it you got screwed. One staff member was mocking a customer for calling Simms products ""Simmons"" . If you want Togo to a shop that perpetuates the stodgy stereotype that many have about fly fishing you'll love this place.

Figured that was a good sign of how tasty the food was so I ordered a Hawaiian burger (rehab size) to go with a side of sweet potato tots. I wandered around town until it was ready, about 20 minutes later. Took the burger back to my hotel. It was HUGE. I'm embarrassed to say I ate the entire thing in one sitting. Super juicy, and the aioli on the side was amazing. The tots were a bit soggy...was like eating fried mush. Also, this experience cost me somewhere around $12-14. A little spendy.

My son is 16mos old so I had concerns he wouldn't have much to do but he went all around and found plenty to do. The facility was clean and the girl at the counter answered all of my questions. 
My only complaint and it is minimal is the 3yo and under room had 6-8 year olds in it and they were dominating the entire room, they were building a fort with the blocks and when my son came over to grab a block they stopped him, I grabbed him and went elsewhere.

"It was just OK for my liking. 

My order: Tonkatsu shio black (Small) + Ginger Ale 

Total: more or less $18+ (with tax and tip)

Pros: 
- Ramen noodles were perfectly cooked and chewy 
- Tonkatsu shio black oil soup base was just OK 
- The servers were very nice and polite. Took down our order right away and smiled as well.  Very kind service.

Cons:
-  Stuffing that they include in the soup are pretty much nothing. You have to pay for everything.  So basically your paying for soup, noodles and 1pc of thin meat.
-  Would be nice if they added more green onions, bean sprouts, etc as free stuffings to begin with and then charge extra for more. Because the bowl literally had nothing in it except for soup, noodles and 1 meat.
-  Pricy for the size you get even as a small bowl. Been to better ones then this downtown.
-  Pricy for students. Poor students! Lol

This place had nothing that was great. The coconut shrimp appetizer was not good and the dipping sauce didn't go with it. We had the Cajun fries which were just OK and 1lb shrimp with the everything sauce not very flavorful. To top it off the service was horrible,0.0
"I love the Peppermill. Great place to come for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Especially if you have a hangover! Large portions. The wait can be a bit long so I'd suggest getting a drink in their Fireside Lounge. I love the colorful sugar, fake trees and the funky uniforms. Overall a fun place to go after a long night in Vegas. I've been several times and have never been disappointed. It's like an upper scale, funkier Denny's.",0.0

"Pamela's is pretty great...to start, there will most likely be a wait at the door but if you sign your name up on the paper, you can settle in and think about the delicious crispy outsides of the pancakes you will want to order when your table is ready. We were visiting Pittsburgh for a family event and came across Pamela's in both the strip district and the one on Walnut street. Both are fantastic. I got the broccoli cheese omelette and my boyfriend got banana pancakes with walnuts and the ham and eggs. These are both delicious options. Their special potatoes are delicious. Coffee is brought to the table by the pitcher, which is much appreciated. Cash only, but guess what---it won't be that much because Pamela's is totally reasonable.",0.0
"I've been to many Sunday brunches but this takes the cake. The food is outstanding. There are about 8 stations including a BBQ station, Asian food, Mexican, pasta, seafood and more. Don't load up on the junk like pizza and burgers. Go for the high priced cuts of meat and seafood including stone crab claws and oysters!  And the desert table: OMG! It's about $42 a person, which is pretty reasonable considering all the food you're getting. You can add $18 for all you can drink but it's not worth it unless you like crap beer like Coors or Michelobe. You can also buy a-la-carte drinks.",0.0

"My brother-in-law and his wife moved out to this area of Phoenix and hadn't really explored the restaurant scene too much. We flew in for their housewarming and to meet the new addition to their family (a beautiful baby girl!), and of course left it all to Yelp to find us a good place to eat.

We were a big group - about 10 adults, plus two hungry kids ages 5-6 and a newborn baby. They were able to accommodate us in the outdoor patio seating. One of our party members is vegetarian, and surprisingly, they had a housemade sweet potato black bean veggie burger, and also seasonal veggies that could be ordered on the side. Yay for the accommodations all around!

Because they are using locally sourced, organic, seasonal vegetables, not everything was available to order family style. So, we ordered a small side of the brussel sprouts, and were unable to get french fries to share. (Even the potatoes are organic!)

Their most popular dishes, according to the chef, are the BBQ pork sandwiches, brisket, ribs, and for non-BBQ lovers the chicken is also a favorite. We ordered several of the recommended dishes, beans, cole slaw, potato salad... They have like, 4 kinds of BBQ sauces (some super spicy but sooooo packed with flavor!). Everything was delicious and came out quickly. The chef came out a few times and was very pleasant to chat with.

And in the end? 10 adults, 2 kids, and all that food... was $130. I'm pretty sure I've dropped that much cash for just a party of 3 in California. So 5 stars for the value to food!! Thanks for showing us Californians a good time in Phoenix! Enjoyed the food and highly recommend this establishment!",0.0

"Dinner with friends last night and the first time we've visited Brooklyn Tavern.  I really wanted to love this place and the venue itself is nice.  Our server was super friendly and explained the menu items but confused some of us by offering up different combination options.  We started with the Somewhat Crispy Squid in Black Bean Sauce.  Great.  Nice cook on the squid, lightly battered and the sauce was what you'd expect from an Asian Black Bean sauce.  After ordering we were informed that there was only one Little Havana sandwich left.  It was 7:30pm for goodness sake!  It's not like we were late diners.  So one of us had to change our order.  When the mains came up, one person in our party was delivered the wrong soup and had to wait quite a while for the correct soup - (it's soup, why would this take so long?). The fries that accompanied the burger and the sandwich were so salty, they make McDonald's fries taste bland!  Couldn't eat them.  Cuban sandwich was good.  Burger was well liked all around.  Good drinks (Manhattans) and a nice wine list.  We had the Gen5 chardonnay from Lodi California.  There was a large group in the place that made it excessively noisy but the clientèle was a good mix and was pretty representational of the neighbourhood.  Super rude older guy next to us who was using our bench seat as his personal footrest and seemed like a regular.   I may try this place again as I've heard they do a great brunch, but I was a bit underwhelmed with our experience.",0.0

"I went out for my friends birthday at the epicentre to do some bar hopping. When we got there the bar was packed so we understood that there could some waiting time to get drinks and the cover was only $5 so that was not a problem. The problem was when we got to the bar the bartender served about 5 people who got there after me which was about a 20 minute wait on 1 drink. Once I am able to ask for Hennessy and Coke she makes me a Hennessy and red bull. She tells me the price of the red bull drink, $13, and I alert her that I didn't want that and she makes the new drink. I ask her what's the price on the new drink and she then tells me the price is $13.  In my mind I'm thinking there's no way the those two drinks are the same price but I pay for it and walk away. I head down stairs to the restaurant area where there's a little more light and I notice that I have a filthy sticky glass. I then go ask the bartender in the restaurant area how much a Hennessy and Coke is and they tell $11. My intuitions were correct. I was up-charged $2 for my drinks on top of being given a dirty glass. After that fiasco we left and ended up having a good time at Suite, but I would not recommend blackfinn to anyone.",0.0

"It's a small area, but there's always still a place to sit if you want. They have a menu near the register and a bigger menu on the wall behind the pickup counter.

It's not hard to chew through, but I LOVE my boba with this consistency! I've gotten the almond milk tea, coconut milk tea and the mango green tea and all were amazing.

The special burrata appetizer was served with fruit, so it was lighter and refreshing. I had the tagliatelle for dinner, which was perfectly cooked, and my husband had the shortribs.

I'd recommend the grilled artichoke appetizer and their squid ink pasta.

My other favorite is their mushroom pizza. It all depends on what you are in the mood for, but you can't go wrong at North. Make sure to save room for dessert. Their tiramisu is the best I've had.",0.0

When I've been here before, I was wowed by several items there and the quality and level of exotic choices was high. This time I was impressed with only a few items. My favorite items were the boiled crab legs, hand carved brisket, and they had a jasmine rice pudding shot that was to die amazing. Honorable mention goes to the shucked oysters, and peeled shrimp. Food was good just now ""wow"" enough to justify the price and wait. Seems like the quality has come down since its opening. Service on refills was slow as well.

Later that evening, my eyes started hurting as if my own lashes were pulling tightly every time I blinked. It appears as if several extensions were grouped together glued to my lash line. Not what I expected as I thought I was getting individual lash extensions. Leticia was very nice and professional, but unfortunately, not the quality of work I expected.",0.0

"Really a great place to eat regardless of if you live in Trilogy or not. Breakfast is fresh, haven't had much experience with lunch but my wife had a sandwich that she loved. The Benedict is one of the better I have had. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the wait staff. While very nice, it seems as though there is always someone new who is training. I would assume a high attrition rate contributes to this. It may be had to keel staff there due to the low check amounts caused by great prices....as well as placement in a senior community ( not know for leaving the best tips ). The clubhouse is always clean and presentable. There is a bar and often you will find golfer on their way in or out to play but have never had a experience with drunken weekend warriors there that you find at a number of other clubhouses in the valley. Never had the loud profanity often found in clubhouse bars. It's for this reason that I enjoy taking my two young sons there for breakfast.

The park isn't just beautiful and accommodating to folks, but they also have healthy options as well. If you are around the 127 seating area, you will find an assortment of food from sushi to salads and pulled pork! There are also many ramps, escalators and elevators making it easy to get around. I especially love the BowTie bar near rightfield. It's a fun atmosphere, perfect view of the city and there are typically fireworks or some type of entertainment before and after the game!

I always get fish because I feel like that's why you're there but if you got dragged here by someone awesome there are boring options like chicken or steak for a salad or burrito made with a tortilla (white or whole wheat).

Maybe I should have just to cut the heaviness of the burrito. I feel like it lacked freshness. The beans and cheese on one side of the burrito, vegetables on the other side and a whole bunch of rice in the middle... And yet the only side I found myself eating was the vegetable side because I found the beans\/cheese\/rice mix to be too heavy and dry. I wish it would have had more salsa or some guacamole. A positive is that it was actually spicy, which I enjoyed. Oddly enough I came on a weekday around 7pm and it was crowded with vegetarian hipsters drinking beer and eating chips\/salsa that was on a random table. Lack of variety too. Lots of drinks, lots of sides... But only 3-4 kinds of burritos. *Shrugs* Not for me.",0.0

We're from the east coast so we're on the hunt for all new places to depend on for nourishment when we just #can't. 
The reason I gave 4\/5 stars was that the food wasn't hot when we got it. The crab rangoons were a bit cold and everyone knows the key to a great crab rangoon is having it piping hot...well maybe that's just me but I still would've liked the food to be hotter.

"Where do I even start with this joint...  first I started coming to this facility because the one in Chandler off of the Santan 202 was a complete hell hole nothing but problems at that one. Anyways back in November I had an issue with my 2013 sentra. My vehicle stalled in the middle of a busy intersection . So i carefully was able to get my car off the road. Long story short i was able to drop it off at this Larry H Miller facility overnight and the next morning the service advisor called me his name is Mark he was great kept me informed with what was going on any new news he would call me he was great. come to find out there was an issue with my transmission that also had an open recall that i never got notice about but it was under warranty so they gave me a brand-new transmission and everything seemed fine. Now come December 11 on my birthday of all days my car once again stalled in the middle of a different busy intersection almost getting hit by a HUGE truck! Once again i got my car off the road! Finally was able to bring it back to this Nissan dealership overnight. The next morning never got a call from anybody to tell me what was going on with my vehicle. By around 12 i called in to see what was up. The service advisor his name was Gary was a complete asshole, never once apologized for anything every time I would try to talk he would talk over me without hearing what I had to say and when I told him that once again my vehicle stalled in the middle of an intersection all he said was well this is a different situation it's not the same from last time. Really? After all this ruckus with Gary we asked to speak to somebody that was higher up than him like a manager. he gave us the info for the manager tyrel russel whom we have tried calling many times and no answer or call back! We also got some information on a Bill Brixley and tried calling him MANY times and either it goes to voicemail or the people hang up on us! What kind of service is this!

Molly, as well as the district manager, told me I couldn't have my family rent a unit under that special, because we're related.

Tried the shrimp and grits... never had grits before but I guess I had an expectation that it would be creamy, it was dry and chunky.... also I thought the shrimps would maybe be kinda bigger and more flavourful, they were neither large or had much flavor, and I mean common just remove the tails....

Pizza on 87 has always been my favorite. Their pizza is so delicious. Best I've had in Arizona, hands down. I would eat it every day if I could! They also have super nice employees and their delivery times deserve a gold medal

My only ISSUE with this restaurant is when I order the lamb. Astoria really needs to rest their meat before serving it, because you get great food but it's drenched in a pool of blood because they don't rest their lamb

"I came in for an oil change and asked them to take a look at my brakes and run the check engine code. Dropped the car off at 8AM and was told I could pick it up at 5PM, but I had to call them at 3:30PM because I still hadn't heard from them about an estimate. Their estimate was way higher than the other shops-- I usually don't mind paying a little extra to save me another trip, but this was several hundred dollars more. They also charged me $105 for the check engine light diagnosis, which is frustrating because AutoZone checks the codes for free. Won't be going back.",0.0

"Just like everyone else, I can vouch that their complaints are still valid. Just went today and they still have ill mannered servers, slow service, and cheap quality sushi, which tends to be mushy and dry because it has wayyyyy too much rice. 

The long detailed review, if you care to read more is: 

The service is bad, as servers are rude. Just after the first round of sushi we ordered more but they rejected us because you have to finish EVERY SINGLE PIECE of sushi on your plate (which was like 4 maki pieces). The server even eyed me and told me to stop picking at my rice and fish or he will not bring me more food. The audacity he had to say that to a customer, and not even in a polite manner. If I have leftovers then yes I will pay for it, but what right do you have to refuse me food I am paying for. When I finished my food on the table I even had to prompt him to remind him to give the rest of the food we ordered. 

At the beginning when we sat down I even had to prompt the server to bring us the AYCE menu. When we said AYCE we assumed they would bring the menu so we could start, but 10 mins later with no service I got the clue that I had to ask. I guess they don't think initiative and customer service is essential. They should really retrain their employees if all the Yelp reviewers have the same problem, which is a big indication that it's a problem. Not to mention there were only 2 other diners (groups of 2) when we were there, so not busy at all. Had to prompt them to bring soy sauce too (is that not a sushi staple!?) 

On to the food: way too much rice in the rolls, hence it tastes very dry. Sushi is supposed to be bite sized, but there are just abnormally big. And not a large variety of food. Dynamite rolls are all the same California rolls with different ""toppings"" (salmon on Cali, avocado on Cali, sauce on Cali). One thing that's tricky is you order tempura by number of pieces, so for shrimp tempura which is corrected with white out on top of the veg tempura option. I assumed it is only shrimp as it's corrected. But it turns out that it is not a correction but an addition, so for ONE piece of shrimp you get 3 huge pieces of yam and broccoli.

When we arrived, there were only 3 people inside. But we're so glad we found this place and definitely going back. We tried some of theirs appetizers and they are OK. We ordered mostly nigiri and a roll. The nigiri are amazingly fresh, big slices and underneath small mound of rice. The roll we got was full of crab inside.

"It started out really bad.  After checking in with the hostess, we're told about 10 mins wait and was asked to wait behind the counter.  Twenty-five minutes had passed and as we look around everyone that was waiting before us, including those that came after us, were seated except our party. It was then I've decided to come up to the counter where the manager Ahmad where standing and waited patiently for my turn to speak to him (he was talking to the hostess). He never even bothered to ask if I needed anything... he knew I was there and yet he continued to ignore me while he acknowledged this woman who just walked up to him. So, I finally asked  how much longer do we need to wait before we get seated.  Much to our surprise, they couldn't find our ticket.  My wife and I were furious at that point.  Glad we had Alicia as our server.  She asked how our day was and we told her what just happened.  Apparently, she told another manager,Greg, what happened. Greg approached us immediately, he listened and was very apologetic, and offered us an appetizer.  We politely declined but expressed that we were grateful he came and spoke with us.  Overall, what started as a bad experience turned to a very positive one..... Kudos to Alicia who was very attentive and gave us 5 star service.",0.0

"Easily my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I've been frequenting Harris since the summer I turned 21 as a wee college senior, and this place grew for me to become a staple for my grad school classmates and I for post-exam celebrations, birthday bashes, and general shenanigans. The menagerie of frozen cocktails that Harris slings up throughout the year centers around the crown jewel that is the frozen cosmo, of which I will gladly avail for half-price during happy hour in July and January alike. Also, Tuesday night is bacon night. Need I say more?

Drinks (and free bacon) aside, though, I don't think I've ever had a bad meal at Harris. Highlights over the years have included their turkey burger (look for its Yinzer moniker, ""Thanksgiving in Blawnox,"" on their wholly entertaining food menu), the wings (half-price during HH--get the dry bacon rubbed wings with a side of the Columbian Gum Nummers sauce), the mac 'n cheese (I got some sort of breakfast-style once with peppers, bacon, and fried egg--the M&C is big enough and fun to share, but no judgment from me if yinz want it all to yourself). 

IRL: I took my family here on my grad school graduation day, and despite skepticism (looking at you, mom), everyone loved their meal, from said skeptic mama to my 86-year-old grandfather.

Takes 4 minutes to cook, the Rosa was better of the two. But both good. The GPS got confused and parked us around the block. Service was great, food was great. Like the very thin crust, no sauce pizzas one eats in Italy.  I think the price is a bit on the high side. Pizza & beer shouldn't be more than $15, a limited menu specialty restaurant that flips its tables every 30 minutes and a line at times of the day shouldn't have to charge this much.

"I'm really bummed out about writing a bad review but I've never really seen customer service like this. When I arrived at noon on Saturday to pick up my reserved rental I was treated like I had totally put out the employee by being there. He said they were closed, so I let him know my scheduled pick up time was at noon. Why would the company have this time even as an option if that was the time they were closing down? So after I already felt stupid for my apparent mistake I was told I needed a utility bill paid within the last week and a pay stub.  I didn't see this request when I reserved it online, which was my fault. When I asked what to do in this scenario because all I pay utilities on is my srp m-power box (basically a paperless trail) he told me ""I don't know but we're closed so you should go to the enterprise down the street and ask them"". So I clearly was a problem, so was the other two customers that were complaining that they had been waiting for 45 minutes. All while I was trying to pay for and get denied a vehicle the employees family showed up... I understand now, he wanted to get out of there to hang with his family, screw taking care of the customers efficiently. What a let down.",0.0

My two friends got specialty rolls while I ordered a simple spicy tuna roll. When I saw that they had an oyster menu, I asked how often the oysters were shipped in (since Vegas is a landlocked city, it definitely isn't found in the backyard).

Wings are on the spicy side as a heads up!,0.0
"This place is on a whole new level in the grill cheese game. I had the hot Italian, which was good but I should have ordered without marinara. It was good, but huge even for the half order. It also came with AMAZING fresh cut fries and a yummy pickle. 

The service was great! She explained the menu and even made some great suggestions. She covered the drink menu as well. I chose the electric blue lemonade which was super yummy.

"Ordered 3 chinese chicken salads to eat in and one to go. Simple right...not for them!!! All came without wontons, one had NO chicken, salads mainly lettuce. They forgot to bring the dressing. Had to keep asking for the dressing, the chicken, bread...We asked one person and another would bring the item. Five different people came to our table, none knowing what the other one had been told by us. Very frustrating. The mandarin oranges were well hidden since there were only two in a salad. The to go salad had no wontons, no rice noodles, and only one small dressing when I asked for two. There was no bread- had to ask twice for it. It seems that a restaurant that has been around for some time should know about customer service and how to make one of their most popular salads. No manager ever came to apologize in spite of my telling one of the five people who came to our table during their game of ""telephone"" that they need to stop sending different people who don't know what we told the previous one. Have had similar experiences with to go orders- never seem to get it right and don't seem to care. Very disappointed.",0.0
"i'm a very picky eater, and if it were my choice, i would happily eat at china a go-go or panda express for some ""chinese food"" (i know they are very americanized but, again, i'm picky!). but whenever i happen to come here, i'm with my family (it's usually against my will). now the reason i hate coming here is not because of the food. the food is great. it's well cooked, has lots of flavor, and lots of variety. 

but what i hate is the service here. the servers are very rude. i'm almost positive that they want everyone to know they don't want to be there and they hate all their customers. i kind of even sense some racial prejudice among them as well (my mother is asian and treated only moderately rudely, my father who is black is outright ignored and avoided). but oh well, what's this yelp review going to change about the servers' attitudes?

"We stay nearby a couple times a year and this is our 3rd time hers. First time was amazing (5 stars) but the second took so long(+45 minutes! just for ramen!), that we had to leave (1 star). This time we went early for dinner and it was much less crowded. 

Because we had to wait so long last time, we had the Just Fries for appetizer with pineapple ketchup. They were very good and the pineapple ketchup topped them off great. 

I had Tan Tan Meh (it wasn't on the menu but I had it last time. Tan tan meh is quite spicy-in a good way. It was still good- but it wasn't like the first version (back then it was on the menu & had seafood (shrimps & scallops) and the broth was exquisite! This one had just a bland piece of pork & that's all for the meat.  It was still good but not near as good. 

My husband has Shoyu Ramen.  The Shoyu Ramen broth wasn't very flavorful at all either. It also had the one long bland piece of pork. Meh 

The noodles and the veggies were good but couldn't hold up the ramen by themselves. 

Overall, it was ok but I really think I would try somewhere else next time.

"This place is horrible. Our room was given away after we called to confirm twice! We originally booked for a room with two beds but since they gave away our room they gave us one with one bed. Not only that but when we went up to our room it had a padlock on. We went back down because obviously we couldn't get it. They send us back up with security to get it open, turns out the room is occupied! So ridiculous. To top that off when they finally gave us a room, still with only one bed, none of the keys we got worked! So we wasted more time going back down to the lobby to get keys that actually worked. Worst experience ever. The only good thing I could say about it is the house keepers provided amazing customer service and the shuttles to go to the strip. Other than that I rather pay more than to stay here. And won't recommend to anyone.",0.0

"It's sad that a place with such a beautiful setting is so rundown and under staffed. My son and I just got back from a two night stay and if I knew what we were getting into we would have pitched a tent. The front desk gals were really sweet but that's as far as it goes. When we checked in we were told we were in the 3rd floor.  No biggie right? Wrong. There's no elevator. It wouldn't be so bad if we didn't have all of our snow gear packed. They didn't even offer to help us to our room. Once we got to the room I wanted to step out onto the ""balcony"" and checkout the view. The balcony was a 3x3 platform made out of 2x4s. Nope. Nope. Nope. I wouldn't even let my 50lbs son stand on it. 
We went downstairs for dinner and it took 10-15 mins for us to even get greeted. It was the same way for breakfast too. The food was ok. The servers were nice. You can tell they're overworked though. After a fun day in the snow it was bedtime. The beds are probably the original beds they had when they first opened. I woke up and it felt like an elephant was stepping on my back. I was hoping a nice warm shower might help but when I went to shower I noticed there was no washcloths.  So I asked housekeeping (which was right next door to our room)for a couple and they said they didn't have any. WTH? What hotel runs out of washcloths? I couldn't wait to checkout of this place. But, I had to. I waited at the empty front desk for 15 mins for someone to come help me. I started writing a note and I was going to leave my room cards with it but then finally a lady walked up. She said she was helping the restaurant get ready to open and she was sorry for the wait. Management really needs to get it together before this place goes under. From the looks of it, that's going to happen sooner than later.",0.0

"After 2 years of passing this place to and from work off the 215, my family and I finally decided to try this place. When we arrived, it was an interesting, yet nice theme to the building\/area. Having lived up North and in Texas, I was used to this scene and enjoyed the change from the typical Vegas restaurants. We were ""kinda"" greeted by a lot of cats roaming the area (they must get some food scraps at the end of the night or something). Regardless, my daughter enjoyed seeing those cats. If you're a dog lover, beware! Ha-ha. Anyways, while we were being seated, we got to pass the grill that was cooking all the different cut of meat...such a great sight to see all that. We didn't order any appetizers because I was getting myself prepped for the 32 oz New York Strip. No, that is not a type-o....I meant it all....32 ounces of pure, slab of cow!!! The cool thing about it is if you eat all of the steak, you get a free dessert! Though I'm not a dessert fan, it was a great deal for my family. I was especially shocked on how great the flavor and tenderness were on the steak, considering the size of it. It would be wrong to say the decor is a bit dated, because hey, it's a Western theme dang it... it's supposed to look this way!!! Overall, good service and great food.

"Consensus is that Mon Ami Gabi is the best brunch spot in Las Vegas. Located right on the strip, the expectations were set high. And a New York brunch palette is easy to displease. 

Drinks
Gabi didn't disappoint. The Frangria (the French Sangria) was one of I believe two drinks that came in pitcher sizes, and was adequately sized and quite quenching. 

Appetizers
We ordered Escargot (buttery snails) and the Baked Goat Cheese to start. While the Escargot is always a fun dish - new to some, icky to most, but uniformly just tastes like buttery mushrooms. It's not the restaurants fault - the dish is more of a conversation starter than food. The goat cheese and garlic bread, on the other hand, was pure BLISS. I'm not sure how something so simple tastes so magical. Perhaps we were hungry. We devoured the dish in minutes and were debating cancelling some entrees to get more. 10\/10 would recommend!

Entrees
I personally love quiche Lorraine and was unfortunately very disappointed with the dish. Thats the reason I'm taking a star off. Not much to say - it was dismal and unappetizing. The crust wasn't crunchy, the insides felt try and rubbery. A disaster.
A friend got the French toast, which came with blueberries on top. A standard dish that was as expected.
Another buddy was and has been on a life long quest for maximum fitness and decided he'd only let a fruit salad accentuate his otherwise soylent diet. And this is Vegas we're talking about. Ugh.
The eggs Benedict is a brunch classic. I'd say New York had definitely treated us to better, but all in all not bad. The yolk flowed, but the bread wasnt crispy. Two people got this and were fairly pleased.

Overall
The place is expensive some entrees ranging to the $25-30 range. It's clearly a $$$ place, and expectations are pretty high at that point. If this were in New York, I'd give it a 3 star, but because good dining is rather rare in Vegas (from the few places we went to), and because the goat cheese was some ambrosia-ass shit, 4 stars is it.",0.0

"We've driven by this place several times.  I checked the reviews and was turned off by the fact that they charge for chips and salsa.  I mean, every Mexican restaurant offers complimentary chips and salsa.  I just didn't get it.  Finally, we decided to try it anyway and I am so glad that we did.  The food was excellent!!  Everyone in my family of five was very happy with their food and that rarely happens.  The prices are also beyond reasonable.  Our total came to $55 for five dinners and five beverages.  And again, that rarely happens.  We will be return customers for sure!  I guess you really do pay for those ""complimentary"" chips and salsa in other Mexican restaurants...it's built in to the menus prices.  I'd rather skip the chips and salsa for affordable, delicious food any day.  I can eat chips and salsa at home.",0.0

"First I have to say I have been visiting this restaurant for at least 5 years now, and have never had a disappointing meal.  I read reviews that say much to the contrary and I just have to laugh.  I lived in China myself for two years. The food here is the closest to REAL Chinese food, not Americanized stuff thrown together like a Panda Express etc. where they are marketing to Americans.  

If you find that you do not like the food at Beijing, it is probably because you've never had it prepared like this before.  That's not saying there isn't a place for Panda, but don't discount Beijing if you've never tried it before because of that kind of comparison review.  

For reference, I would say I eat at this place, or have had delivery, at least 12 times per year on average over the past two years since I moved back to Vegas.  

Yes, their chairs could use a cleaning or redo; but having lived in China I recognize that this is just standard; but I am giving them the four stars for this as it is America and we do  have different standards.

I came back to Echo & Rig to try their infamous Happy Hour.  Sounded too good to be true for a nice steak restaurant to have $2 steak & eggs, $2 shrimp cocktail, and $1 hot dogs.  Then they couple that with $3 draft beers.  This is one of the best deals in the city and it's located in high-class Tivoli Village at an outstanding steak restaurant.

The shrimp cocktail could have been a regular appetizer to order off the main menu.  The sauce was delicious and it came with about 20 mini shrimp.  The steak was cooked about medium and was a thin cut, but knowing that it come from the butcherhouse on sight, you know it's solid quality.  The hot dog was literally that, a hot dog, but a tasty one at that.  And did I mention $3 beers?

First off, the e-mailed instructions as to ""where,"" ""when,"" and ""what"" were very thorough and easy to follow. I never felt like I didn't know what was going on.

Second of all...the rest was PERFECT!!

The hostess, Catherine, was excellent! She knew her stuff, she was very personable, she connected with everybody in the group, and she had a fabulous sense of humor!
The food was wonderful. The Godiva Chocolate, the Pistachio Macaroons, the Hawaiian Cookies, the Fruit Tarts, and, my favorite, the S'Mores Flatbread...mmmmmmm...all from famous locations and chefs in Las Vegas!! After tasting the desserts, it was agreed that there was a reason Las Vegas is called ""Sin City."" The desserts were decadent (in a delicious way).

There were a couple of birthday people in the group and we all sang ""Happy Birthday"" to them while they blew out the candles that were provided with the Fruit Tarts (man, were they good too!).

As we walked the tour, we were able to see and learn about many incredible and exciting things indigenous to Las Vegas and the casinos that we were traveling through (The Wynn, The Palazzo, and the Venetian).

I didn't think I was that far though, seemed closer when I drove there last week. So I when I pulled up Yelp it says it's 3.5 miles.. My maps said 4.3 for fastest route. That's still not 5 miles! You bet I called back. It's pathetic giving false information to customers or not even knowing what you're doing. So the girl said she would do it this one time and let me know if I was still too far for future orders(still confused?) she said it'd be about 50 minutes.. More like an hour and 20 mins or so.. Pizza was barely warm and the guy that delivered started off nice and became rude when I told him I wasn't 5 miles and he insisted I was. He pretty much walked away shaking his head not wanting to discus it. It was very awkward. I feel like I seem like that annoying customer lol They need to figure out how they run their delivery service, as you can see I'm not the only one with this same weird complaint, and the other guy was told the delivery radius was 4 miles. Which is it? So I may not be returning. Maybe one day if I'm really craving Pizza (rolling eyes) because as annoying as this was, I'll probably return because it's so good. It's not even fair..",0.0
"The casino floor is so pretty and put together well. It's super clean and not chaotic. They do have $5 minimum tables but it's rare and I could not for the life of me find the blackjack table that I desired. But the layout of the casino works well. Having the (gorgeous) walkway between the table games and the virtual machines is an ingenious way to combine the two worlds of gaming. Having a linear bar alongside the table games is not only convenient but also elegant and adds to the ambience of the casino as a whole. The uniforms on the cocktail waitresses are stunning and again, go well with the casino's motif. It seems that every aspect on the casino floor was well thought out and put together in a cohesive manner.",0.0

"I recently made a trip to Pittsburg, and much to my surprise, the friend I was staying with lives two blocks from Nadine's. I saw this spot on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives a few years ago... Boy is it a dive, but the food was delicious! I had the Reuben and it was outstanding! A lot of meat, smothered in thousand island and melty Swiss, grilled to perfection. The place looks like a shed you would see in a backyard but on the side of a busy street.  The inside isn't much to look at but that's the beauty of it. It was evident they serve a lot of regulars which I personally love to see. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Nadine's, from the ""decor"" to the killer food. I'll make sure to stop in again the next time I visit!",0.0

"They're good for regular service and repairs, and extremely convenient by the subway. Nice people, thoughtful and straight up about stuff, and have always called as soon as the work is done or when they need to ask me about extra work. Never pushy unless there's really something up, which there was with my brakes, but they showed me and explained options. I then read up to make sure I was clear on competitor costs, what work had to be done, etc., and their deal was fair and the warranty good. I've done 6 or 7 oil changes at this Midas, including a couple of the more in-depth package deal seasonal checks\/tune-ups, had them replace brakes and callipers, fix front suspension. 

I took issue with them a couple of times and they were great each time and owned the issue.

The break job they used too much grease so it got grimy and loud, but they redid the job on the spot at no cost and no issues since. Once as part of an inspection I watched a younger technician drive the crap out of my car through the neighbourhood, running a stop sign and squealing around a corner. I called him and the supervisor out on it and the supervisor was clearly apologetic, said he'd speak to him and that it wasn't the first time for this guy, and gave me a reasonable discount on the oil change I was having as apology. 

Another time, after an oil change I came home and oil leaked in my garage. I went back and the supervisor was apologetic and once they figured out what was wrong he actually offered to come clean it up, which was overkill and I didn't need them too, but they gave me a bunch of the kitty litter type stuff to soak up the oil and had me bring it back to them to get rid of (I live pretty close). The oil leak was said to be caused by a warn seal that doesn't get replaced each oil change, but they they said they should have noticed and suggested replacing, so they replaced it afterward free of charge and redid the change. That may have been a bit of a line, I don't know, but they took responsibility and fixed the problem immediately and I haven't had a problem since. 

I was hesitant going there initially because I'd only used Subaru mechanics, but after 4 years I'm fine with this Midas location and have recommended them to friends. I don't think I'd have them work on more complicated repairs but am fine with them replacing stuff that needs replacing from time to time (breaks, etc., and maintenance) and happy to avoid more expensive service options now that I'm well out of the car's warranty. Midas have a mix of technicians, so I get that I won't always the best person and that sometimes shit happens, but they've been clear and seem honest and the two issues in four years they dealt with really professionally. The Midas warranty on a lot of their more major work is good. I have a ten year old Subaru in really good condition that I only put about 10k km each year, so I look after it and do regular maintenance, and they cost just over half what I was paying Subaru.

The large lobster sashimi platter was the most delicious and well presented seafood I have ever had the privilege to experience.

Finally, we also ordered the aburi, which included seven unique pieces of torched nigiri. Each provided a unique twist on this classic treat.

"I am currently sitting in the airport after NOT taking Super Shuttle here, unfortunately. When I arrived in Las Vegas on Tuesday for a fun few days here, I was happy to book with super shuttle as I've used them in the past in other locations. I bought my round trip ticket, and maybe that was my big mistake. The ride to my hotel was fabulous. My driver was awesome and I even tipped him 35%! I had full confidence that my trip back would be just as smooth. However, sadly it was not that way. I had a pick up time of 0630-0645. I was out there at my stop at 0630 on the dot. A woman that had been standing there told me that the driver had come around 0620 called for me and then left. Finding this information out led me to call customer service. After getting transferred, explaining my situation multiple times to multiple representatives, the best they had to say was that I was a ""no show"" so they cancelled my trip but that I could re book and pay for another one if I wanted. I kept telling the lady that I was there at the scheduled time and she just kept telling me the same thing. I ended up taking a cab... My fare was only $2 more than what I paid for the shuttle service. I tipped my cab driver 50% for saving my behind. My cab driver told me that he gets multiple people in the same situation every day... Won't be using this service again... Wasn't worth my time or money!",0.0

"Once in a while, I'll make it into Uptown to check out a new restaurant.  I'm rarely disappointed, and Essex was no exception.  If I had one take-away from this restaurant, it's that the food tasted just as good as it was described on the menu.

I made a reservation earlier that day.  I didn't know how busy it would be on a Thursday, but when I got there, it was packed.  They have a pretty good-sized covered outdoor patio, perfect for people watching after work.  The inside was modern industrial.  I was lucky to get a booth with a window in the back to get a bit of a view without the chilly weather that night.

The waiter and staff was incredibly friendly.  They were attentive and provided some great food and drink recommendations.  I ended up with the Essex Gin and Tonic (YUM).

So we may have gone overboard with the food.  Everything is served tapas style, so it felt like the food just kept coming and coming and coming.  Waiter recommends about 4 dishes per person (we did 6). Trio dip was a big hit for an app, and I highly recommend the Churrasco (favorite of the night).  Four Cheese Flatbread was a really good size and was just as good as a leftover the next day.

"Great Greek food, huge servings, and inexpensive. One plate can reasonably feed two people, what with the massive salad and large sides of rice\/fries offered.

"Thought this place was excellent!  I can't believe it wasn't busier because the food and service were both terrific.  I guess it's because they are about 100 yards off the strip; sort of at the corner of Harmon and Las Vegas Blvd by Buffalo Wild Wings.  We had a hard time finding it because the signs at the Miracle Mile shop showed it right by the Paris hotel but that is not correct.

The skinny margaritas we had were $12 each but very large and tasty.  The shrimp fajitas for two was huge and yummy.  The naked wings were also good and my 'Daddy Bowl' with quinoa and chicken was superb.  All of this food was high quality, reasonably priced and our server Jovanny was super friendly and attentive without being invasive.  Two drinks, an appetizer, shrimp fajitas for two, and the daddy bowl came to $77 after tax excluding tip.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and think if it had a location on the Strip, like where the not nearly as good Cabo Wabo is it'd be an hour wait for a table.",0.0
"This is probably the worst customer service I've ever had from any restaurant. I was just there 1 hours ago to have AYCE with my family. And this is not the first time I eat at Umiya. First, when I walked in, the waitress who works on Tuesday day shift already seem not happy about her job. Then, she sat us at the front table nearest the front entrance and it is 105 degrees outside and they have so many table available. I asked her nicely if I can sit at other table instead. Do you know what she said to me? She said you have to sit here and you can't move to another tables . WTF! The problem I have with her is her fxxking attitude and her facial expression that make me sick. If she doesn't want to be a server, quit and do something else. Then I went to the Chef and let him know what's going on. All the Chef always been great to us when we go there. Then me and my family decided to walk out because I really don't want to see her face for another 45 minutes. I believe one bad server can easily ruin up the restaurant and other people hard work.

"I had dinner at Williams Landing for a friend's birthday party.

In the Liberty Village area, I don't think there's a better place for kicking back and watching the game. It's a very casual, unpretentious setting - something that can't be said for most of the other establishments in the vicinity.

Instead of getting the standard fries with your burger, I definitely encourage you to try the Landing Salad. For a few dollars more, you're getting an incredible salad (especially if you love flavourful, garlic-y greens). Health-wise, I'm sure it's not too much better than an order of fries, but you can trick yourself into thinking otherwise!

Zinburger is part of the Fox Concept group of local restaurants, and every one is a winner.  However, it is pricey.  Zinburger specializes in burgers and no sides come with it.  The $5-$7 sides are good-sized, and include loaded fires, green chili fries, and sweet potato fries (my favorite), as well as onion rings and mac-cheese.  There are also shakes and malts, a little costly for the size.  

But the burgers are worth the price.  The meat is so fresh, so noticeably different from run-of-the-mill burgers.  On the second visit, my friend liked the combination in the West Coast Chicken sandwich, but wanted a burger.  The server didn't hesitate to make that substitution. I ordered a small wedge salad and was slightly disappointed that it wasn't really a wedge, but served as a chopped salad.  But everything was good and my friend raved about her burger.

The seating area is open and energetic. The bar is fun because, when weather permits, one side is open to the outdoors, so seating is almost all around the bar.

"Just dropped in on a Sunday night for a burger and a beer at the bar. They only opened 3 days ago, so there are a few bugs to work out.

This DMV has to be the nicest DMV I've ever been to!  I've been to one in another county multiple times in the last few weeks and had yet to get a DL for various reasons.  I walked in then out in 30 minutes.  Every employee I met was extremely nice and one in particular was not hard to look at :). No one enjoys these trips to the DMV but this one dispels all those awful stereotypes.  Best DMV experience ever!!,0.0
"Review of chicken, not a burger:

"Struggled between giving them 2 stars vs. 1 star.  I made a reservation over 2 weeks in advance for a 16 foot moving truck.  On the day of my move I arrived 20 mins before my appointment time. Though there was only 1 person in front of me in the line, still waited nearly 15 mins in line.  The staff seemed friendly and helpful, so that's the 1 star.  Where I'm not happy is that apparently they nearly didn't have a truck for me even though I made the reservation.  They were saying how they only had one truck left and it has no gas.  It's either that or nothing. So ok, what choice do I have right? The manager there told me when I return the truck to tell the representative at the return center to call him to approve a refund for extra gas. I mean this thing was empty!  Turning on the truck the fuel indicator was at the bottom of the E (EMPTY). So now I have to go out of my way to get gas when I was on a tight schedule...well minor inconvenience, but still a bother.  When I return the truck, the rep is like there's no gas refunds.  I told him to call the manager, which he tried twice, but couldn't reach him.  So the return rep is like we never give out refunds for gas, he's not sure what this other manager is saying.  So technically I paid an extra $15 for the truck rental.",0.0

There are tons of great restaurant options in walking distance. Because it is a historic building with original single pane windows, sometimes you get some noise late at night from people, cars, light rail, etc. on the street, however, I just turn on the fan and it helps to muffle the sound. I have never heard any noise from within the hotel though - it's as quiet as if I'm the only person on the whole floor! I really enjoy staying here when I'm in town.

"I'm rating this 5 stars because it is the best family hotel for kids in Vegas. It is older, dated, smellier, and just simply tacky. But decades ago the property added a indoor amusement park and it simply is a big attractor. You can get some very cheap rooms here and the kids will have fun, but it will change your vacation dynamic because it's on the far north end basically near nothing.  There is a shuttle to Caesars, and you can walk across the street to Wynn and Encore or a bit further down to Treasure Island and Mirage.  I've stayed here and seen Vegas better than staying in key locations on the strip center.  There's something about it that just makes you want to explore out.  

This hotel is particularly great if you have one parent who actually wants to gamble and doesn't care where they gamble.  So the other parent can eat, and play and go to the corny free circus and amusement park for $30 all you can ride all day.  

Also because this is a 3 star hotel it's best to book here directly, but you don't have to worry about a low bid price stealing your 4 star bid.  I like that for it's honesty.

Some negatives-- 
This hotel feels old and dirty. As you walk through the parking garage the soot or smog is so bad, that people have taken off their shoes and slapped the dirt onto the ceilings, so it looks likes 1000s of people ran on the walls and ceiling.  Their is a smell of smoke in some places. And nothing, nothing is updated.  

Positives--
Great for kids when one parent gambles and the other just wants to stay nearby and keep the kids happy.
Most MGM resort properties have a lot of issues with upselling, and making you feel lost or insignificant. That just doesn't happen at this hotel.  I think that one difference in ethos and character is what makes this place a fun 3 star hotel for $50\/60 bucks a night. Simply put this hotel knows it's one step up above a motel 6, and is proud of it and you will have a great time with the right attitude here.",0.0

"This place is a joke don't you come here for  an emergency, even if you been shot and bleeding its 2hr wait and then after they check your vitals in a storage closet you have to wait for a bed... Like they no joke UMC only have about 10-12 beds if that. &I don't understand its a huge hospital with limited beds. &when u do have a bed the doc talks another just to talk to you...

"I had been looking forward to visiting Ricarda's since they had opened. But, a co-worker had eaten there a few weeks back and he was not impressed by his meal. This made me lower my expectations so when I had a lunch with some friends I was pleasantly surprised.
It's pretty obvious that the space is beautifully designed. There is a separate To Go area where you can grab lunch, breads or desserts. They all looked really good from the outside and I will come back to try their offerings. My friends and I sat at the dining area for our meal. The service was polite and quick, but they seem to keep dropping things. Quirky feature was the sandwich board they place at the side of each table to display the specials of the day. There were a lot of choices in the specials as well as the menu. It was nice to see that you can customize salads and flat breads but this seemed to be really extensive.
My friends decided to get their custom salads and I opted for one of the specials, Shrimp and Octopus with Harissa ($18). I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. It had a good amount of spice and there was an abundance of large shrimp and diced octopus with pearl couscous. I would definitely come back for this meal.

Overall, Ricarda's is a nice addition to the area. It's a 3.5 stars for me but I'm bumping to 4.",0.0

Florencia is always a pleasant experience. Note that they really close at 8pm...and you are asked to leave. Also no restroom. Pizza and service are consistent and good with fair prices.

"Stopped by this store to ship an item back I had ordered that was incorrect. The company I purchased the item from kindly sent me a return label, instructed me to place the label on the box, re-tape it and drop it off at a FedEx store. Simple enough. I walked into this store and was greeted promptly. I told the employee I just needed to drop off the item and asked for a receipt so I could track the item. She picked the item up ""Geez, this is pretty heavy, I don't think we can ship it out in this box."" I tell her that it is the same box the item was shipped to me in(via FedEx). She responds ""Some of these boxes are like a one time use thing and we can't reuse them. What we can do is repackage this box for you(for a fee).""

"I used to live near this restaurant and am vegan. They have the best veggie burritos I have ever eaten. In fact, every time I eat at another Mexican restaurant, I am disappointed. They could learn a thing or two from this humble place! The serving size is also great value for the money. 

What makes these veggie burritos so special starts with the tortillas which have an almost crisp, flaky texture. Inside they use diced potatoes, an uncommon but welcome ingredient. Also included are chunks of bell pepper and pleasant proportions of veggies, topped off with a sprinkling of black pepper. I skip the cheese and often have guacamole added.

They have a salsa bar with three different types of salsa. I go for a serving of the red and green. They also have a mixture of marinated carrots, jalapeños, and onions which are nice and soft. I usually eat that by itself and order some to take home to snack upon.

I have since moved away and whenever I am in the area, I make sure to stop by. I have similar small Mexican restaurants near me, but they all disappoint me for the following reasons: The tortillas are nothing special. The insides are nothing but rice and beans--bleh. The portions are small. The salsas are nothing special, and if they happen to have marinated carrots, jalapeños, and onions, the carrots are hard and everything is cut into large pieces that are difficult to eat.",0.0

There are quite a few tables inside the space. Most of them seat two comfortably and many tables are taken by those doing work, but also not a bad place to come for a conversation with a friend!

Been there twice in a week. My front tires were leaking and i needed to get them filled but every gas station i went to the pump was broke so i stopped and asked to get my tires filled. It was FREE! Then a few days later i stopped to get them rotated as my front tires were in pretty bad shape. I ended up buying 2 new ties (im going in a road trip and it was necessary) and it was alot cheaper then i expected. Jayson and another gentleman (not sure of his name) took great care of my car. They estimated 45 minutes but it only took about 15. (Felt like nascar speeds) with the tires i got a warranty (nails and some other accident thingy.) and they offered the same warranty for my other 2 tires for $10 per tire even though i didnt purchase them there. This is definitely the best place to go for tires! So happy to have my baby back in perfect working order.,0.0

I wanted my 6 year old's cute hair to lay under a little nicer, so I told her I wanted her to do more of a graduated bob.

That place needs to hire people who care about having a clean and fresh place to eat and being presentable. Sickest place I have been in a while! I will never go back!,0.0

Very sad to find that it just does not have enough to do. I would have preferred more information and digital interaction. Kids always love it. Food is expensive too for what you get.",0.0

"I can't believe how wonderful the staff was at Hotel Palomar. My husband, Dog(Buddy) and I were staying there because I was seeing a doctor at St.Joseph's Hospital that isn't far from the hotel. I ended up having a procedure done and we had to extend our stay at Hotel Palomar, un expectantly. Tori at the front desk helped us out and was so incredibly accommodating and kind. She went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Her kindness and hospitality really was above and beyond. The valet guys were absolutely amazing and wonderful. When I came back from my procedure they ran and got me a wheel chair that the hotel had because my leg was completely numb and couldn't walk. Another individual who was really helpful was during the hotel happy hour from 5-6 the woman serving the drinks was able to suggest many restaurants that were healthier and Gluten Free. She was really kind also. The free happy hour was awesome! The staff here are absolutely amazing and extremely kind. The hotel itself is in a perfect and safe location. They also were very accommodating with our dog Buddy. There is a small little park right across the street from the hotel if you bring your dog with. Another thing we really enjoyed was the breakfast restaurant that is connected to the hotel on the 2nd floor. We paid $1 extra to get a wonderful breakfast that worked out perfect. Hotel Palomar also has delicious hot and cold brew coffee that they have on the 2nd floor in the morning. The pool was also was really nice to hangout on. The cocktail servers were always checking in for food and drinks. We will definitely be staying here again the next time we are in Phoenix. I can't say enough about how pleased we were with the staff and hotel. Thank you for all of your help Hotel Palomar! We really appreciated it!",0.0
"The worst. Not close to being a Boutique Hotel. Cold hot tub, tiles missing in a dirty elevator, cigarette butts littered the walkways, poor customer service   Upon arrival I was not given an overview of the hotel and the fact that there was Wine Wednesday (free wine) that night. I went to the bar and still was not informed by a rude bartender. When I asked them to remove my wine charge they said they would but it was still on my bill upon checkout. The room was only 2 star and with all this they have the nerve to charge a resort fee??!! Worst hotel I have stayed in this year.",0.0

"The blend is located on the first floor of my apartment building which is dangerous because with the customizations for shakes & protein shakes, I find myself pouring money into the business a few times a week. Although the prices are fairly fair, there are often different deals that can be utilized to get the most for your dollar at the Blend",0.0
Whoa what a surprise this place is great! I walked into this place on a random Friday night to find a live band just killing it on stage with a perfect breeze rolling through the outside venue. The bar staff are crazy fun to be around and really make you feel like a regular no matter who you are in fact all three of the bar staff there the night I walked I  made sure I was taken care of all night. Having the poop tables so close to the bar kinda sucks cause you are always dealing with someone bu.ping I to you trying get to make a shit but that being said it a dive bar I mean what more could you ask it's not a huge spot. But the drinks come fast and the mix on them is just right on the money so you have to give some live for that. I live right down. The street near jokers wild so I will deff be coming in general back to this spot more often I look forward to seeing the comedy night they offer soon.,0.0
